"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          ",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7805478,R01LM009731,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' global health ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Collection ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' Guadeloupe ', ' improved ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Learning ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Methods ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' M.tuberculosis ', ' M.tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phylogeny ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Nature ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Restriction fragment length polymorphism ', ' Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms Molecular Biology ', ' RFLP ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' United States ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' mycobacterial ', ' Biology ', ' success ', ' family genetics ', ' DNA Insertion Elements ', ' insertion sequence ', ' insertion element ', ' Boxing ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Metric ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' DNA Fingerprinting ', ' DNA Typing ', ' DNA Profiling ', ' Gender ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Genomics ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' fight against ', ' genetic variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' patient privacy ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' prototype ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' public health research ', ' relational database ', ' ']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2010,339537,NY-20,0.07606720195906908
"Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The identification of the molecular and cellular basis for adverse events observed in patients immunized against smallpox is of great public health interest. This is especially true today given efforts to defend the U.S. population and military against potential bioterrorism agents. We have shown recently that adverse vents following smallpox vaccination correlate with systemic cytokine patterns, suggesting a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of adverse events. A challenge to further delineating the immunological mechanisms of adverse events is that cytokines rarely act in isolation to induce an immune response, but rather they work in a complex network to which immune system cells respond. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that integrate the activities of immune system cells. While it is often well understood how they act individually, the behavior of cytokines as part of a signaling network is less well known and likely depends on the nature of the infecting organism. We propose to develop and evaluate a comprehensive strategy to identify detailed kinetic cytokine network models associated with adverse events following smallpox vaccination. This strategy will be developed and evaluated using proteomic time-series data available from 103 volunteers that are part of an ongoing NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV). We will develop software tools using machine learning algorithms to automatically discover cytokine signaling network models from observed time-series cytokine expression levels. Once the underlying cytokine network model has been estimated, our goal is to use the dynamic model as a simulation tool to suggest ways to create vaccines that minimize the risk of adverse events associated with vaccination. The software tools developed in this proposal will be generally applicable for biomedical research to understand the biochemical interactions in time-series data, and, thus, a useful and novel software package will be made available to the vaccine research community. The experience and knowledge gained during the collaboration on this important research problem in immunology coupled with the didactic and mentoring portions of the training program will create a firm foundation upon which I can develop and test significant hypotheses for future studies on the immunology of infectious diseases.             ",Cytokine Signaling Network Response to Smallpox Vaccine,7791405,K25AI064625,"['protein expression ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' Engineering ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Vent ', ' Cytokine Network Pathway ', ' Cytokine Network ', ' Cytokine Signaling ', ' Cytokine Signal Transduction ', ' Data ', ' Infectious Disease Immunology ', ' Bacterial/Viral/Mycotic Disease Immunology ', ' Vaccine Research ', ' Immunology ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biochemical ', ' Series ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Kinetics ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Collaborations ', ' Simulate ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Patients ', ' tool ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Smallpox ', ' variola major ', ' small pox ', ' Variola ', ' Smallpox Vaccine ', ' small pox vaccine ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' chemical reaction ', ' experience ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Cells ', ' cytokine ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Bioterrorism ', ' Biological Terrorism ', ' Proteomics ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' volunteer ', ' network models ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,K25,2010,113132,OK-01,0.03253505882603011
"Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to develop a non-invasive procedure for the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The specific goal of the studies proposed in this application is to identify urinary polypeptides that can be used as biomarkers of IgAN. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated elevated levels of IgA and IgG immunoglobulins and IgA-IgG complexes in the urine of IgAN patients using immune complex-specific ELISA. Furthermore, we have identified several potential urinary polypeptide biomarkers for IgAN by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and sequenced some of these polypeptides using tandem mass spectrometry. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the urine proteome of IgAN patients contains disease-specific biomarkers. We propose to test this hypothesis by first confirming our preliminary data through analysis of archival urine samples collected during studies of IgAN from well-characterized patients and controls. We will determine the levels of immunoglobulins and immune complexes using classical and immune complex-specific ELISA protocols with quality assurance and verification by western blot analysis. These data will then be extended by analysis using CE-MS to identify positive and negative biomarkers of disease in which the software tool, MosaCluster, with support vector machines, will be used for classification of samples. This approach will define a membership, with positive values (disease-associated marker) and negative values (marker for normal). The results of ELISA and CE-MS will be compared and correlated with the clinical findings. Candidate biomarkers identified by CE-MS will be further characterized by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance MS to define the amino acid sequence and post- translational modifications. Finally, candidate biomarkers will be verified using an independent cohort of patients and controls. This study is designed to identify markers that can be used to distinguish IgAN from other renal diseases as well as biomarkers of disease progression and severity. Relevance: IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Currently, diagnosis requires an invasive renal biopsy and IgAN is frequently diagnosed at a very late stage. The identification of biomarkers that can be used as the basis of a noninvasive diagnostic test and/or used to monitor the course of the disease would be extremely beneficial.       ",Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy,7896842,R21DK075868,"['Diagnosis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' polypeptide ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Modification ', ' urinary ', ' Future ', ' Glomerulonephritis ', ' Heymann Nephritis ', ' Bright Disease ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Glycopeptides ', ' glycosylation ', ' Metabolic Glycosylation ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Alabama ', ' Capillary Electrophoresis ', ' Capillary Electrophoresis Fractionation ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical Markers ', ' Immunoglobulin A ', ' IgA ', ' IgA1 ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' IgM ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulins ', ' Immune Globulins ', ' Evaluation ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Laboratories ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' Patients ', ' Antigen-Antibody Complex ', ' Immune Complex ', ' Staging ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Western Blotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' interstitial ', ' molecular mass ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' cohort ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' complement C3 precursor ', ' pro-complement 3 ', ' pro-C3 ', ' pro-C 3 ', ' precursor-complement 3 ', ' precursor-C3 ', ' complement component C3 ', ' Proteome ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Proteomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement Membrane Attack Complex ', ' Terminal Complement Complex ', ' Membrane Attack Complex ', ' Cytolytic Terminal Complement Complex ', ' Complement Complex C5b-9 ', ' C5b-9 ', ' C 5b-9 ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' biomarker ', ' Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ', ' FTICR ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2010,183125,AL-07,0.0295231853573128
"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections.

The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.  Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation.     Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB. We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  but  silence  over  the  course  of  several  weeks.  This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model.  Towards  this,  we  have  assembled  a  highly  diverse  and  collaborative  team  including  microbiologists,  aerobiologists,  bioinformaticians,  mathematicians/statisticians,  veterinarians,  veterinary  pathologists, as well as infectious disease and critical respiratory care clinicians/clinician-researchers.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          ",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,8055907,R01LM009731,"['trend ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Collection ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' theories ', ' Visual ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' United States ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Prevention ', ' success ', ' global health ', ' Data Sources ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Genotype ', ' Data ', ' pathogen ', ' International ', ' Investigation ', ' DNA Fingerprinting ', ' DNA Typing ', ' DNA Profiling ', ' Algorithms ', ' Nature ', ' Translating ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Family ', ' Area ', ' programs ', ' Goals ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Work ', ' novel ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Rest ', ' Methods ', ' Population ', ' Address ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Complex ', ' Time ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Learning ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Patients ', ' Genomics ', ' tool ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Link ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Structure ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Pattern ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Source ', ' Modeling ', ' Knowledge ', ' genetic variant ', ' Social Network ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Research Institute ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' public health research ', ' Fingerprint ', ' relational database ', ' Guadeloupe ', ' DNA Insertion Elements ', ' insertion sequence ', ' insertion element ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' fight against ', ' patient privacy ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' M.tuberculosis ', ' M.tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' New York ', ' Cities ', ' prototype ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Trees ', ' mycobacterial ', ' demographics ', ' New York City ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' family genetics ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Metric ', ' ']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2011,325956,NY-20,0.07606720195906908
"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human health has benefited tremendously from the therapeutic application of monoclonal antibodies (mAb), treating painful and devastating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, among others. However, mAb development is a laborious and time consuming process. The health benefits gained from faster mAb development are clear, creating a great need for tools to guide scientists toward discovering the most promising antigenic targets-particularly with regard to B-cell epitopes (the part of an antigen recognized by an antibody). The critical barrier to progress in this domain is the inability to deduce the conformational characteristics of protein sequence in the absence of known structure for predicting linear B-cell epitopes-the largest, most diverse, and pharmaceutically valuable class of known epitopes. The general criticism of existing prediction methods is that they are inaccurate and do not address the conformational nature of B-cell epitopes.  DNASTAR proposes to create a software pipeline that guides the prediction of B-cell epitopes, models the dynamic structural interface between a monoclonal antibody and its experimentally identified antigen, and screens in silico site-directed mutations to engineer more potent antibodies with enhanced binding affinity. The Phase I goal is to improve the prediction of antigenic peptides from target protein sequences and experimental or predicted structures. Toward this goal, DNASTAR has established collaborations with experts in monoclonal antibody production, 3D structure prediction, and protein structure and dynamics, including access to their experimental methods, data, and software tools. Our predictive models will benefit from three key innovations: 1) a superior data set and professional insights into monoclonal antibody production, 2) the introduction of state of the art 3D structure prediction for training our epitope predictors, and 3) the first use of structure-based protein dynamics in B-cell epitope prediction.  At the conclusion of Phase I, we will deliver an enhanced sequence-only B-cell epitope prediction model when compared to current top prediction methods (Aim 1) and a superior sequence and structure-based epitope prediction model using 3D structure prediction and protein dynamics (Aim 2). In creating these models, we will account for the chemical and physical properties of a protein sequence and the biophysics that mediate protein-protein interactions, including solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding, residue flexibility, binding nuclei, and geometric contours of the molecular surface. The proposed software pipeline will be built upon Protean 3D, our new molecular structure and simulation viewer, and will elevate the technical capability of a broad range of experimental scientists to estimate key antigenic structural properties from proteins without known structure-all on their desktop computer. Upon achieving these aims, scientists will recognize that it is no longer adequate to describe B-cell epitopes using amino acid frequencies or propensity scales alone.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Monoclonal antibodies are invaluable tools for diagnosing and treating human diseases. Unfortunately, the experimental methods used today to identify the most promising immunogenic targets are time consuming and less than totally effective. By taking the novel approach of incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from high quality 3D structure predictions within our desktop computer software product, we propose to advance the ability of a broad range of life scientists to properly predict B-cell epitopes (the part of an antigen recognized by an antibody) applicable to their area of interest. This will accelerate the discovery of new monoclonal antibody pharmaceuticals, leading to improved human health across many diseases.           Monoclonal antibodies are invaluable tools for diagnosing and treating human diseases.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised. Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB. We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced in NHP TB lesions, but silence over the course of several weeks. This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model. Towards this, we have assembled a highly diverse and collaborative team including microbiologists, aerobiologists, bioinformaticians, mathematicians/statisticians, veterinarians, veterinary pathologists, as well as infectious disease and critical respiratory care clinicians/clinician-researchers.",Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3. Extension of a newly-initiated toolbox for machine learning applications in molecular evolution. 4. Creation and maintenance of a wiki-themed documentation resource.

"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.           This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data. Ultimately, these methods will allow us to derive information from the vast quantities of molecular and cellular data for personalized, clinical decisions and thus serve as a central component of translational medicine.

"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care.        This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.

A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.

We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced in NHP TB lesions, but silence over the course of several weeks. This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model. Towards this, we have assembled a highly diverse and collaborative team including microbiologists, aerobiologists, bioinformaticians, mathematicians/statisticians, veterinarians, veterinary

"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally. Current practices for identifying appropriate antibodies are expensive and time consuming. We propose to dramatically streamline the monoclonal antibody selection process by combining and enhancing some of the best-in-class software programs and approaches currently available to create a software pipeline to aid users' ability to determine epitopes and model their binding to specific antibodies. The resulting computer simulated models will support major advancements in drug discovery for human health, animal health and related research.            ",Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering,8781169,R44GM100520,"['Algorithms ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' immunoglobulin biosynthesis ', ' antibody biosynthesis ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Antibody Production ', ' Antibody Formation ', ' Immune Complex ', ' Antigen-Antibody Complex ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Epitopes ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Immunological Surface Markers ', ' Immunologic Surface Markers ', ' Cell Surface Antigens ', ' Surface Antigens ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' antibody combining site ', ' Paratopes ', ' Antibody Binding Sites ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' Biological Agent ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Biological Products ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Metabolic Glycosylation ', ' glycosylation ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immunoglobulin Hypervariable Region ', ' Hypervariable Regions ', ' Hypervariable Loop ', ' Complimentarity Determining Region ', ' Complementarity Determining Regions ', ' Libraries ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Structural Models ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Peptides ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Yang ', ' Guidelines ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Epitope Mapping ', ' B-Cell Epitopes ', ' B-Lymphocyte Epitopes ', ' Simulate ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' restraint ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' structural biology ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' kinematics ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Metric ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' Variable Region ', ' Immunoglobulin V ', ' Ig Variable Region ', ' Immunoglobulin Variable Region ', ' drug discovery ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' antigen binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' protein complex ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Protein Region ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Seminal ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' MAb Therapeutics ', ' Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' human disease ', ' usability ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' antibody engineering ', ' public health relevance ', ' drug candidate ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud based ', ' ']",NIGMS,"DNASTAR, INC.",R44,2014,746428,WI-02,0.06494749305723516
"Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that, when deregulated, leads to adverse surgical outcomes including protracted recovery, infection, and organ dysfunction. The immune response to surgery involves complex, multi-cellular mechanisms that are poorly understood. The long-term goals of this proposal are to: 1) use a systems-wide approach to enumerate and characterize the major immune cell subsets, on a cell-by-cell basis, from whole blood samples taken from patients undergoing surgery; 2) understand the mechanistic basis of immune-modulatory interventions designed to improve surgical outcomes (e.g., L-arginine supplementation); 3) understand the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in order to identify specific mechanisms that are critical for patients' recovery from surgery. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gaudilliere will use a next-generation flow cytometry platform (Cytometry by Time of Flight or CyTOF), recently pioneered and brought to practical utility in the laboratory of Dr. Garry Nolan (Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University and primary mentor for this K23 award). Uniting flow cytometry with mass spectrometry enables readouts from rare earth metal isotopes tagged to antibodies. In contrast to traditional fluorescence-based cytometry, the absence of overlap between detection signals allows for a dramatic increase in the number of parameters that can be measured at the single-cell level (currently up to 45). In a pilot study and working under the guidance of Drs. Garry Nolan and Martin Angst (Professor of Anesthesiology, Stanford University), Dr. Gaudilliere established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay with which to monitor the immune response in patients undergoing hip replacement (i.e., total hip arthroplasty). The data from this study form the groundwork for Dr. Gaudilliere's core hypothesis that Surgery-induced Myeloid Cells (SiMCs) phenocopy MDSCs and suppress the CD8+ T cell adaptive immune response to surgery via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 1, Dr. Gaudilliere will build an in vitro system to investigate whether SiMCs suppress terminal effector CD8+ T cell (CD8+Teff) function via an L- arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 2, Dr. Gaudilliere proposes a first interventional clinical trial that will use mass cytometry o investigate whether L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing THA will restore CD8+Teff response in vivo. In Aim 3, Dr. Gaudilliere will adapt and implement statistical tools and learning algorithms (e.g., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO) to investigate whether patient- specific immune features predict surgery-induced expansion of SiMCs and suppression of CD8+Teff cells.  Dr. Gaudilliere is an anesthesiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine with a background in engineering, biochemistry, and molecular biology, and is therefore exceptionally well qualified to address these aims. The Nolan Lab, acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, will provide Dr. Gaudilliere with the opportunity and environment to acquire the skills for him to become a leading expert in this technology. Furthermore, Dr. Gaudilliere is supported by a multidisciplinary and collaborative team with expertise in signaling biology, human immunology, statistics and bio-informatics, and clinical experimental science and trial design. He will also benefit from the combined strength and resources provided by the Stanford Departments of Anesthesiology, Immunology, and Statistics. To accomplish his research goals and prepare him for a career as an independent investigator, Dr. Gaudilliere has created a multi-disciplinary career development plan incorporating: 1) advanced training in human immunology and immune monitoring with mass cytometry; 2) graduate level didactics in epidemiology and mentored training in clinical study design; and 3) graduate level didactics and mentored training in biostatistics, data mining, and application of machine learning methods for the analysis of complex datasets derived from mass cytometry. In summary, single-cell mass cytometry will be utilized to monitor immune responses to surgery at the systems level in vivo. This approach will not only elucidate specific mechanisms (e.g., arginine-dependent SiMC-mediated suppression of CD8+ T cells) but will also characterize these mechanisms as they occur in the context of the entire immune system. The multidimensional attribute of the data will necessarily generate deeper and potentially more clinically relevant hypotheses than previously posed. The output of this proposal constitutes a data-driven strategy to guide future research efforts and R01 applications to identify patient- specific immune traits predictive of surgical outcomes and explore novel immune-modulatory strategies to improve recovery from surgery.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over forty million surgeries are performed annually in the US alone. Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that is associated with significant co-morbidity including protracted recovery, poor wound healing, infection, and organ dysfunction. Our research addresses this serious public health problem by 1) elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the immune response of patients undergoing surgery, 2) characterizing the mechanisms by which immune-modulatory therapies improve surgical outcomes, and 3) identifying patient-specific immunologic markers that determine the immune response to surgery. Knowledge gained from this research is foundational for identifying immune markers that predict recovery from surgery in individual patients and for advancing therapeutic strategies that will improve recovery.            ",Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery,8753053,K23GM111657,"['In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Isotopes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', '

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.

"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care.        This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice.

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally.

"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.            ",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data. Ultimately, these methods will allow us to derive information from the vast quantities of molecular and cellular data for personalized, clinical decisions and thus serve as a central component of translational medicine.",Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research,8995000,R01HL107196,"['Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Data Collection ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pharmacology ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' sound ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Immunology ', ' Immune Markers ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' trait ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' drug metabolism ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' molecular array ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Drug Transport ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Clinical Management ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genetic profiling ', ' translational medicine ', ' open source ', ' reconstitute ', ' reconstitution ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' immune activation ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NHLBI,MOUNT HOLYOKE COLLEGE,R01,2015,385769,MA-01,0.02324991932251616
"Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that, when deregulated, leads to adverse surgical outcomes including protracted recovery, infection, and organ dysfunction. The immune response to surgery involves complex, multi-cellular mechanisms that are poorly understood. The long-term goals of this proposal are to: 1) use a systems-wide approach to enumerate and characterize the major immune cell subsets, on a cell-by-cell basis, from whole blood samples taken from patients undergoing surgery; 2) understand the mechanistic basis of immune-modulatory interventions designed to improve surgical outcomes (e.g., L-arginine supplementation); 3) understand the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in order to identify specific mechanisms that are critical for patients' recovery from surgery. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gaudilliere will use a next-generation flow cytometry platform (Cytometry by Time of Flight or CyTOF), recently pioneered and brought to practical utility in the laboratory of Dr. Garry Nolan (Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University and primary mentor for this K23 award). Uniting flow cytometry with mass spectrometry enables readouts from rare earth metal isotopes tagged to antibodies. In contrast to traditional fluorescence-based cytometry, the absence of overlap between detection signals allows for a dramatic increase in the number of parameters that can be measured at the single-cell level (currently up to 45). In a pilot study and working under the guidance of Drs. Garry Nolan and Martin Angst (Professor of Anesthesiology, Stanford University), Dr. Gaudilliere established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay with which to monitor the immune response in patients undergoing hip replacement (i.e., total hip arthroplasty). The data from this study form the groundwork for Dr. Gaudilliere's core hypothesis that Surgery-induced Myeloid Cells (SiMCs) phenocopy MDSCs and suppress the CD8+ T cell adaptive immune response to surgery via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 1, Dr. Gaudilliere will build an in vitro system to investigate whether SiMCs suppress terminal effector CD8+ T cell (CD8+Teff) function via an L- arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 2, Dr. Gaudilliere proposes a first interventional clinical trial that will use mass cytometry o investigate whether L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing THA will restore CD8+Teff response in vivo. In Aim 3, Dr. Gaudilliere will adapt and implement statistical tools and learning algorithms (e.g., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO) to investigate whether patient- specific immune features predict surgery-induced expansion of SiMCs and suppression of CD8+Teff cells.  Dr. Gaudilliere is an anesthesiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine with a background in engineering, biochemistry, and molecular biology, and is therefore exceptionally well qualified to address these aims. The Nolan Lab, acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, will provide Dr. Gaudilliere with the opportunity and environment to acquire the skills for him to become a leading expert in this technology. Furthermore, Dr. Gaudilliere is supported by a multidisciplinary and collaborative team with expertise in signaling biology, human immunology, statistics and bio-informatics, and clinical experimental science and trial design. He will also benefit from the combined strength and resources provided by the Stanford Departments of Anesthesiology, Immunology, and Statistics. To accomplish his research goals and prepare him for a career as an independent investigator, Dr. Gaudilliere has created a multi-disciplinary career development plan incorporating: 1) advanced training in human immunology and immune monitoring with mass cytometry; 2) graduate level didactics in epidemiology and mentored training in clinical study design; and 3) graduate level didactics and mentored training in biostatistics, data mining, and application of machine learning methods for the analysis of complex datasets derived from mass cytometry. In summary, single-cell mass cytometry will be utilized to monitor immune responses to surgery at the systems level in vivo.

"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care. This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.",Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD,8841749,R01GM097117,"['Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' blood chemistry ', ' Blood Chemical Analyses ', ' Blood Chemical Analysis ', ' Books ', ' Chemistry ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Laboratory Information Systems ', ' Clinical Laboratory Information Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Medical Electronics ', ' Fraud ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' artificial immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Therapy ', ' Antirejection Therapy ', ' Anti-Rejection Therapy ', ' Therapeutic immunosuppression ', ' immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppressions (Physiology) ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Natural immunosuppression ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Immunosurveillance ', ' Immunological Monitoring ', ' Immune Monitoring ', ' Immunologic Monitoring ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' prognostic ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' success ', ' thiopurine ', ' Informatics ', ' Therapeutic Index ', ' novel ', ' response ', ' Advertisements ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' grid computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' computational grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' Secure ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' mathematical methods ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,394118,MI-12,0.008460895346552495
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that, when deregulated, leads to adverse surgical outcomes including protracted recovery, infection, and organ dysfunction. The immune response to surgery involves complex, multi-cellular mechanisms that are poorly understood. The long-term goals of this proposal are to: 1) use a systems-wide approach to enumerate and characterize the major immune cell subsets, on a cell-by-cell basis, from whole blood samples taken from patients undergoing surgery; 2) understand the mechanistic basis of immune-modulatory interventions designed to improve surgical outcomes (e.g., L-arginine supplementation); 3) understand the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in order to identify specific mechanisms that are critical for patients' recovery from surgery. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gaudilliere will use a next-generation flow cytometry platform (Cytometry by Time of Flight or CyTOF), recently pioneered and brought to practical utility in the laboratory of Dr. Garry Nolan (Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University and primary mentor for this K23 award). Uniting flow cytometry with mass spectrometry enables readouts from rare earth metal isotopes tagged to antibodies. In contrast to traditional fluorescence-based cytometry, the absence of overlap between detection signals allows for a dramatic increase in the number of parameters that can be measured at the single-cell level (currently up to 45). In a pilot study and working under the guidance of Drs. Garry Nolan and Martin Angst (Professor of Anesthesiology, Stanford University), Dr. Gaudilliere established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay with which to monitor the immune response in patients undergoing hip replacement (i.e., total hip arthroplasty). The data from this study form the groundwork for Dr. Gaudilliere's core hypothesis that Surgery-induced Myeloid Cells (SiMCs) phenocopy MDSCs and suppress the CD8+ T cell adaptive immune response to surgery via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 1, Dr. Gaudilliere will build an in vitro system to investigate whether SiMCs suppress terminal effector CD8+ T cell (CD8+Teff) function via an L- arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 2, Dr. Gaudilliere proposes a first interventional clinical trial that will use mass cytometry o investigate whether L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing THA will restore CD8+Teff response in vivo. In Aim 3, Dr. Gaudilliere will adapt and implement statistical tools and learning algorithms (e.g., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO) to investigate whether patient- specific immune features predict surgery-induced expansion of SiMCs and suppression of CD8+Teff cells.  Dr. Gaudilliere is an anesthesiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine with a background in engineering, biochemistry, and molecular biology, and is therefore exceptionally well qualified to address these aims. The Nolan Lab, acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, will provide Dr. Gaudilliere with the opportunity and environment to acquire the skills for him to become a leading expert in this technology. Furthermore, Dr. Gaudilliere is supported by a multidisciplinary and collaborative team with expertise in signaling biology, human immunology, statistics and bio-informatics, and clinical experimental science and trial design. He will also benefit from the combined strength and resources provided by the Stanford Departments of Anesthesiology, Immunology, and Statistics. To accomplish his research goals and prepare him for a career as an independent investigator, Dr. Gaudilliere has created a multi-disciplinary career development plan incorporating: 1) advanced training in human immunology and immune monitoring with mass cytometry; 2) graduate level didactics in epidemiology and mentored training in clinical study design; and 3) graduate level didactics and mentored training in biostatistics, data mining, and application of machine learning methods for the analysis of complex datasets derived from mass cytometry.

This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care. This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.",Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD,9059748,R01GM097117,"['Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' blood chemistry ', ' Blood Chemical Analyses ', ' Blood Chemical Analysis ', ' Books ', ' Chemistry ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Laboratory Information Systems ', ' Clinical Laboratory Information Systems ', ' Computers ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Medical Electronics ', ' Fraud ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' artificial immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Therapy ', ' Antirejection Therapy ', ' Anti-Rejection Therapy ', ' Therapeutic immunosuppression ', ' immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Natural immunosuppression ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Immunosurveillance ', ' Immunological Monitoring ', ' Immune Monitoring ', ' Immunologic Monitoring ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' prognostic ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' thiopurine ', ' Informatics ', ' Therapeutic Index ', ' novel ', ' response ', ' Advertisements ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' cost ', ' grid computing ', ' computational grid ', ' computer grid ', ' digital ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' data exchange ', ' data transmission ', ' Secure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' mathematical methods ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,394118,MI-12,0.008460895346552495
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive

"Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction     CD4+ T cells provide numerous protective functions as part of the adaptive immune response, including cytokine-mediated and contact-mediated signals to B cells, CD8+ T cells, and innate- immune cells, as well as direct modes of attack on pathogenic agents. Nevertheless, their most critical roles in defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens are especially poorly understood. A major barrier to both study and vaccine design has been the lack of epitope- specific reagents for counting and tracking CD4+ T cells. We propose to develop a novel and well-validated algorithm for CD4+ T-cell epitope prediction that will enable progress in one of the most promising, yet presently hindered fields of immunology and vaccinology. CD4+ T-cell epitope dominance has been much less predictable than CD8+ T-cell epitope dominance because the class II MHC antigen-presenting protein is less selective and because proteolytic antigen processing has a major influence on the availability of peptide ligands. In the endocytic compartments, proteases act on mostly natively folded antigens, whose 3D structure directs proteolysis to the flexibly disordered segments. Thus, potential MHC-binding sequences in the flexible segments are destroyed, and sequences in the stable antigen segments are preferentially loaded and presented to CD4+ T cells. We will incorporate this bias toward epitope dominance in the stable antigen segments into a computational tool that significantly improves upon existing sequence-based methods for epitope prediction. We will develop our stability-based method using several possible supervised learning techniques, including hidden Markov models and position-specific scoring matrix methods. For soluble antigens, our feature set will be conformational stability data including crystallographic b-factor, surface-accessibility, COREX residue stabilities, and sequence entropy. In order to validate our method, we will use it to predict novel epitopes for 5 soluble secreted antigens from Salmonella typhimurium and Burkholderia pseudomallei, organisms for which CD4+ T-cell immunity is essential. Peptides corresponding to the 80th- percentile of predicted-epitopes will be tested for responses in individual C57BL/6 mice, following two types of exposure to the intact antigens, bacterial infection and subunit vaccination.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CD4+ T cells constitute a major arm of the immune system, recognizing foreign antigens only when small pieces (epitopes) of the antigens are presented to them by other cells. Knowing what epitopes are going to be presented is key to understanding how the immune system works and may tell us how to design vaccines. Existing methods for predicting computational epitope prediction have not considered by the machinery that breaks the antigen into epitopes. We propose to use machine learning techniques to model how antigens are processed using experimental immune response data. The primary outcome of this project is an improved method for CD4+ T cell epitope prediction that can be combined with existing tools.                ",Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction,9019992,R21AI122199,"['Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Epitopes ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-Cells ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II ', ' MHC class II antigen ', ' MHC Class II Protein ', ' MHC Class II Molecule ', ' Immune-Response-Associated Antigens ', ' Immune Response Antigens ', ' Ia-Like Antigens ', ' Ia Antigens ', ' I-A Antigen ', ' Class II Major Histocompatibility Antigens ', ' Class II Antigens ', ' Histocompatibility Antigens Class II ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Protease Gene ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudomonas pseudomallei ', ' P.pseudomallei ', ' P. pseudomallei ', ' B. pseudomallei ', ' Burkholderia pseudomallei ', ' Reagent ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' S.typhimurium ', ' S. typhimurium ', ' Salmonella typhimurium ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccination ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' TimeLine ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' antigen processing ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Epitope Mapping ', ' T-Cell Epitopes ', ' T-Lymphocyte Epitopes ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' Immune ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' Protein Cleavage ', ' Proteolysis ', ' expression cloning ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' Data ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Validation ', ' C57BL/6 Mouse ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' markov model ', ' vaccinology ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' pathogen ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' arm ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIAID,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2016,225750,LA-01,0.05629413811359329
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9382313,R35GM124922,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Connecticut ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' immunological markers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immunologist ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' healthy aging ', ' combat ', ' learning network ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic signature ', ' immune health ', ' immune system health ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2017,471007,ME-02,0.013727627449563238
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9323657,U01AI131344,"['Allergens ', ' Animals ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibodies ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' auto-immune disorder ', ' auto-immune disease ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bacteria ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' cow ', ' bovine ', ' bovid ', ' Bovine Species ', ' Cattle ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' eczematous ', ' Eczematous Dermatitis ', ' Eczema ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Allergy ', ' Food Hypersensitivity ', ' Future ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Immunoglobulin A ', ' IgA ', ' Secretory Immunoglobulin A ', ' Secretory IgA ', ' SIgA ', ' Exocrine IgA ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunoglobulins ', ' Immune Globulins ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Milk ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' plasmocyte ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saliva ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' B-Cell Subsets ', ' B-Lymphocyte Subsets ', ' Measures ', ' Immunology ', ' extrinsic allergic asthma ', ' atopic asthma ', ' Allergic asthma ', ' Extrinsic asthma ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Infant Development ', ' Isotype Switchings ', ' Isotype Switching ', ' Immunoglobulin Class Switchings ', ' Class Switchings ', ' Class Switching ', ' Immunoglobulin Class Switching ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Mucosal Immunity ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' atopy ', ' atopic triad ', ' Atopic Allergy ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' postnatal ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Farming environment ', ' Farm ', ' Allergy to peanuts ', ' peanut allergy ', ' allergic to peanuts ', ' Peanut Hypersensitivity ', ' Groundnut Hypersensitivity ', ' Mennonite ', ' animal data ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' microbial ', ' Memory B-Lymphocyte ', ' Memory B Cell ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Sorting -

"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems

"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,9401936,UG3EB025765,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Red Cell Substitutes ', ' Erythrocyte Substitutes ', ' Artificial Erythrocytes ', ' Artificial Blood ', ' Blood Substitutes ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' bone ', ' bone disorder ', ' Bone Diseases ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Congestive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Dilated Cardiomyopathy ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydroxyldaunorubicin ', ' Hydroxyl Daunorubicin ', ' Doxorubicina ', ' Adriamycine ', ' 14-Hydroxydaunomycin ', ' Doxorubicin ', ' Drug Evaluation Studies ', ' Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Myopathy ', ' muscular disorder ', ' Myopathic disease or syndrome ', ' Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Myopathic Conditions ', ' Muscular Diseases ', ' Muscle Disorders ', ' Muscle Disease ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Protective Agents ', ' Protective Drugs ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' skin disorder ', ' cutaneous disease ', ' Skin Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Skin Diseases ', ' Dermatoses ', ' Cutaneous Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Systemic disease ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' interstitial ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Modality ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Early identification ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' Biomimetics ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Skin ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' Predictive Value ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' Network-based ', ' therapeutic target ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' circulating microRNA ', ' circulating microRNAs ', ' circulating miRNAs ', ' circulating miRNA ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' systemic toxicity ', ' ']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UG3,2017,1256230,NY-13,0.057820842897736466
"Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction     CD4+ T cells provide numerous protective functions as part of the adaptive immune response, including cytokine-mediated and contact-mediated signals to B cells, CD8+ T cells, and innate- immune cells, as well as direct modes of attack on pathogenic agents. Nevertheless, their most critical roles in defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens are especially poorly understood. A major barrier to both study and vaccine design has been the lack of epitope- specific reagents for counting and tracking CD4+ T cells. We propose to develop a novel and well-validated algorithm for CD4+ T-cell epitope prediction that will enable progress in one of the most promising, yet presently hindered fields of immunology and vaccinology. CD4+ T-cell epitope dominance has been much less predictable than CD8+ T-cell epitope dominance because the class II MHC antigen-presenting protein is less selective and because proteolytic antigen processing has a major influence on the availability of peptide ligands. In the endocytic compartments, proteases act on mostly natively folded antigens, whose 3D structure directs proteolysis to the flexibly disordered segments. Thus, potential MHC-binding sequences in the flexible segments are destroyed, and sequences in the stable antigen segments are preferentially loaded and presented to CD4+ T cells. We will incorporate this bias toward epitope dominance in the stable antigen segments into a computational tool that significantly improves upon existing sequence-based methods for epitope prediction. We will develop our stability-based method using several possible supervised learning techniques, including hidden Markov models and position-specific scoring matrix methods. For soluble antigens, our feature set will be conformational stability data including crystallographic b-factor, surface-accessibility, COREX residue stabilities, and sequence entropy. In order to validate our method, we will use it to predict novel epitopes for 5 soluble secreted antigens from Salmonella typhimurium and Burkholderia pseudomallei, organisms for which CD4+ T-cell immunity is essential. Peptides corresponding to the 80th- percentile of predicted-epitopes will be tested for responses in individual C57BL/6 mice, following two types of exposure to the intact antigens, bacterial infection and subunit vaccination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CD4+ T cells constitute a major arm of the immune system, recognizing foreign antigens only when small pieces (epitopes) of the antigens are presented to them by other cells. Knowing what epitopes are going to be presented is key to understanding how the immune system works and may tell us how to design vaccines. Existing methods for predicting computational epitope prediction have not considered by the machinery that breaks the antigen into epitopes. We propose to use machine learning techniques to model how antigens are processed using experimental immune response data. The primary outcome of this project is an improved method for CD4+ T cell epitope prediction that can be combined with existing tools.",Antigen Structure-Based Supervised Learning for CD4+ T-cell Epitope Prediction,9241328,R21AI122199,"['Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Epitopes ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cloning ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II ', ' MHC class II antigen ', ' MHC Class II Protein ', ' MHC Class II Molecule ', ' Immune-Response-Associated Antigens ', ' Immune Response Antigens ', ' Ia-Like Antigens ', ' Ia Antigens ', ' I-A Antigen ', ' Class II Major Histocompatibility Antigens ', ' Class II Antigens ', ' Histocompatibility Antigens Class II ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Protease Gene ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Burkholderia pseudomallei ', ' Pseudomonas pseudomallei ', ' P.pseudomallei ', ' P. pseudomallei ', ' P pseudomallei ', ' B. pseudomallei ', ' B pseudomallei ', ' Reagent ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Salmonella typhimurium ', ' S.typhimurium ', ' S. typhimurium ', ' S typhimurium ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccination ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' TimeLine ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' antigen processing ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' Epitope Mapping ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Entropy ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' Proteolysis ', ' Protein Cleavage ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Data ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Validation ', ' C57BL/6 Mouse ', ' Process ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' markov model ', ' vaccinology ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' pathogen ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' ']",NIAID,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2017,188125,LA-01,0.05629413811359329
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive

"Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that, when deregulated, leads to adverse surgical outcomes including protracted recovery, infection, and organ dysfunction. The immune response to surgery involves complex, multi-cellular mechanisms that are poorly understood. The long-term goals of this proposal are to: 1) use a systems-wide approach to enumerate and characterize the major immune cell subsets, on a cell-by-cell basis, from whole blood samples taken from patients undergoing surgery; 2) understand the mechanistic basis of immune-modulatory interventions designed to improve surgical outcomes (e.g., L-arginine supplementation); 3) understand the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in order to identify specific mechanisms that are critical for patients' recovery from surgery. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gaudilliere will use a next-generation flow cytometry platform (Cytometry by Time of Flight or CyTOF), recently pioneered and brought to practical utility in the laboratory of Dr. Garry Nolan (Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University and primary mentor for this K23 award). Uniting flow cytometry with mass spectrometry enables readouts from rare earth metal isotopes tagged to antibodies. In contrast to traditional fluorescence-based cytometry, the absence of overlap between detection signals allows for a dramatic increase in the number of parameters that can be measured at the single-cell level (currently up to 45). In a pilot study and working under the guidance of Drs. Garry Nolan and Martin Angst (Professor of Anesthesiology, Stanford University), Dr. Gaudilliere established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay with which to monitor the immune response in patients undergoing hip replacement (i.e., total hip arthroplasty). The data from this study form the groundwork for Dr. Gaudilliere's core hypothesis that Surgery-induced Myeloid Cells (SiMCs) phenocopy MDSCs and suppress the CD8+ T cell adaptive immune response to surgery via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 1, Dr. Gaudilliere will build an in vitro system to investigate whether SiMCs suppress terminal effector CD8+ T cell (CD8+Teff) function via an L- arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 2, Dr. Gaudilliere proposes a first interventional clinical trial that will use mass cytometry o investigate whether L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing THA will restore CD8+Teff response in vivo. In Aim 3, Dr. Gaudilliere will adapt and implement statistical tools and learning algorithms (e.g., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO) to investigate whether patient- specific immune features predict surgery-induced expansion of SiMCs and suppression of CD8+Teff cells.  Dr. Gaudilliere is an anesthesiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine with a background in engineering, biochemistry, and molecular biology, and is therefore exceptionally well qualified to address these aims. The Nolan Lab, acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, will provide Dr. Gaudilliere with the opportunity and environment to acquire the skills for him to become a leading expert in this technology. Furthermore, Dr. Gaudilliere is supported by a multidisciplinary and collaborative team with expertise in signaling biology, human immunology, statistics and bio-informatics, and clinical experimental science and trial design. He will also benefit from the combined strength and resources provided by the Stanford Departments of Anesthesiology, Immunology, and Statistics. To accomplish his research goals and prepare him for a career as an independent investigator, Dr. Gaudilliere has created a multi-disciplinary career development plan incorporating: 1) advanced training in human immunology and immune monitoring with mass cytometry; 2) graduate level didactics in epidemiology and mentored training in clinical study design; and 3) graduate level didactics and mentored training in biostatistics, data mining, and application of machine learning methods for the analysis of complex datasets derived from mass cytometry. In summary, single-cell mass cytometry will be utilized to monitor immune responses to surgery at the systems level in vivo. This approach will not only elucidate specific mechanisms (e.g., arginine-dependent SiMC-mediated suppression of CD8+ T cells) but will also characterize these mechanisms as they occur in the context of the entire immune system. The multidimensional attribute of the data will necessarily generate deeper and potentially more clinically relevant hypotheses than previously posed. The output of this proposal constitutes a data-driven strategy to guide future research efforts and R01 applications to identify patient- specific immune traits predictive of surgical outcomes and explore novel immune-modulatory strategies to improve recovery from surgery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over forty million surgeries are performed annually in the US alone. Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that is associated with significant co-morbidity including protracted recovery, poor wound healing, infection, and organ dysfunction. Our research addresses this serious public health problem by 1) elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the immune response of patients undergoing surgery, 2) characterizing the mechanisms by which immune-modulatory therapies improve surgical outcomes, and 3) identifying patient-specific immunologic markers that determine the immune response to surgery. Knowledge gained from this research is foundational for identifying immune markers that predict recovery from surgery in individual patients and for advancing therapeutic strategies that will improve

"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Systems Pharmacological Analysis of Drug Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Project Summary/Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects more than 1 million Americans and has been increasing in prevalence in the last decade. IBD consists of two diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are both characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and can manifest with similar symptoms. Despite their similarities, the diseases are very heterogeneous and consist of complex interactions between the immune system, the microbiome, and the affected tissue. Characterizing the two diseases at the molecular level has been met with limited success, and the lack of a clear mechanistic pathway has resulted in the lack of efficacy of existing treatments in subsets of IBD patients. Previous methods have focused primarily on gene enrichment analysis, but these studies have shown inconsistent results and do not offer mechanistic insights into disease development. Systems pharmacological methods offer several advantages over traditional gene-based approaches by using networks to characterize relationships between genes, which enables the application of powerful analyses using graph theory. These methods enable us to use the topology of protein interaction networks to elucidate disease mechanisms and characterize network perturbations caused by drugs. Furthermore, with the advent of cheaper and more accurate modalities to quantify molecular profiles and the increasing availability of molecular data, we now have the ability to leverage multiple data sources to create a multifaceted approach to understanding the mechanism of IBD. Thus, by combining protein-protein interaction data, drug target data, and drug perturbation data, we aim to (1) construct personalized molecular networks for UC and CD, (2) develop a supervised network method to model drug effects, and (3) identify and validate novel drugs for treatment responders and nonresponders. With success, we will have the ability to distinguish treatment responders from nonresponders and have identified potential novel drug candidates to treat IBD. Furthermore, we will have a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IBD, which will enable the development of more effective therapies to alleviate the suffering of millions worldwide. Project Narrative Inflammatory bowel disease affects over a million people in the United States, and many affected patients do not respond to current therapies. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing methods to discern patients unlikely to respond to these therapies and identifying novel therapeutic agents for drug responders and drug nonresponders.

"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.

"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research.

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community.

"Systems Pharmacological Analysis of Drug Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Project Summary/Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects more than 1 million Americans and has been increasing in prevalence in the last decade. IBD consists of two diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are both characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and can manifest with similar symptoms. Despite their similarities, the diseases are very heterogeneous and consist of complex interactions between the immune system, the microbiome, and the affected tissue. Characterizing the two diseases at the molecular level has been met with limited success, and the lack of a clear mechanistic pathway has resulted in the lack of efficacy of existing treatments in subsets of IBD patients. Previous methods have focused primarily on gene enrichment analysis, but these studies have shown inconsistent results and do not offer mechanistic insights into disease development. Systems pharmacological methods offer several advantages over traditional gene-based approaches by using networks to characterize relationships between genes, which enables the application of powerful analyses using graph theory. These methods enable us to use the topology of protein interaction networks to elucidate disease mechanisms and characterize network perturbations caused by drugs. Furthermore, with the advent of cheaper and more accurate modalities to quantify molecular profiles and the increasing availability of molecular data, we now have the ability to leverage multiple data sources to create a multifaceted approach to understanding the mechanism of IBD. Thus, by combining protein-protein interaction data, drug target data, and drug perturbation data, we aim to (1) construct personalized molecular networks for UC and CD, (2) develop a supervised network method to model drug effects, and (3) identify and validate novel drugs for treatment responders and nonresponders. With success, we will have the ability to distinguish treatment responders from nonresponders and have identified potential novel drug candidates to treat IBD. Furthermore, we will have a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IBD, which will enable the development of more effective therapies to alleviate the suffering of millions worldwide. Project Narrative Inflammatory bowel disease affects over a million people in the United States, and many affected patients do not respond to current therapies. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing methods to discern patients unlikely to respond to these therapies and identifying novel therapeutic agents for drug responders and drug nonresponders.

"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9475020,U54CA225088,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Archives ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Genotype ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' immuno therapy ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Logic ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Newsletter ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Students ', ' Supervision ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Regulatory T-Lymphocyte ', ' regulatory T-cells ', ' Treg ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems

"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health. Project Narrative  This project aims at developing next-generation neutralization fingerprinting algorithms for the analysis of antibody specificities in polyclonal responses against HIV-1.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not.

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9463650,U01AI131344,"['Allergens ', ' Animals ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibodies ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Bacteria ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cattle ', ' cow ', ' bovine ', ' bovid ', ' Bovine Species ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eczema ', ' eczematous ', ' Eczematous Dermatitis ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Hypersensitivity ', ' Food Allergy ', ' Future ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Immunoglobulin A ', ' IgA ', ' Secretory Immunoglobulin A ', ' Secretory IgA ', ' SIgA ', ' Exocrine IgA ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunoglobulins ', ' Immune Globulins ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Milk ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Mucosa ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' plasmocyte ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saliva ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' B-Lymphocyte Subsets ', ' B-Cell Subsets ', ' Measures ', ' Immunology ', ' extrinsic allergic asthma ', ' atopic asthma ', ' Allergic asthma ', ' Extrinsic asthma ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Infant Development ', ' Isotype Switchings ', ' Isotype Switching ', ' Immunoglobulin Class Switchings ', ' Class Switchings ', ' Class Switching ', ' Immunoglobulin Class Switching ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Mucosal Immunity ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' atopy ', ' atopic triad ', ' Atopic Allergy ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' postnatal ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Farming environment ', ' Farm ', ' Allergy to peanuts ', ' peanut allergy ', ' allergic to peanuts ', ' Peanut Hypersensitivity ', ' Groundnut Hypersensitivity ', ' Mennonite ', ' animal data ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' microbial ', ' Memory B-Lymphocyte ', ' Memory B Cell ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Sorting -

"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9707195,R35GM124922,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Connecticut ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' immunological markers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immunologist ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' healthy aging ', ' combat ', ' learning network ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' immune system health ', ' immune health ', ' NGS data ', ' next generation sequence data ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2018,27290,ME-02,0.013727627449563238
"Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  Knowledge from the recent clinical trials suggests that over 80% of head and neck cancer (HNC) are hypo-immunogenic cold tumors and non-responsive to immune checkpoint receptors (ICR) blockade. With the emerging combinatorial strategies for cold cancer, precise identification of this group of tumors is essential for the selection of optimal treatment protocols. However, there is no consistent algorithm available to assess the global immune profile of HNC. Most of the current immunoscore methods are based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a limited panel of biomarkers, which prevents a precise annotation of the landscape of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The IHC method is technically sensitive, and may present inter-institutional and inter-pathologists variations. Moreover, the current immunoscore only emphasizes on a few T-cell subsets, and does not integrate cancer genomic features that modulate tumor response to immune killing. In fact, strong evidence suggests that the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway plays a fundamental role in HNC response to effector immune cells. Thus, leveraging global TIL profiles and cancer genomic features offers an unprecedented opportunity to classify HNC based on its immunogenicity. The current robust methods for cellular deconvolution are sensitive to outliers, which are frequently observed in the whole tumor RNA-Seq datasets. Our recent studies show that a novel machine learning tool Fast And Robust DEconcolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), which adaptively detects and removes outliers, exhibits superior accuracy in immune cell deconvolution. In precise alignment with the FOA, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that a compound immunoscore integrating FARDEEP-assisted TIL deconvolution and cancer genomics can effectively identify cold HNC. To achieve this goal, our two immediate next steps are: **(1) We will develop a robust model-free approach to identify TIL-driving oncogenic pathways; **(2) We will construct a compound immunoscore integrating cancer genomic features and TIL profiles to identify cold HNC. These studies will develop a novel “statistical methodology appropriate for analyzing genome-wide data” and provide “statistical analysis of existing genome-wide data” for an NIDCR priority disease. This project will refine a robust and novel immune-cell deconvolution machine learning tool and characterize central oncogenic pathways that shift the TIL landscape. The new immunogenomics algorithms will streamline the immunoscoring method to effectively stratify HNC and contribute to the precision selection of combinatorial treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The immune microenvironment holds strong potential to complement the current head and neck cancer (HNC) staging system for more effective patient stratification. But the current immunoscores, which depict the infiltration of some subsets of T cells, are limited by the number of evaluated immune-cell subsets and exclusion of biomarkers for cancer sensitivity to immune killing. In this project, we will refine our unique robust methods to integrate global tumor-infiltrating immune cells with cancer genomics, constructing a compound immunoscore for the precise identification of hypo-immunogenic HNC.",Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer,9598702,R03DE027399,"['Algorithms ', ' Interferon-alpha ', ' Lymphoblastoid Interferon ', ' Lymphoblast Interferon ', ' Leukocyte Interferon ', ' Interferon-α ', ' Interferon Alfa-n3 ', ' IFNα ', ' IFNa ', ' IFN-α ', ' IFN Alpha ', ' Ginterferon ', ' G-interferon ', ' Alferon ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Interferon Type I ', ' Interferon Type II ', ' lFN-Gamma ', ' Interferon-gamma ', ' Interferon Gamma ', ' Immune Interferon ', ' IFNγ ', ' IFNG ', ' IFN-γ ', ' IFN-g ', ' IFN-Gamma ', ' Gamma interferon ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Weight ', ' Lymphocyte Subset ', ' Lymphocyte Subpopulations ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' T-Lymphocyte Subsets ', ' T-Cell Subsets ', ' Group Identifications ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' prognostic ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Infiltration ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Cancer Vaccines ', ' vaccine for cancer ', ' Tumor Vaccines ', ' Neoplasm Vaccines ', ' Antineoplastic Vaccine ', ' chemoradiation ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Clinic ', ' Staging System ', ' Techniques ', ' receptor expression ', ' novel ', ' Exclusion ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' immunogenic ', ' Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' SCCHN ', ' Head and Neck Carcinoma ', ' HNSCC ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Receptor Inhibition ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' immunogenicity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Oncogenic ', ' combinatorial ', ' tumor ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' inter-institutional ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker panel ', ' cancer markers ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' prognostic performance ', ' Immune Checkpoint ', ' recruit ', ' checkpoint receptors ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Tumor-infiltrating immune cells ', ' Immunogenomics ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2018,176339,MI-12,0.0032406969242005793
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Partelligence Abstract Halo Labs proposes to develop “Partelligence” a particle ID technique that enables accurate and rapid identification of contaminating particles in biopharmaceutical formulations. Protein therapeutics currently represent between 15 and 30% of the overall pharmaceutical market. The primary concern for this class of therapeutics is that they can elicit an immune response from patients who develop anti- drug antibodies. The drug’s effect is therefore eliminated between 1 and 10 percent of patients who return to their original disease state. The presence of particulate matter in these therapeutics (e.g. shed glass from a syringe or a protein aggregate) can enhance this immune response and, due to the patient safety risk the FDA regulates the amount of particles that can be present. There are always some number of particles in each injected sample, and although their presence can be detected, they don’t know what the particles actually are. A QC tool that can identify the particles would help manufactures trace them back to their source (e.g. a bad lot of syringes) and eliminate them. Partelligence aims to make particle identification routine in biopharma QC. The technology builds off our current instrument, Horizon, which was launched in mid-2017 and already sold to some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. The technique works by analyzing several combinatorial features including size, morphology, optical contrast, and intrinsic fluorescence, and in this proposal we will test which features are key to enable the most accurate and rapid particle recognition. To date, we have performed feasibility experiments validating our ability to identify a few commonly found particles in biopharma solutions. Given this, our goals in Phase I are to expand on these studies by building a comprehensive training set and by testing a number of different algorithms. We will first start with reference samples, and then move to real biopharmaceutical samples provided by our pharma collaborators.

"Alicanto:  Proteogenomic discovery of single chain antibodies in llama Antibodies are a key component of the adaptive immune system, released in response to disease in order to target foreign molecular surfaces. Due to their capacity for high target affinity and specificity, they’ve become one of the fastest growing classes of therapeutic molecules addressing a range of disease including infectious diseases, auto-immune diseases, and cancer. Camelids, including llamas, camels, and alpacas, produce a unique repertoire of antibodies that includes both dual chain antibodies and single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies, due to their comparative structural simplicity, are simpler to express and develop at the scale required for therapeutics. In addition, single chain antibodies are able to bind to small epitopes, such as enzyme active sites, that would be hidden to larger, dual chain antibodies. The binding domain of the single chain antibody may be small enough to infiltrate traditionally difficult to access tissues, including crossing the blood-brain barrier.  Current approaches to single chain antibody discovery require the collection of cells that encode the antibody genes, including memory B cells and plasma cells. Target-specific antibodies are selected after the antibody transcripts are cloned into a display system, such as phage or yeast. While memory B cells and plasma cells represent only a minute fraction of the cells located in peripheral blood, target- specific antibodies are present in high concentration in blood after an infection. Each plasma cell can secrete thousands of antibodies per minute. Digital Proteomics is developing Alicanto, a technology that utilizes the antibodies circulating in blood to identify target-specific antibodies.  Alicanto integrates two sources of information about the antibody repertoire. First, Alicanto constructs a database of potential antigen-specific antibodies by performing next-generation sequencing of antibody transcripts. Next, Alicanto enriches for target-specific antibodies from the blood using affinity chromatography and subjects the antibodies to tandem mass spectrometry. Finally, Alicanto uses machine learning models to integrate the sequencing and mass spectrometry data to derive a collection of target-specific antibody candidates. For single chain antibody discovery, Alicanto will use specialized primers and enrichment techniques to isolate only the subset of the antibody repertoire that contains the single chain antibodies. Alicanto will be used to discover high affinity, single chain antibodies for development as therapeutic molecules. Antibodies are produced natively in humans to fight disease and the molecules have garnered significant attention due to their therapeutic potential. Single-chain antibodies, which are smaller than conventional antibodies, represent a new frontier for antibody-based therapeutics due to their ability to target molecular surfaces that would be hidden to larger antibodies, as well as the relative simplicity of their development. Digital Proteomics is developing Alicanto to discover single-chain antibodies in llama that can be developed into human therapies.",Alicanto:  Proteogenomic discovery of single chain antibodies in llama,9622824,R43AI141046,"['Alpaca ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' mAbs ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Epitopes ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Attention ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Phages ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Camels ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cations ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Affinity Chromatography ', ' affinity purification ', ' Cloning ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gel ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization Schedule ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Llama ', ' Methods ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' plasmocyte ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ', ' Thrombotic Thrombopenic Purpura ', ' Moschkowitz Disease ', ' Oryctolagus cuniculus ', ' Rabbits Mammals ', ' Rabbits ', ' Domestic Rabbit ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spleen ', ' Spleen Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Genus staphylococcus ', ' Staphylococcus ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Venoms ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' G-substrate ', ' protein G ', ' cerebellum protein substrate for cGMP dependent protein kinase ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Surface ', ' Active Sites ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' antibody-based treatment ', ' antibody-based therapeutics ', ' antibody treatment ', ' antibody based therapies ', ' Antibody Therapy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Aspirate substance ', ' Aspirate ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' fighting ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' dimer ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' melting ', ' Memory B-Lymphocyte ', ' Memory B Cell ', ' Cell Fraction ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Homo ', ' polypeptide ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Collection ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' frontier ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Microbe ', ' comparative ', ' B cell repertoire ', ' antibody engineering ', ' single domain antibodies ', ' sdAb ', ' nanobody ', ' nanobodies ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' screening ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical properties ', ' neglected tropical diseases ', ' Industry Standard ', ' proteogenomics ', ' Adaptive Immune System ', ' therapeutic candidate ', ' ']",NIAID,DIGITAL PROTEOMICS LLC,R43,2018,170108,CA-52,0.08816266855671502
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults.

"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9520706,R01CA218094,"['Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antibody Affinity ', ' antigen antibody affinity ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Fc Receptor ', ' antibody receptor ', ' Research ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Training ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' Performance ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Phage Display ', ' Update ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' Molecular Machines ', ' human disease ', ' iterative design ', ' commercialization ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' mathematical methods ', ' cloud based ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Immunize ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,591130,MA-07,0.07862162145024029
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9595726,R01AI135115,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cholera ', ' Cholera Vaccine ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Haiti ', ' Health care facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sanitation ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vibrio cholerae ', ' Vibrio comma ', ' V.cholerae ', ' V. cholerae ', ' V cholerae ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Logistics ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' Vibrio cholerae O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V. cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V. cholerae O1 ', ' V cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V cholerae O1 ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' fighting ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' Antibody Response ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Haitian ', ' Bangladeshi ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,750105,UT-02,0.06030854618587055
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers.

"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology.

"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer. The proposal will allow for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis.

"SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems  Approach for Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Mobile Health Technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to reduce the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor communities. Reducing the TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the TB epidemic in high-burden areas. The main objective of this proposal is to expedite the TB diagnosis process by developing novel image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images thus reducing patient wait times for being diagnosed with TB. The study will be conducted in the district of Carabayllo, a densely occupied, high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Perú. Efforts to develop the proposed user-centered, mobile device-based computing system are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and its strategic goals 2 and 4 in particular-the proposed socio-technical intervention aims at developing biomedical imaging techniques (i.e. wireless and image sensing/analyzing) to enable a point-of-care mobile device-based computing system for TB screening and diagnostic. Anticipated outcomes include a) a large-scale, real-world, well-annotated, and public available chest X-ray image database for TB screening, b) development of new image analysis techniques for X-ray image capturing and pre- processing, and c) novel learning-based feature extraction and classification algorithms. This  interdisciplinary effort, involving community, university, hospitals and health care establishments in all stages of the research, responds to the need for increased partnerships between academia and community stakeholders, and the potential for building capacity in biomedical and technology solutions for health in both directions (North-South, South-North). Its scientific contribution lies in the intersection of three NIBIB scientific program areas including image processing, telehealth, and biomedical informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public and global health because it offers a socio-technical solution for resource-poor communities severely affected by TB. Outcomes of this project will contribute significantly to improving specific healthcare processes affecting hard-to-reach communities that are socially excluded and lack the benefits of technological advances while broadening our understanding about effective human centered designs to improve healthcare systems with mobile computing technologies.",SCH: INT A.Soclotechnilcal Systems Systems

"Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, resulting in dramatic anti-tumor responses in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% show any survival benefit, and of these it is not clear what predicts response. ICIs have been thought to work primarily through reactivation of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8s) residing within the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Recent work, however, indicates that various CD4+ T cell populations outside the tumor microenvironment (peripheral immune system) likely play critical roles in carrying out anti-tumor immune responses. Given increasing evidence that immune cells other than CD8s are important for anti-tumor immunity, it is critical to identify and characterize these cells in order to understand their roles during HNSCC tumorigenesis and ICI therapy, which are currently unknown. This proposal by Dr. Kyle Jones, DDS, PhD seeks to significantly advance our understanding of cancer immunology in the context of HNSCC tumors, with the ultimate goal of improving existing ICI therapies and developing new treatment strategies. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, he will use a novel systems biology approach to accomplish the following Aims: (AIM 1) Quantify the effects that HNSCC tumors have on systemic immunity and determine if these changes are conserved across tumor, blood, and regional lymph nodes; (AIM 2) Determine how the ICI atezolizumab alters the intratumoral and peripheral immune states of HNSCC patients and if these changes are associated with tumor response to therapy. These Aims will define how HNSCC tumors alter the composition and function of patients' immune systems at single cell and systems levels as well as identify/characterize the specific immune cells that contribute to anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones will use high throughput single-cell methods such as mass cytometry, multiplexed ion beam imaging, and single-cell RNAseq along with established analytic pipelines on HNSCC patient specimens obtained before and after ICI therapy. The innovation of this approach, which permits simultaneous study of all immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, will reveal how changes in any individual immune cell population affects the overall immune state. It will also be important for the discovery of additional immune cell populations and biomarkers associated with HNSCC anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones's long-term career goal is to become an expert, leader, and independent translational scientist in the fields of head and neck cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Through this K23 award, he will obtain the additional training in experimental immunology, single cell analysis methods, computer programming, advanced statistical methods, and career development he needs to successfully achieve this goal.

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut.

When multiple new antibodies are discovered against the whole antigen, their epitopes and, therefore, potential novelty and mechanism of action are usually unknown Site-directed mutagenesis, the routine method for epitope mapping, requires testing a large number of mutants since any part of the antigen can potentially form an epitope The goal of this proposal is developing methodology and software for the accurate computational prediction of discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on the structure of an antigen and the structure or sequence of an antibody. Our starting point is PIPER, a protein-protein docking program licensed by Acpharis from Boston University. PIPER is the docking engine in the software packages BioLuminate by Schrodinger and the CyrusBench Suite of Cyrus Biotechnology, as well as in the public server ClusPro. PIPER has a special option for antibody-antigen docking, and has been used for epitope prediction. However, in its present form the software generally results in a high number of putative epitopes, and more accurate prediction requires substantial experimental efforts, e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis. We will modify PIPER to maximize the information available from the docking by generating a large ensemble of low energy docked structures and calculating a contact map rather than discrete docked structures. The number of potential epitopes will be further reduced by a template-based approach based on vector contact maps to characterize antibody-antigen interfaces. We also explore predicting the epitope based on models of the CDR regions. Generating large ensembles of docked structures with a large variety of CDR conformations will reduce the sensitivity of the method to inevitable modeling and docking uncertainty. By increasing the reliability of the predicted epitopes, we expect to reduce or even to eliminate the need for mutagenesis experiments. Finally, we will develop a machine- learning algorithm for the mapping of amino acid composition of CDR regions into epitope composition, a method that can be used when only the antibody sequence available and structure prediction is uncertain due to the lack of suitable templates. When multiple new antibodies are discovered against a whole antigen, their epitopes and, therefore, potential novelty and mechanism of action are usually unknown. Computational software tools can significantly reduce experimental efforts required for epitope determination by guiding experimental efforts toward most probable epitope locations.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist.

"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9753292,R35GM124922,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Connecticut ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' immunological markers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' Immunologist ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' epigenomics ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' healthy aging ', ' combat ', ' learning network ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic signature ', ' genomic classifier ', ' immune health ', ' immune system health ', ' next generation sequence data ', ' NGS data ', ' informatics\xa0tool ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,468156,ME-02,0.013727627449563238
"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner.

"The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers Project Summary  One of the most glaring yet easily addressable gaps in our current scientific workflow and publication system is improving the way that methods are reported, in particular, the lack of key methodological details necessary for interpreting and reproducing a study. Most authors continue to cite the name of the reagent, like an antibody using the vendor, and the city where the vendor is located, but omit the catalog and lot number making antibodies very difficult to track down, thereby reducing reproducibility of the paper. The Resource Identification, RRID, Initiative has successfully implemented a solution to this lack of identification, by asking authors to include a persistent unique identifier (RRID) for each antibody along with a standard syntax that includes the lot information. This syntax is now required in about 100 journals and accepted in at least 400, was accepted into the EQUATOR network of standards and is under consideration by the JATS committee, the NISO standard for journal article metadata. For antibodies, RRIDs are assigned by the AntibodyRegistry.org, which accepts full catalogs from antibody companies and individual antibody records from authors, who are unable to locate the record for the antibody that they used in a study or one which they created in their lab. This process should be made as easy as possible for authors, and through text analysis we have devised a set of tools that should help authors create better records with less work.  The AntibodyRegistry.org was created as part of an academic project and it has successfully incorporated millions of antibody records, thousands of which have now been cited in scientific papers using the RRID syntax. The use of RRID is growing, and in order to support the longer term sustainability of the AntibodyRegistry.org, a core community authority for RRIDs, this resource needs to be enhanced to align with the available commercial and non-commercial funding sources. We propose the addition of features, valuable to antibody companies and journals, to improve market intelligence and reporting around antibodies. We also propose to auto-generate antibody entries for authors and curators when submitting/curating an antibody to decrease the time it takes to complete the task, thereby reducing the barrier to entry and cost. Project Narrative The AntibodyRegistry.org is a catalog of antibodies used in research and serves as the antibody identifier source for the Research Resource Identifier (RRID) initiative. The use of these identifiers improves rigor and transparency in compliance with both journal and NIH standards. As the RRID initiative grows, the AntibodyRegistry.org is becoming an increasingly well-used and valuable resource; requiring increased attention from curation staff. Improvements to the AntibodyRegistry.org are needed to increase commercial value and thereby its sustainability, decrease curation cost, and provide a higher level of service to the scientific community.",The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers,9680073,R41GM131551,"['Antibodies ', ' Asia ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Environment ', ' Europe ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Intelligence ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Reagent ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Businesses ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' Glare ', ' journal article ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' authority ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' information framework ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Data Analytics ', ' ']",NIGMS,"SCICRUNCH, INC.",R41,2019,149373,CA-52,0.08372957662822125
"Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis HIV-associated immunosuppression portends high risk for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Despite progress that has increased HIV testing and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in resource-limited settings, the incidence and mortality of CM remain very high. In addition, ART can elicit immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS), and CM also occurs in HIV- persons, including recipients of solid organ transplants and biologics. There are no host biomarkers to predict which HIV-infected (HIV+) patients will develop CM or C- IRIS. We are interested in the role antibody (Ab) immunity may play in resistance to CM, which is rare in people with intact immunity. We have contributed significant knowledge in this area, including recent data showing lower natural Laminarin (a β-glucan)-binding Ab levels in HIV+ patients with C-IRIS and positive serum cryptococcal antigen tests. Studies of HIV+ and HIV- patients revealed perturbations in Ab repertoires of patients with CM and C-IRIS, and lower IgM memory B cell levels in patients with CM. In mice, IgM memory homologs, B-1 cells and/or naïve IgM enhanced resistance to CM. These cells make Abs that bind microbial carbohydrates, e.g. the β-glucans on the Cn cell wall. The goal of this project is to probe the link between natural Ab and B cell responses to Cn and resistance to CM. We hypothesize CM risk will associate with deficiency of specific Cn- and/or β-glucan-binding Abs, stemming from B cell repertoire pertubations. Our aims are 1] To characterize Cn- and β-glucan-binding Abs of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, isolate monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) from normal persons and test their efficacy in mouse models. 2] To determine the ability of huMabs and GXM- and β-glucan-binding Abs to 1] exert direct effects on Cn viability and biology, and/or 2] mediate human effector cell Cn phagocytosis and/or killing. 3] To analyze B cell subsets, VH/VL repertoires, and transcriptional pathways of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, and controls, and use statistical modeling to identify signatures of CM risk. Knowledge gained from this project will inform tools to predict CM and C-IRIS risk, overcome roadblocks to diagnosis and therapy, provide new insight into the pathogenesis of CM, and inform development of immunotherapy and vaccines. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes a devastating form of meningitis that occurs most commonly in HIV-infected patients with profound T cell deficiency, but also occurs in patients with organ transplants, on biologics, and people with no apparent immune deficiency. Although anti-retroviral therapy has reduced the risk of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in resourced areas, CM continues to ravage HIV-infected patients in Africa, Asia and other areas, even with increased availability of anti-retroviral and anti-fungal therapy. The 6- month survival of CM in resource-limited settings is 45-55%. This is worse than glioblastoma multiforme (66% 2-year survival). At present, there is no way to identify patients who will develop cryptococcosis. The goal of this application is to identify a risk profile to help determine which patients are at risk for CM. This will have a significant impact on prevention, diagnosis, and care of patients with CM and be a major public and global health advance.","Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human

"Systems Pharmacological Analysis of Drug Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Project Summary/Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects more than 1 million Americans and has been increasing in prevalence in the last decade. IBD consists of two diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are both characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and can manifest with similar symptoms. Despite their similarities, the diseases are very heterogeneous and consist of complex interactions between the immune system, the microbiome, and the affected tissue. Characterizing the two diseases at the molecular level has been met with limited success, and the lack of a clear mechanistic pathway has resulted in the lack of efficacy of existing treatments in subsets of IBD patients. Previous methods have focused primarily on gene enrichment analysis, but these studies have shown inconsistent results and do not offer mechanistic insights into disease development. Systems pharmacological methods offer several advantages over traditional gene-based approaches by using networks to characterize relationships between genes, which enables the application of powerful analyses using graph theory. These methods enable us to use the topology of protein interaction networks to elucidate disease mechanisms and characterize network perturbations caused by drugs. Furthermore, with the advent of cheaper and more accurate modalities to quantify molecular profiles and the increasing availability of molecular data, we now have the ability to leverage multiple data sources to create a multifaceted approach to understanding the mechanism of IBD. Thus, by combining protein-protein interaction data, drug target data, and drug perturbation data, we aim to (1) construct personalized molecular networks for UC and CD, (2) develop a supervised network method to model drug effects, and (3) identify and validate novel drugs for treatment responders and nonresponders. With success, we will have the ability to distinguish treatment responders from nonresponders and have identified potential novel drug candidates to treat IBD. Furthermore, we will have a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IBD, which will enable the development of more effective therapies to alleviate the suffering of millions worldwide. Project Narrative Inflammatory bowel disease affects over a million people in the United States, and many affected patients do not respond to current therapies. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing methods to discern patients unlikely to respond to these therapies and identifying novel therapeutic agents for drug responders and drug nonresponders. The results of this proposal have the potential to impact treatment strategies and is relevant to the improved treatment and clinical care of inflammatory bowel disease.",Systems Pharmacological Analysis of Drug Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,9754760,F30AI124553,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Affect ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', "" Crohn's disorder "", "" Crohn's "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Foundations ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Proteins ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' American ', ' success ', ' drug efficacy ', ' infliximab ', ' monoclonal antibody cA2 ', ' Remicade ', ' MAb cA2 ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modality ', ' TNF gene ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' TNFα ', ' TNFA ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Cachectin ', ' (TNF)-α ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Collection ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Network-based ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' drug candidate ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' network architecture ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' graph theory ', ' treatment responders ', ' therapy responders ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' predictive signature ', ' drug response prediction ', ' Predict drug response ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,34864,CA-18,0.02934899677763598
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.

"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure.

"Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling condition for 2.5 million Americans associated with  prolonged fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and sleep disturbances. The cause of CFS remains  unknown, and there are currently no available diagnostic tests to confirm disease. However, a  substantial number of immune features have been measured in CFS. Given this problem, the objective  of this project is to identify a panel of distinct antibody epitopes that can be used to identify  cases of CFS using a blood test. In Aim 1, we will apply serum epitope repertoire analysis to  determine the antibody epitope repertoires within a cohort of 200 CFS patients and 175  controls. Antibody epitopes occurring in CFS sera, and not controls will be identified   using bioinformatics methods. A panel of motifs will be downselected using machine  learning to optimize sensitivity and specificity within the discovery set. The performance of  the panel will be measured in an independent set of specimens to determine sensitivity and  specificity, and identify potential CFS subgroups. We will determine whether individual  markers, or sets of markers, correlate with various clinical features of CFS. Infections with a variety of pathogens have been associated with the development of fatigue lasting  one year or longer, and post-infection fatigue patients typically meet clinical criteria for CFS.  Given the potential for heterogeneous infectious etiology, we hypothesize that CFS patients may  exhibit increased rates of seropositivity for a broad set of infectious agents associated with  fatigue. Using serum epitope repertoire analysis, we will determine whether IgG seropositivity for  20 infections (as a group) differs between CFS patients and controls. The proposed project may  identify antibody biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic immunoassay for CFS, and may  elucidate whether prior or ongoing infections are associated with CFS. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is a disabling condition  affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. The cause of CFS  remains unknown, and there are no objective laboratory diagnostic tests to  confirm disease. Consequently, diagnosis of CFS remains exceptionally difficult, requiring the  exclusion of a wide variety fatiguing illnesses. This project aims to apply advanced molecular  discovery tools and computation to identify patterns of circulating antibodies that can be   used to diagnose and monitor CFS patients using a blood test. This project also holds the  potential to associate prior infections with the development of CFS.",Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue

"High-Resolution Inference for Correlates of Vaccine Protection Project Summary/Abstract Statisticians play in a key role in quantifying the uncertainty in ﬁndings from clinical trials, observational studies, and other data sources, thereby enabling rational decision making based on the ﬁndings and protecting against the human tendency to see signal in noise. Ideally the validity of the uncertainty quantiﬁcation, also known as statistical inference, will be agnostic in the sense that it avoids reliance on implausible assumptions, thereby improving the interpretability and credibility of the resulting ﬁnd- ings. There has been much progress over the last several decades in obtaining agnostic inference of population-level quantities, such as (i) the percent reduction in infection in vaccinees compared to place- bos or (ii) the average treatment effect if the entire population receives treatment versus control. There has been relatively little progress, on the other hand, in obtaining agnostic inference of higher-resolution quantities, such as (i) the percent reduction in the probability of infection in vaccinees compared to place- bos, conditional on a continuous measure of immune response or (ii) the average treatment effect for an individual based on a high-dimensional set of observed covariates. These high-resolution quantities are function-valued in the sense that they are respectively deﬁned as functions of immune response and subject covariates. While inference for high-resolution quantities can be obtained when one is willing to commit to strong assumptions on the observed data distribution, these methods are plagued by the same deﬁciencies of poor interpretability and damaged credibility faced by non-agnostic inferential procedures for population-valued quantities. In contrast to the limited progress on obtaining inference for more reﬁned quantities, there has been considerable progress towards obtaining inference-free point estimates of (i) the percent reduction in infection probability conditional on immune response markers and (ii) the average treatment effect conditional on covariates. This progress has come from several ﬁelds, including statistics, machine learning, and computer science. This proposal outlines a uniﬁed methodology for obtaining inference for high-resolution quantities, where the proposal draws inspiration from a framework developed for population-level quantities, namely targeted minimum loss-based estimation, but features highly original developments that enable inference for higher-resolution, function-valued quantities. This work has the potential to make a major impact on the identiﬁcation of individual-level variables that correlate with vaccine efﬁcacy, including in identifying individuals who will be harmed by the only licensed dengue vaccine and in identify vaccine-induced immune responses that correlate with prevention in two ongoing HIV vaccine efﬁcacy trials. The potential for broad impacts to other areas of biomedical research, including precision medicine, are also described. Project Narrative The statistics and machine learning communities have made remarkable progress in developing highly ﬂexible data mining procedures that, for example, enable (i) the identiﬁcation of potentially protective vaccine-induced immune responses and (ii) the prediction of the optimal treatment for a given individual. Despite this progress, there has been little progress in quantifying the uncertainty in the output of these ﬂexible procedures without making implausible assumptions on the mechanism that generated the data, where the likely failure of these assumptions renders it difﬁcult to make (i) informed vaccine development decisions based on the identiﬁed immune response or (ii) treatment decisions based on the predicted optimal treatment. The proposed work develops a uniﬁed methodology for quantifying the uncertainty in estimates obtained using these data mining techniques, thereby enabling informed decision making.",High-Resolution Inference for Correlates of Vaccine Protection,9774603,DP2LM013340,"['Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Noise ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' human immunodeficiency virus vaccine ', ' HIV/AIDS Vaccines ', ' HIV vaccine ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Techniques ', ' vaccine development ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' computer science ', ' Prevention ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' learning community ', ' response biomarker ', ' response markers ', ' Dengue Vaccine ', ' Dengue virus vaccine ', ' DENV vaccine ', ' high dimensionality ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP2,2019,2332500,WA-07,0.03151027015392557
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9800752,R01AI146028,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antibody Affinity ', ' antigen antibody affinity ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Conversion ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' secondary immune response ', ' anamnestic reaction ', ' Immunological Memory ', ' Immune memory ', ' Immunologic Memory ', ' immuno therapy ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune drugs ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' immune receptor ', ' Immunological Receptors ', ' Immunologic Receptors ', ' Science ', ' Statistical Distributions ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Immunology ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Immunological Models ', ' Immunologic Model ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' immunotherapy of cancer ', ' immunotherapy for cancer ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Entropy ', ' Knowledge ', ' fighting ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' success ', ' functional group ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation ', ' somatic hypermutation ', ' Ig Somatic Hypermutation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Biochemical Process ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Update ', ' V(D)J Recombination ', ' VDJ recombination ', ' VDJ rearrangement ', ' V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' Immunoglobulin V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' deep sequencing ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' indel ', ' biochemical model ', ' markov model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' progenitor ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput DNA Sequencing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' T-cell receptor repertoire ', ' TCR repertoire ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,632498,WA-07,0.033213537895954964
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9654700,R01AI137681,"['Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Filtration Fractionation ', ' Filtration ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' IFN ', ' Interferons ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Moldova ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' mtb ', ' M.tuberculosis ', ' M.tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' National Health Programs ', ' Organizational Goals ', ' Organizational Objectives ', ' Patients ', ' Peptide Fragments ', ' Peptides ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' TB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' falls ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' immunological markers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' age group ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' treatment planning ', ' enzyme linked immunospot assay ', ' ELISPOT ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Sensitivity ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' nanodisk ', ' nano disk ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' high risk ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' biosignature ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' T cell response ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' blood-based marker ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' biomarker performance ', ' biomarker utility ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' random forest ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,715056,CA-52,0.10417198336790782
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9675217,U01AI131344,"['Allergens ', ' Animals ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibodies ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Bacteria ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' cow ', ' bovine ', ' bovid ', ' Bovine Species ', ' Cattle ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' eczematous ', ' Eczematous Dermatitis ', ' Eczema ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Allergy ', ' Food Hypersensitivity ', ' Future ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' IgA ', ' Immunoglobulin A ', ' Secretory IgA ', ' SIgA ', ' Exocrine IgA ', ' Secretory Immunoglobulin A ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immune Globulins ', ' Immunoglobulins ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Milk ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' plasmocyte ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' B-Cell Subsets ', ' B-Lymphocyte Subsets ', ' Measures ', ' Immunology ', ' Extrinsic asthma ', ' extrinsic allergic asthma ', ' atopic asthma ', ' Allergic asthma ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Infant Development ', ' Immunoglobulin Class Switching ', ' Isotype Switchings ', ' Isotype Switching ', ' Immunoglobulin Class Switchings ', ' Class Switchings ', ' Class Switching ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Mucosal Immunity ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' atopy ', ' atopic triad ', ' Atopic Allergy ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' postnatal ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Farming environment ', ' farm environment ', ' Farm ', ' Allergy to peanuts ', ' peanut allergy ', ' allergic to peanuts ', ' Peanut Hypersensitivity ', ' Groundnut Hypersensitivity ', ' Mennonite ', ' animal data ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' microbial ', ' Memory B-Lymphocyte ', ' Memory B Cell ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Sorting -

"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9647931,R21AI143399,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Anaphylaxis ', ' Anaphylactic Shock ', ' Anaphylactic Reaction ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Epitopes ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' anti-virals ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' Antivirals ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hybridomas ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' In Vitro ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers.

"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB

"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes.

"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9663912,U54CA225088,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Archives ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Communication ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Genotype ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' immuno therapy ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune drugs ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Logic ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Newsletter ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Students ', ' regulatory T-cells ', ' Treg ', ' Regulatory T-Lymphocyte ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well.

"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology.

"Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  Knowledge from the recent clinical trials suggests that over 80% of head and neck cancer (HNC) are hypo-immunogenic cold tumors and non-responsive to immune checkpoint receptors (ICR) blockade. With the emerging combinatorial strategies for cold cancer, precise identification of this group of tumors is essential for the selection of optimal treatment protocols. However, there is no consistent algorithm available to assess the global immune profile of HNC. Most of the current immunoscore methods are based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a limited panel of biomarkers, which prevents a precise annotation of the landscape of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The IHC method is technically sensitive, and may present inter-institutional and inter-pathologists variations. Moreover, the current immunoscore only emphasizes on a few T-cell subsets, and does not integrate cancer genomic features that modulate tumor response to immune killing. In fact, strong evidence suggests that the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway plays a fundamental role in HNC response to effector immune cells. Thus, leveraging global TIL profiles and cancer genomic features offers an unprecedented opportunity to classify HNC based on its immunogenicity. The current robust methods for cellular deconvolution are sensitive to outliers, which are frequently observed in the whole tumor RNA-Seq datasets. Our recent studies show that a novel machine learning tool Fast And Robust DEconcolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), which adaptively detects and removes outliers, exhibits superior accuracy in immune cell deconvolution. In precise alignment with the FOA, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that a compound immunoscore integrating FARDEEP-assisted TIL deconvolution and cancer genomics can effectively identify cold HNC. To achieve this goal, our two immediate next steps are: **(1) We will develop a robust model-free approach to identify TIL-driving oncogenic pathways; **(2) We will construct a compound immunoscore integrating cancer genomic features and TIL profiles to identify cold HNC. These studies will develop a novel “statistical methodology appropriate for analyzing genome-wide data” and provide “statistical analysis of existing genome-wide data” for an NIDCR priority disease. This project will refine a robust and novel immune-cell deconvolution machine learning tool and characterize central oncogenic pathways that shift the TIL landscape. The new immunogenomics algorithms will streamline the immunoscoring method to effectively stratify HNC and contribute to the precision selection of combinatorial treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The immune microenvironment holds strong potential to complement the current head and neck cancer (HNC) staging system for more effective patient stratification. But the current immunoscores, which depict the infiltration of some subsets of T cells, are limited by the number of evaluated immune-cell subsets and exclusion of biomarkers for cancer sensitivity to immune killing. In this project, we will refine our unique robust methods to integrate global tumor-infiltrating immune cells with cancer genomics, constructing a compound immunoscore for the precise identification of hypo-immunogenic HNC.",Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer,9766266,R03DE027399,"['Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Interferon Type I ', ' lFN-Gamma ', ' Interferon-gamma ', ' Interferon Gamma ', ' Immune Interferon ', ' IFNγ ', ' IFNG ', ' IFN-γ ', ' IFN-g ', ' IFN-Gamma ', ' Gamma interferon ', ' Interferon Type II ', ' IFN ', ' Interferons ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Weight ', ' Lymphocyte Subpopulations ', ' Lymphocyte Subset ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cell Subsets ', ' T-Lymphocyte Subsets ', ' Group Identifications ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Glean ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' prognostic ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Infiltration ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Cancer Vaccines ', ' vaccine for cancer ', ' Tumor Vaccines ', ' Neoplasm Vaccines ', ' Antineoplastic Vaccine ', ' chemoradiation ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Clinic ', ' Staging System ', ' Techniques ', ' receptor expression ', ' novel ', ' Exclusion ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' immunogenic ', ' SCCHN ', ' Head and Neck Carcinoma ', ' HNSCC ', ' Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Receptor Inhibition ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cancer genomics ', ' oncogenomics ', ' immunogenicity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Oncogenic ', ' combinatorial ', ' tumor ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' inter-institutional ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' prognostic performance ', ' immune checkpoint ', ' immunecheckpoint ', ' immune check point ', ' recruit ', ' checkpoint receptors ', ' check point receptors ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Tumor-infiltrating immune cells ', ' T cell tumor trafficking ', ' T cell infiltration ', ' Immune infiltrates ', ' Immunogenomics ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2019,161997,MI-12,0.0032406969242005793
"Comprehensive Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy Response Project Summary  Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) immunotherapies can result in robust and durable disease control in many advanced malignancies, and their use is transforming cancer care. Despite the growing adoption, however, ICIs are effective in <30% of patients and can cause significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in up to ~60% of treated patients. Early determination of which patient will respond and/or develop irAEs remains a great challenge due to the complex interplay of tumor response, toxicity in critical organs, and overall patterns of immune activation. Further complicating their use, ICI costs are high ($100k-$250k annually/patient; total Medicare Part B payment for ICIs in 2018 >$4 billion). A comprehensive assessment of early ICI therapeutic response and toxicity would provide oncologists with timely, actionable information to better balance benefits and risks, improve patient outcomes, reduce toxicities and lower healthcare costs.  Molecular imaging is an invaluable tool for assessing spatial and temporal changes in tumors, damage to critical organs and immune activation during immunotherapies. Unfortunately, current assessments require manually evaluating a subset of disease sites, which is both laborious and subjective. Immunotherapies’ unique mechanism of action often gives rise to novel imaging patterns of tumor response (e.g. pseudoprogression) that cannot be easily resolved by current methods. Disease response, organ toxicity, and lymphoid tissue immune activation are interdependent. Information on all three of these aspects of response must be known to capture the complete landscape of immunotherapy response. The status quo in assessing response not only fails to fully extract clinically significant information from the imaging data, but also provides very limited information to medical oncologists for improved overall patient management. To address this unmet need, AIQ Solutions (Madison, WI) proposes to develop ImmunIQ , a software product that provides a comprehensive view of immunotherapy response. Specifically, ImmunIQ will automatically and simultaneously assess: (1) response of all tumor lesions, (2) immune-related toxicities in critical organs, and (3) immune activation. Upon successful completion of Phase I, we will have a functional software prototype. In Phase II, we will clinically validate the platform with outcome and irAE data and develop a prototype ready for commercialization and FDA 510(k) submission.

"Identifying immunotherapy targets against thymus B cells in AChR myasthenia gravis (MG) Project Summary Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder caused by autoantibodies that disrupt components of neuromuscular junctions, such as the acetylcholine receptor (AChR, 90% of patients). Rituximab (RTX) is a B cell depleting agent used in the management of an increasingly wide range of autoimmune diseases; many AChR MG patients achieve remission after RTX but relapse following treatment cessation is common. The thymus is a known reservoir of B cells that can produce pathogenic anti-AChR antibodies and resection of the thymus has long been known to improve MG symptoms; however, many patients also fail to achieve complete remission after thymectomy. In both cases, we conclude that the failed depletion of B cells relevant to disease may be driving poor responses. Developing systemic immunotherapy to better target B cells that escape depletion is therefore of critical importance for effective MG treatment. Characterizing the features of B cells that re-emerge after RTX depletion in MG would further the development of more effective treatments for MG and lead to a deeper understanding of the immuno-pathophysiology behind the disorder. The overall goal of this project is to characterize the transcriptional features of disease-relevant B cells from patients who experienced poor outcomes from two randomized clinical trials on the use of rituximab and thymectomy for the treatment of AChR MG. Our laboratory recently developed a method called single cell tracing of adaptive immune repertoires (STAIR) that allows for the unbiased identification and transcriptional characterization of autoantigen-specific B cells that escape RTX depletion by combining high-depth bulk repertoire sequencing methods with single cell gene expression and repertoire analysis. For this proposal, I will apply this approach to investigate the single cell gene expression characteristics of B cells from the thymus that persist in the circulation of patients who underwent thymectomy (Goal 1), and the characteristics of B cells associated with poor clinical responses to RTX (Goal 2). We will test the hypothesis that B cells shared with the thymus will have a similar single cell transcriptional identity as those that fail to be depleted by RTX: we expect that they will be clonally expanded IgG-switched ASCs with specificity for autoantigen. This fellowship integrates a training plan that will include invaluable learning experiences in machine learning and the latest NGS technology This training plan will enhance the applicant's goal of becoming a physician scientist at the interface of clinical medicine and science. Project Narrative: Rituximab (RTX) is a B cell depleting therapy approved for the treatment of an increasing number of autoimmune disorders; however, we observed that a significant fraction of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients relapsed despite early remission with RTX, a phenomenon observed in the context of other RTX-treated autoimmune disorders as well. This proposal will investigate the mechanism of relapse after B cell depleting therapy in MG by using novel single-cell tracing of adaptive immune repertoire (STAIR) analysis to study samples from two completed randomized clinical trials (BeatMG, MGTX). This experience will also provide invaluable computational and experimental training and new learning for the applicant.",Identifying immunotherapy targets against thymus B cells in AChR myasthenia gravis (MG),10068690,F31AI154799,"['Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Autoantigens ', ' Autologous Antigens ', ' Self-Antigens ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biological Products ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Biological Agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clone Cells ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fellowship ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Neuromuscular Junction ', ' Myoneural Junction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell ', ' B cell receptor ', ' Cholinergic Receptors ', ' ACh Receptors ', ' Acetylcholine Receptors ', ' Cholinoceptive Sites ', ' Cholinoceptors ', ' Fc Receptor ', ' antibody receptor ', ' Nicotinic Receptors ', ' Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thymectomy ', ' Thymus Gland ', ' Thymus ', ' Thymus Proper ', ' Thymus Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' B-Lymphocyte Subsets ', ' B-Cell Subsets ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Antibody-Secreting Cells ', ' Immunoglobulin-Secreting Cells ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' C2B8 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MabThera ', ' Rituxan ', ' rituximab ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Autoimmune ', ' Autoimmune Process ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Memory B Cell ', ' Memory B-Lymphocyte ', ' Modality ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' response ', ' cessation of treatment ', ' treatment cessation ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Recombinant Antibody ', ' Symptoms ', ' Resolution ', ' SYS-TX ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neuromuscular ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' relapse patients ', ' ']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,30330,CT-03,0.024352866426803146
"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement into

"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and

"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next

"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform. Project Narrative We will compile existing TB gene expression data and develop a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease.

"Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution Project Summary/Abstract It is hard to overstate the importance of monoclonal antibodies in the life sciences. Antibodies are critical tools in biomedical research and diagnostics (e.g. western blotting, immunoprecipitation, cytometry, biomarker discovery, and histology), are one of the most rapidly growing class of therapeutics, and are the basis for myriad new strategies in cancer therapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors that are revolutionizing treatment. Unfortunately, current methods for the generation of custom antibodies, including animal immunization and phage display, are slow, costly, inaccessible to most researchers, and often unsuccessful. We propose Autonomously EvolvinG Yeast-displayed antibodieS (AEGYS), a system for the continuous and rapid evolution of high-quality antibodies against custom antigens that requires only the simple culturing of yeast cells. We believe this can be achieved by combining cutting-edge generative machine learning algorithms for antibody library design with a new technology for in vivo continuous evolution and a yeast antigen-presenting cell that we will engineer. If successful, AEGYS should have a transformative impact across the whole of biomedicine by turning monoclonal antibody generation into a rapid, scalable, and accessible process where any lab with standard molecular biology capabilities can generate custom antibodies on demand simply by “immunizing” a test tube of yeast cells with an antigen. We anticipate that this democratization of antibody generation will also result in an explosion of crowdsourced antibody sequence data that will train our machine learning algorithms to design better antibody libraries for AEGYS, starting a virtuous cycle. We ourselves will use AEGYS to generate a panel of subtype- and conformation-specific nanobodies against biogenic amine receptors including those that respond to acetylcholine, adrenaline, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters, so that we can understand their role in neurobiology and addiction.! Project Narrative This proposal will provide a system for the scalable continuous evolution and computational design of antibodies against user-selected antigens. Antibodies are critical tools in medical research and are the basis for numerous therapies, but the generation of custom antibodies against new targets is a difficult and specialized task. The system proposed will turn antibody generation into a routine and widely accessible process for researchers in almost any field.","Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution",10021311,R01CA260415,"['Acetylcholine ', ' Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Antibody Affinity ', ' antigen antibody affinity ', ' Antibody Formation ', ' Ab response ', ' Antibody Production ', ' antibody biosynthesis ', ' immunoglobulin biosynthesis ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Detergents ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Evolution ', ' Explosion ', ' Genes ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybridomas ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunoglobulin Fragments ', ' Antibody Fragments ', ' Immunoprecipitation ', ' Immune Precipitation ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nobel Prize ', ' Pheromone ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Production ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Reagent ', ' Cell Surface Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Medical Research ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biogenic Amine Receptors ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' directed evolution ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' structural biology ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Proteome ', ' Cytometry ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' antigen bound ', ' antigen binding ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Therapy Research ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' in vivo ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Collection ', ' Phage Display ', ' Update ', ' Immunoglobulin V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' VDJ rearrangement ', ' VDJ recombination ', ' V(D)J Recombination ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' decision research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' antibody engineering ', ' nanobody ', ' sdAb ', ' single domain antibodies ', ' nanobodies ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' antibody libraries ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Checkpoint inhibitor ', ' immune check point inhibitor ', ' Immune checkpoint inhibitor ', ' Immunize ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2020,1690552,CA-45,0.07353244428974776
"Targeting the Immune Onco-GPCRome  as a Novel Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy Strategy ABSTRACT Recent advances in checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) inhibiting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the limited response rates in most cancers suggest that new approaches and targets are clearly needed to fully elucidate the underlying biology of dysfunctional and exhausted CD8 T cells in cancer and achieve durable responses (cure). G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most intensively studied drug targets since they play key roles in many physiological processes, and they have remained longstanding favorable pharmacological targets. Here, we plan to first use novel computational approaches analyzing multiple single cell RNAseq databases to deconvolute T cell heterogeneity in order to generate a transcriptomic GPCR signature for tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary data shows an upregulation of prostaglandin receptors, EP2 and EP4, on exhausted T cells, suggesting that these GPCRs that are coupled to the G protein Gs, and their downstream signaling cascades may be dampening anti-tumor cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, leading to exhaustion. We hypothesize that activation of EP2 and EP4 on CD8 T cells and the subsequent Gs signaling leads to decreased cytotoxic and migratory activity that nullifies the effectiveness of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade. Put together, EP2 and EP4 may represent promising candidates as immune checkpoints that can be targeted in combination with CBI as part of novel multimodality precision immunotherapy approach to reactivate the immune system to destroy tumors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have led to major treatment breakthroughs for a number of different cancers, but the majority of the cancer patients do not respond to immunotherapies, and clinical responses are often not durable. The research outlined in this proposal will illuminate the roles of G protein coupled receptors on immune cells in cancer that may lead to the identification of novel targets that need to be blocked in combination with current immunotherapies to achieve complete responses (cure).",Targeting the Immune Onco-GPCRome  as a Novel Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy Strategy,9992888,F31CA250488,"['Cyclic

"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses.

"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,9953139,K23HL151892,"['Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Critical Care ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Immunity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxin ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Intercrines ', ' SIS cytokines ', ' chemoattractant cytokine ', ' chemokine ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Systemic disease ', ' protein profiling ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' protein complex ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Immune Targeting ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mononuclear ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Transcript ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' IMiD ', ' Immune modulatory therapeutic ', ' immune modulating agents ', ' immune modulating drug ', ' immune modulating therapeutics ', ' immune modulators ', ' immune modulatory agents ', ' immune modulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulating agents ', ' immunomodulatory agents ', ' immunomodulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulatory therapeutics ', ' Immunomodulators ', ' pulmonary artery hypertension ', ' pulmonary arterial hypertension ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genetic profiling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' therapeutic target ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' Growth Agents ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Growth Factor ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' public repository ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,CA-18,0.043879285317495
"Mapping and dissecting the role of antibodies in Mtb control While a quarter of the world carries the burden of tuberculosis, emerging data suggests that those coinfected with HIV are at an elevated risk of reactivating the disease. However, the specific immunological perturbations that lead to loss of Tb control are poorly understood. One critical risk factor associated with HIV coinfection is the depletion of CD4 T cells, which has been linked to increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) uptake into macrophages and diminished granuloma integrity. However, even with the restoration of CD4 T cells with HAART, Mtb/HIV co-infected individuals continue to exhibit a higher risk of Mtb reactivation. However, CD4+ T cell loss/perturbations may also contribute to loss of Mtb containment through indirect mechanisms such as the loss of the requisite help to B cells required for the production of highly functional antibodies. Along these lines, mounting data point to an enrichment of anti-microbial antibody responses among latently infected individuals, able to contain bacterial growth in vitro and even control bacteria in vivo when transferred to mice prior to challenge. Thus, given our emerging appreciation for a role for antibodies in Mtb-control/killing, here we propose to use a systems serology profiling approach, to begin to define the specificities and functions of antibodies that contribute to longitudinal control of Mtb in both HIV uninfected and infected populations. Moreover, linked to B cell cloning, Fc-engineering, and in vitro/in vivo models, we also seek to divorce humoral biomarkers of Mtb control from mechanistic roles of antibodies in preventing progression to TB. Collectively, these data will provide novel insights into the potential humoral profiles that if harnessed via vaccination or through therapeutics may lead to enhanced control of Mtb. This proposal aims to define the specificities, functional profiles, and anti-microbial mechanism(s) of antibodies that prevent progression to TB.",Mapping and dissecting the role of antibodies in Mtb control,10234399,R56AI155149,"['Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Antibody Specificity ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Clone Cells ', ' Cloning ', ' Containment ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Divorce ', ' Divorced state ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Grant ', ' Granuloma ', ' Granulomatous Lesion ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Cellular Immunity ', ' Cell Mediated Immunology ', ' Cell-Mediated Immunity ', ' Humoral Immunities ', ' antibody-based immunity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' macrophage ', ' Maps ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Fc Receptor ', ' antibody receptor ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Serological Tests ', ' serology ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 helper T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' Time ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Vaccination ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' uptake ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' HAART ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunologics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' new vaccines ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' novel vaccines ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' coinfection ', ' co-infection ', ' Antibody Response ', ' HIV/Mtb ', ' HIV/mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' HIV/tuberculosis ', ' M. tuberculosis/HIV ', ' HIV/TB ', ' ']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2020,815165,MA-08,0.025095603216731658
"Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis HIV-associated immunosuppression portends high risk for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Despite progress that has increased HIV testing and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in resource-limited settings, the incidence and mortality of CM remain very high. In addition, ART can elicit immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS), and CM also occurs in HIV- persons, including recipients of solid organ transplants and biologics. There are no host biomarkers to predict which HIV-infected (HIV+) patients will develop CM or C- IRIS. We are interested in the role antibody (Ab) immunity may play in resistance to CM, which is rare in people with intact immunity. We have contributed significant knowledge in this area, including recent data showing lower natural Laminarin (a β-glucan)-binding Ab levels in HIV+ patients with C-IRIS and positive serum cryptococcal antigen tests. Studies of HIV+ and HIV- patients revealed perturbations in Ab repertoires of patients with CM and C-IRIS, and lower IgM memory B cell levels in patients with CM. In mice, IgM memory homologs, B-1 cells and/or naïve IgM enhanced resistance to CM. These cells make Abs that bind microbial carbohydrates, e.g. the β-glucans on the Cn cell wall. The goal of this project is to probe the link between natural Ab and B cell responses to Cn and resistance to CM. We hypothesize CM risk will associate with deficiency of specific Cn- and/or β-glucan-binding Abs, stemming from B cell repertoire pertubations. Our aims are 1] To characterize Cn- and β-glucan-binding Abs of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, isolate monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) from normal persons and test their efficacy in mouse models. 2] To determine the ability of huMabs and GXM- and β-glucan-binding Abs to 1] exert direct effects on Cn viability and biology, and/or 2] mediate human effector cell Cn phagocytosis and/or killing. 3] To analyze B cell subsets, VH/VL repertoires, and transcriptional pathways of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, and controls, and use statistical modeling to identify signatures of CM risk. Knowledge gained from this project will inform tools to predict CM and C-IRIS risk, overcome roadblocks to diagnosis and therapy, provide new insight into the pathogenesis of CM, and inform development of immunotherapy and vaccines. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes a devastating form of meningitis that occurs most commonly in HIV-infected patients with profound T cell deficiency, but also occurs in patients with organ transplants, on biologics, and people with no apparent immune deficiency. Although anti-retroviral therapy has reduced the risk of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in resourced areas, CM continues to ravage HIV-infected patients in Africa, Asia and other areas, even with increased availability of anti-retroviral and anti-fungal therapy. The 6- month survival of CM in resource-limited settings is 45-55%. This is worse than glioblastoma multiforme (66% 2-year survival). At present, there is no way to identify patients who will develop cryptococcosis. The goal of this application is to identify a risk profile to help determine which patients are at risk for CM. This will have a significant impact on prevention, diagnosis, and care of patients with CM and be a major public and global health advance.","Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human

"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9984421,R35GM124922,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Connecticut ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Immune Markers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immunological markers ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immunologist ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' healthy aging ', ' combat ', ' learning network ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' immune system health ', ' immune health ', ' NGS data ', ' next generation sequence data ', ' informatics tool ', ' data diversity ', ' diverse data ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,464920,ME-02,0.013727627449563238
"Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, resulting in dramatic anti-tumor responses in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% show any survival benefit, and of these it is not clear what predicts response. ICIs have been thought to work primarily through reactivation of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8s) residing within the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Recent work, however, indicates that various CD4+ T cell populations outside the tumor microenvironment (peripheral immune system) likely play critical roles in carrying out anti-tumor immune responses. Given increasing evidence that immune cells other than CD8s are important for anti-tumor immunity, it is critical to identify and characterize these cells in order to understand their roles during HNSCC tumorigenesis and ICI therapy, which are currently unknown. This proposal by Dr. Kyle Jones, DDS, PhD seeks to significantly advance our understanding of cancer immunology in the context of HNSCC tumors, with the ultimate goal of improving existing ICI therapies and developing new treatment strategies. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, he will use a novel systems biology approach to accomplish the following Aims: (AIM 1) Quantify the effects that HNSCC tumors have on systemic immunity and determine if these changes are conserved across tumor, blood, and regional lymph nodes; (AIM 2) Determine how the ICI atezolizumab alters the intratumoral and peripheral immune states of HNSCC patients and if these changes are associated with tumor response to therapy. These Aims will define how HNSCC tumors alter the composition and function of patients' immune systems at single cell and systems levels as well as identify/characterize the specific immune cells that contribute to anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones will use high throughput single-cell methods such as mass cytometry, multiplexed ion beam imaging, and single-cell RNAseq along with established analytic pipelines on HNSCC patient specimens obtained before and after ICI therapy. The innovation of this approach, which permits simultaneous study of all immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, will reveal how changes in any individual immune cell population affects the overall immune state. It will also be important for the discovery of additional immune cell populations and biomarkers associated with HNSCC anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones's long-term career goal is to become an expert, leader, and independent translational scientist in the fields of head and neck cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Through this K23 award, he will obtain the additional training in experimental immunology, single cell analysis methods, computer programming, advanced statistical methods, and career development he needs to successfully achieve this goal.

"Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in children, with an estimated 1 million children affected, and more than 200,000 deaths in children yearly due to TB. HIV coinfection has been estimated to contribute to more than 35% of TB-related deaths in children in Africa, making the collision of the HIV and TB epidemics one of the most lethal to date. Both HIV infection as well as HIV-exposure in utero, among HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, have been linked to higher risks for the development of TB among young children. Failures to prevent TB disease and devastation has been attributed to the lack of an effective vaccine as well as our inability to diagnose children under the age of 5 due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum and the paucibacillary nature of the disease in young children. Thus, an inexpensive biomarker-based diagnostic test tailored for pediatric TB using non-sputum samples that could be used at the point of care in resource-limited settings could profoundly improve TB treatment and prevent deaths in children, especially in those under 5 years of age. While Mtb-specific antibody titer-based diagnostics have performed poorly in the past, due to the inability of accurately distinguishing between active TB disease from latent TB infection (LTBI), recent data from our group has shown that Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation shifts significantly across disease states. Moreover, this antigen-specific antibody glycosylation approach reliably classifies individuals into active and latent disease states across HIV infection status, across geographies and can even distinguish recent Typhoid infection among children in endemic areas. Based on these observations, a simple binding-based assay was developed that can rapidly, sensitively, and specifically detect changes in Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation from a small sample volume offering an opportunity for the first time to develop an antigen-specific antibody glycosylation diagnostic for pediatric TB from a microliter-scale sample. Given that HIV+, HEU, or unexposed children may target distinct Mtb antigens, here we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team and program termed FASTER-Kids (Fc Antibody Signatures for TubERculosis in children) that will: 1) Define the landscape of Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation responses that distinguish children with TB, 2) Develop a point-of-care test that will rapidly capture these specific antibody responses and glycosylation changes from microliters of blood. Ultimately, this collaborative structure will enable the iterative improvement and development of this simple, rapid, inexpensive diagnostic to manage TB infection in young children. Based on accumulating data pointing to highly significant shifts in TB-specific antibody glycosylation across latent and active TB disease, the goal of this proposal is to develop an inexpensive, simple, reliable TB-specific antibody-based point-of-care diagnostic to manage TB disease in children under the age of 5.",Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children,9986268,R01AI152158,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Geography ', ' glycosylation ', ' Metabolic Glycosylation ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Serological Tests ', ' serology ', ' South Africa ', ' Specificity ', ' Sputum ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Pulmonary Tuberculosis ', ' Lung TB ', ' Lung Tuberculosis ', ' Pulmonary TB ', ' Typhoid Fever ', ' Abdominal Typhus ', ' Enteric Fever ', ' Typhoid ', ' Vaccines ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' pediatrician ', ' Measurement ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' antibody titering ', ' Antibody titer measurement ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' response ', ' miniaturize ', ' microchip ', ' Drops ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Scheme ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' TB therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' coinfection ', ' co-infection ', ' Antibody Response ', ' HIV/Mtb ', ' HIV/mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' HIV/tuberculosis ', ' M. tuberculosis/HIV ', ' HIV/TB ', ' ']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,974009,MA-08,0.02965649682019298
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB).

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism.

"Designing neutralization antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 Project Summary COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic whose rapid spread and mortality rate threatens millions of lives and the global economic system. Developing effective treatment such as neutralization antibodies is an urgent need. We propose here to develop a new method to design antibodies strongly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) that is necessary for viral entrance to human cells. We will develop a novel approach that combines directed evolution, deep sequencing and interpretable neural network models to efficiently identify strong and specific antibodies. This method will allow analyzing large sequencing data sets of antibody variants against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in order to derive superior binders that do not exist in the original library. Iteration through directed evolution and computational design will efficiently identify neutralization antibody candidates that can be used as potent therapeutics to treat COVID-19.

"Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Infection and Illness The new coronavirus outbreak that begin in December 2019 has created a global public health emergency. This has led to an intense search to identify factors that contribute to the susceptibility and severity of illness. We recently developed an array to identify antibody-binding epitopes for rhinoviruses. Data from these arrays can be combined with information about viral protein structure to identify highly immunogenic regions for respiratory viruses. We propose to expand this array to include linear epitopes that represent the entire proteome of SARS- CoV-2 and all other common coronaviruses that infect humans (OC43, NL63, etc.). The study population will include children from the COAST, WISC and URECA birth cohort studies who are also participating in the HEROS SARS-CoV-2 surveillance study. As part of routine cohort activities, these children undergo serial sampling of blood and nasal secretions that we can analyze using the array to determine individual patterns of antiviral antibody epitope recognition. We hypothesize that the pattern and quantity of antibody specific for epitopes of common coronaviruses contributes to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. We propose three specific aims that will utilize sera obtained from children before and after HEROS-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. First, in specimens obtained pre-infection we will use the array to identify patterns of antibody epitope recognition to common childhood coronaviruses, assess cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, and determine whether cross-reactivity is associated with protection against infection or illness. In the second aim, we will determine whether the diversity of antibody responses to common respiratory viruses is associated with a reduced risk of infection or illness. Finally, in the third aim we will describe antibody binding patterns before and after known COVID-19 cases to identify candidate regions that are immunogenic and neutralizing. To accomplish this aim, we will perform micro-neutralization assays (available in the BSL3 laboratory of Dr. Kristen Bernard, UW Madison) on convalescent sera or nasal secretions from children who developed symptomatic infection. This information will be analyzed together with pre- and post-infection array data using machine learning approaches to identify neutralizing epitopes. Identifying patterns of serologic responses that are cross- protective could help to identify susceptible individuals in the population and direct the design of vaccines to current and future viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE (from parent grant) The morbidity and cost to society from childhood viral respiratory illnesses (VRI) is staggering, and allergic respiratory disease is rampant. In the search for prevention for these common and high-burden diseases, perhaps the solutions are on the farm. Our main hypothesis is that microbes in farming environments promote immune development in early life, and thereby reduce the severity of VRI and protect against allergies. We will test this hypothesis by expanding studies in the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC), a birth cohort in dairy farm country consisting of children and their families who were enrolled before birth and then monitored for farm exposures, development of the immune system, respiratory illnesses and allergies. We hope to identify farm-related exposures, including microbes, that promote healthy immune development, and ultimately, healthy children. Completion of these studies will lead to development of new strategies for raising children who get fewer respiratory illnesses and avoid developing respiratory allergies.",Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity,10170660,U19AI104317,"['Antibodies ', ' Viral Antibodies ', ' anti-viral antibody ', ' antiviral antibody ', ' Antibody Diversity ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Rhinovirus ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Viral Structural Proteins ', ' Virus ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Coronaviridae ', ' corona virus ', ' Coronavirus ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' B-Cell Epitopes ', ' B-Lymphocyte Epitopes ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' respiratory ', ' Farm ', ' farm environment ', ' Farming environment ', ' respiratory virus ', ' cohort ', ' PBMC ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' Allergic ', ' Proteome ', ' response ', ' cross reactivity ', ' immunogenic ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Common Epitope ', ' Population ', ' Microbe ', ' B cell repertoire ', ' parent grant ', ' public health emergency ', ' surveillance study ', ' Antibody Response ', ' study population ', ' infection risk ', ' CoV emergence ', ' coronavirus emergence ', ' emergent CoV ', ' emergent coronavirus ', ' emerging CoV ', ' emerging coronavirus ', ' nCoV ', ' new CoV ', ' new coronavirus ', ' novel CoV ', ' novel coronavirus ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U19,2020,406048,WI-02,-0.012363667955215618
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection.

"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10050030,R01AI148747,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Charge ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Statistical Study ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' flu immunisation ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' vaccination against influenza ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' TcR Genes ', ' T-Cell Receptor Genes ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Speed ', ' immunological diversity ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Protein Motifs ', ' Amino Acid Motifs ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' information model ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical properties ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,535171,MA-07,0.004827019768994961
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10026284,UH2AI153016,"['Affect ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Cytomegalovirus Infections ', ' CMV infection ', ' Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease ', ' Inclusion Disease ', ' Salivary Gland Virus Disease ', ' Cytomegalovirus ', ' CMV ', ' HCMV ', ' HHV 5 ', ' HHV5 ', ' Human Herpesvirus 5 ', ' Salivary Gland Viruses ', ' cytomegalovirus group ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dengue ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Hepatitis ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' infection with HBV ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' Herpesviridae ', ' Herpesviruses ', ' herpes virus ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' flu infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' flu vaccine ', ' flu virus vaccine ', ' vaccine against flu ', ' vaccine against influenza ', ' Joints ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neutralization Tests ', ' antibody neutralization test ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Serological Tests ', ' serology ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' United States ', ' Vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' flu immunisation ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' vaccination against influenza ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' West Nile virus ', ' Egypt 101 virus ', ' WNV ', ' West Nile ', ' Yellow Fever ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Immunology ', ' improved ', ' Viral Latency ', ' Virus Latency ', ' Malarial Vaccines ', ' vaccines against malaria ', ' Malaria Vaccines ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Yellow Fever Vaccine ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Cytometry ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' CMV vaccine ', ' Cytomegalovirus Vaccines ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Validation ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' network models ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' vaccine response ', ' vaccination study ', ' vaccination trial ', ' vaccine study ', ' vaccine trial ', ' phenotypic data ', ' malaria-infected ', ' malarial infection ', ' malaria infection ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2020,242126,CA-12,0.010075259386909442
"Accurate prediction of neutralization capacity from deep mining of SARS-CoV-2 serology ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to establish an accurate and sensitive method for predicting the neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 of serum samples by deep mining of antibody profiles. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat with nearly seven million cases and 400K deaths. In the absence of effective vaccines and therapeutics, immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is a main mechanism of protection against SARS-CoV-2 (re)infection. Our recent studies of convalescent serum samples revealed that their levels of neutralization capacity vary greatly (over 100-fold) and only a small subset has high neutralization capacity. Because viral neutralization assays are inherently low throughput, it is unrealistic to apply it to a high-risk population such as hospital workers in a timely manner. Unfortunately, there is only moderate correlation between the neutralization capacity and the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels determined using standard ELISA. Clearly, we still do not understand what types of antibodies contribute to viral neutralization. Our overarching hypothesis to be tested in this project is that by examining the antibody profile in patient serum more deeply and quantitatively in terms of antigens, epitopes and antibody types, we will be able to identify quantitative predictive markers for viral neutralization. To this end, we will develop multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 serology that will enable us to deeply characterize the antibody profile. We will then develop a predictive algorithm by utilizing. We have assembled a team of experts with truly complementary skills in antibody characterization, virology and data mining. We have access to a large number of convalescent serum samples, which will enable us to critically validate our technology. We will expeditiously execute the following aims. (1) We will develop multiplex serology assay for SARS-CoV-2 that can profile up to 15 antibody-antigen interactions in a single reaction. The main technical innovation is the introduction of multi-dimensional flow cytometry. We will produce multiple antigens including Spike, receptor-binding domain and nucleocapsid protein, and their natural and designed variants. We will refine and validate the assay using a large panel of convalescent serum samples. (2) We will develop an improved viral neutralization assay to better quantify the neutralization capacity. (3) We will develop a predictive algorithm for neutralization capacity that utilizes the antibody profiles from our multiplex assay. This analysis will identify serology parameters that contribute to neutralization. The end products of this project will include a high-throughput serology assay that gives far- richer antibody profiles than the current standard accompanied with an accurate predictive algorithm. Together, this platform will help advance a fundamental understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the development of vaccines and therapeutics against this formidable pathogen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples of people exposed to the virus vary greatly, and current antibody testing methods do not accurately determine the level of neutralizing antibodies. This project will develop innovative platform for deep mining of antibody profiles from a small amount of blood samples and accurately predict their neutralization capacity.

"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test.

"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic

"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community.

"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer. The proposal will allow for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis. The proposal will also improve understanding of the pathogenesis of this new disease entity.",Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,9998774,K23AR075872,"['outcome

"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9912094,R01AI135115,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cholera ', ' Cholera Vaccine ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Haiti ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sanitation ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vibrio cholerae ', ' V cholerae ', ' V. cholerae ', ' Vibrio comma ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Logistics ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' V cholerae O1 ', ' V cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V. cholerae O1 ', ' V. cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae O1 ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' fighting ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunologics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Haitian ', ' Bangladeshi ', ' Infection with V cholerae ', ' Infection with V. cholerae ', ' Infection with Vibrio cholerae ', ' V cholerae infection ', ' V. cholerae infection ', ' cholera infection ', ' infected with cholera ', ' infection with cholera ', ' Vibrio cholerae infection ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' Infrastructure ', ' diarrheal illness ', ' diarrheal disease ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,667663,UT-02,0.06030854618587055
"A multifactorial pipeline to dissect combinatorial drug efficacy in Tuberculosis ABSTRACT The rapid spread of multi-drug resistance has created a great need for new combination therapies to treat a variety of conditions, including infectious diseases and cancer. In one pressing example, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (TB) affects about 500,000 people each year and novel drug regimens are sorely needed. However, identifying new regimens has been daunting in part due to the inability to prioritize among a very large number of possible drug combinations. To address this need, we have generated an experimentally grounded, machine learning algorithm, INDIGO-MTB, which predicts the synergy or antagonism of TB drug combinations with high accuracy. Here we propose to adapt INDIGO-MTB into a multifactorial pipeline to dissect combinatorial drug efficacy and drive preclinical regimen development for TB. We will build in and validate the ability to predict drug interactions under stressful environmental conditions that mimic TB infection, and extract molecular mechanisms of drug interactions. We will then combine synergy and efficacy measurements to create new regimen rankings, which we will validate both in vitro and in a mouse model of TB infection. Altogether, our work will establish a tool for rapid assessment of TB drug combinations and a framework for applying this approach to other conditions where new multidrug therapies are needed. NARRATIVE Tuberculosis is a massive public health problem, and new drug regimens are sorely needed.

"Methods to Test Lifestyle, Vaginal Microenvironment, and Genitourinary Symptoms across Menopause Transition Over 50% of postmenopausal women are affected by the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which includes vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and sexual dysfunction. Symptoms worsen if untreated and are associated with stress and depression. Estrogen decline in menopause is thought to lead to reduced glycogen accumulation in the vaginal epithelium and is associated with low vaginal Lactobacillus spp. levels in 50-80% of women. Lactobacillus spp. protect the urogenital tract from pathogens in part by producing lactic acid and for their anti-inflammatory properties, but whether lactobacilli are a marker for estrogen levels or play a functional role in GSM is unknown. Available treatments for vulvovaginal GSM symptoms have limitations. Some women are contraindicated for hormonal therapy or are concerned with side effects. Vaginal lubricants provide some relief, but they may be toxic to the vaginal epithelium, reduce lactobacilli, and raise urogenital infection risk. New therapies are needed. Vaginal microbiota are a plausible approach to treatment, however, probiotics alone have not proven effective. Vaginal microbiota co-vary with metabolite and immune profiles, and it is unknown how these molecular features relate to GSM. We hypothesize that core vaginal microenvironment biomarkers (VMB; e.g., microbial, metabolite, and immune profiles) reflect vaginal biological aging (V-BA) that is increased by menopause but may also be modifiable by other factors, such as lifestyle. Longitudinal studies are needed to identify core age-related VMB and determine how they relate to GSM. To accomplish this task, we will develop new statistical methods to combine complex longitudinal epidemiologic data with high- dimensional compositional data. We will leverage 2,301 archived cervicovaginal samples collected as part of a cohort of 812 women aged 35-60 years with visits every six months for two years (R01-CA123467). Specific Aims are to 1) quantify V-BA using VMB; 2) evaluate the longitudinal relationship between V-BA and GSM; 3) longitudinally assess the relationship of lifestyle factors on V-BA and VMB; 4) quantify longitudinal mediation by V-BA and VMB between lifestyle and GSM. Microbiota are already profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (R21-AI107224). Along with clinical, demographic, and behavioral surveys, we will 1) use cervical secretions and multiplexed bead-based immune-assays to quantify concentrations of 70 immune markers (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors); 2) profile metabolites from vaginal swabs (GC/LC-MS). This proposal is focused on developing and validating new statistical methods that refine and adapt modern structural modeling and microbiota compositional analyses. The novel statistical approaches will allow identification of vaginal microenvironment features which may lead to development of new and effective GSM treatments. These methods will also provide a new framework to handle missing data and confounding that has limited prior microbiome studies. Our team has the multidisciplinary expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology, aging, gynecology, genomics, microbiology, and immunology required for a new systems-biology approach to GSM. Over 50% of postmenopausal women report genitourinary symptoms which result in detriments to their quality of life. Changes in the normal and protective vaginal bacteria (termed vaginal microbiota) accelerate in menopause transition for some women and have been associated with a higher burden of urogenital symptoms; therefore, we aim to determine how vaginal bacterial, metabolite, and immune profiles relate to genitourinary symptoms over time in a large study. The public health impact is to identify molecular targets of intervention which will improve postmenopausal vaginal health and lengthen women's healthspan, a key NIA mission.","Methods to Test

"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in

"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB

"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10038668,K23HL153581,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' mortality ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Physicians ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Sputum ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Triage ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Pulmonary Tuberculosis ', ' Lung TB ', ' Lung Tuberculosis ', ' Pulmonary TB ', ' Uganda ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Funding ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Proteome ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' International ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' disease phenotype ', ' prospective ', ' Coupling ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' biosignature ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker panel ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' protein markers ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,209400,CA-12,0.03873726569701657
"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10080510,R44AI150060,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Bacterial Proteins ', ' Bacterial Gene Products ', ' Bacterial Gene Proteins ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Laboratory Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgM ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Musculoskeletal System ', ' locomotor system ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Paper ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Serological Tests ', ' serology ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' DBL Oncoprotein ', ' oncogene protein DBL ', ' p66 ', ' protein DBL ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Outer surface protein C ', ' ospC ', ' OspC protein ', ' Individual ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Disease Progression ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' Spottings ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' Speed ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' cross reactivity ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ImProv ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' CD61 ', ' CD61 Antigens ', ' GP IIIa ', ' GP3A ', ' GPIIIa ', ' ITGB3 ', ' Integrin Beta 3 ', ' Integrin beta3 ', ' Integrin β3 ', ' NAIT ', ' PTP gene ', ' Platelet Fibrinogen Receptor, Beta Subunit ', ' Platelet GPIIIa ', ' Platelet Glycoprotein IIIa ', ' Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIIa ', ' ITGB3 gene ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' multiplex detection ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' blind ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Microbe ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' relapsing fever borrelia ', ' DbpB ', ' decorin binding protein B ', ' prototype ', ' efficacy testing ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' biological systems ', ' screening ', ' B miyamotoi ', ' B. miyamotoi ', ' Borrelia miyamotoi ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2020,300000,NY-01,-0.01192257011922949
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR . NARRATIVE More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease. While the CDC conventional standard two-tier approach for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. We propose to develop an objective multiplex enzyme immunoassay that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens and build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity.",Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease.,10080461,R43AI155211,"['Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Laboratory Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoglobulin A ', ' IgA ', ' IgA1 ', ' IgA2 ', ' Immunoglobulin D ', ' IgD ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' IgG1 ', ' IgG2 ', ' IgG3 ', ' IgG4 ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgM ', ' Immunoglobulin Isotypes ', ' Immunoglobulins ', ' Immune Globulins ', ' Infection ', ' Iowa ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Patients ', ' Peptidoglycan ', ' Murein ', ' Proteins ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Immunodominant Antigens ', ' Enzyme Linked Immunoassay Immunologic ', ' Enzyme Immunoassay ', ' G(s), alpha Subunit ', ' G(s), α Subunit ', ' G(s)alpha ', ' G(s)α ', ' GTP-Binding Protein α Subunits, Gs ', ' Gs alpha Family G-Protein ', ' Gsα ', ' Gαs ', ' Regulatory Ns Protein ', ' Stimulatory Gs G-Protein ', ' alpha Subunit Stimulatory GTP-Binding Protein ', ' alpha-Gs ', ' α-Gs ', ' GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Outer surface protein C ', ' ospC ', ' OspC protein ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Visual ', ' Licensing ', ' Arthritis in Lyme disease ', ' Lyme Arthritis ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' antigen bound ', ' antigen binding ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostic Specificity ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Reproducibility ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Update ', ' Immunoglobulin V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' VDJ rearrangement ', ' VDJ recombination ', ' V(D)J Recombination ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathogen ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' commercialization ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' erythema migrans ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Antibody Response ', ' ']",NIAID,"IMMUNO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2020,298123,TN-09,0.057659064118329585
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control. EBV causes a range of human diseases including infectious mononucleosis and several forms of cancer; however, limited EBV treatment options are available and no approved preventive EBV vaccines exist. Our long-term objective is to apply enhanced understanding of adaptive immunity to accelerate the rational development of new vaccines and therapeutics.",Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,9862588,R01HD100542,"['Antibodies ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bifidobacterium ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological

"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.

"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks. A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings. Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.  The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross- talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population- level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements) in each group.  This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the long-term impact of our findings. Throughout the proposal, a major area of focus is the development of visualization and model-reduction strategies that lay the foundation for interpretation of complex models. The machine learning algorithms developed will be readily applicable to a broad range of multiomics and multicohort studies and will be available as open-source software. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent technological advances have enabled the production of large immune monitoring datasets, providing an opportunity for systems-level efforts to harness the power of the immune system in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. In this project, we will develop machine learning algorithms for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell level, in a multiomics setting integrated with various other biological measurements, and subject to adjustments based on population-level factors. This work will provide a strong quantitative bridge between large-scale epidemiologic trends and deep biological profiling to investigate the complex mechanisms that govern the immune system in clinical settings.",Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings,10028766,R35GM138353,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Laboratories ', ' Immunologic Monitoring ', ' Immune Monitoring ', ' Immunological Monitoring ', ' Immunomonitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' Immunologic Model ', ' Immunological Models ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Medical History ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' microbiome ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' patient population ', ' biological systems ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' genome analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' metabonome ', ' metabolome ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,382710,CA-18,0.11020194118262867
"Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19 Since 2002, several coronaviruses have emerged able to cause severe respiratory disease, however no vaccine is available to prevent these rapidly spreading pathogens. Vaccine design has specifically lagged due to our lack of understanding of the correlates of immunity against these pathogens. Both cellular and humoral immune responses have been implicated in resolution of disease, but to date only the passive transfer of antibodies has been shown to confer complete protection in mice. Interestingly, the transfer of both “neutralizing” and non- neutralizing antibodies have shown protective efficacy, highlighting the role of multiple humoral mechanisms in limiting viral infection/spread. The precise mechanism of action of these antibodies that have the most profound impact on limiting disease is currently unclear, but if elucidated could provide critical insights for the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Thus, here we aim to take a systematic approach to dissect and define both the polyclonal and monoclonal mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against COVID-19. Specifically, samples from DNA- and adenovirus 26 (Ad26)- COVID-19 Spike protein (S) immunized animals, that will be challenged with COVID-19, will be comprehensively profiled using Systems Serology, to define the functional humoral immune responses linked to protection from infection/disease in mice, ferrets, and macaques. Machine learning modeling will be employed to discern key immune response features that translate usefully across these diverse animal contexts. Coupled to a novel systems-Fc-engineering approach, the COVID-19 CR3022 monoclonal antibody will be engineered to specifically define the Fc-effector functions that provide the greatest impact on limiting disease. Collectively, these studies will not only define correlates of immunity across vaccines and species, but also provide mechanistic insights into the precise mechanisms by which antibodies may confer protection in the context of future vaccines. This proposal seeks to define the humoral correlates and mechanisms of action against COVID-19 in mice, ferrets, and monkeys.",Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19,10126673,R37AI080289,"['Adenoviruses ', ' Adenoviridae ', ' Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement Activation ', ' complement pathway regulation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Ferrets ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Monkeys ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Phagocytosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Serological Tests ', ' serology ', ' Translating ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Coronaviridae ', ' corona virus ', ' Coronavirus ', ' Coronaviridae Infections ', ' Coronavirus Infections ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' mutant ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' vaccine development ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Passive Antibody Transfers ', ' Passive Transfer of Immunity ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immune modulation ', ' immune regulation ', ' immune regulator ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immunomodulatory ', ' immunoregulatory ', ' immunoregulation ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Neutrophil Recruitment ', ' Neutrophil Infiltration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' SARS ', ' SARS coronavirus disease ', ' SARS-CoV disease ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV disease ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus disease ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' antibody engineering ', ' protective efficacy ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Innate Immune System ', ' Immunize ', ' viral pathogen ', ' pathogenic virus ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' MERS ', ' MERS coronavirus disease ', ' MERS-CoV disease ', ' Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV disease ', ' Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus disease ', ' Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome ', ' Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome CoV disease ', ' Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus disease ', ' Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ', ' ']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R37,2020,391727,MA-08,0.07170191052451476
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,10004647,UH3EB025765,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Blood Substitutes ', ' Artificial Blood ', ' Artificial Erythrocytes ', ' Erythrocyte Substitutes ', ' Red Cell Substitutes ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Bone Diseases ', ' bone disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Dilated Cardiomyopathy ', ' Congestive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Doxorubicin ', ' 14-Hydroxydaunomycin ', ' Adriamycine ', ' Doxorubicina ', ' Hydroxyl Daunorubicin ', ' Hydroxyldaunorubicin ', ' Drug Evaluation ', ' Drug Evaluation Studies ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Endothelium ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Myopathy ', ' Muscle Disease ', ' Muscle Disorders ', ' Muscular Diseases ', ' Myopathic Conditions ', ' Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Myopathic disease or syndrome ', ' muscular disorder ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Protective Agents ', ' Protective Drugs ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk Factors ', ' skin disorder ', ' Cutaneous Disorder ', ' Dermatoses ', ' Skin Diseases ', ' Skin Diseases and Manifestations ', ' cutaneous disease ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Systemic disease ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' interstitial ', ' drug efficacy ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modality ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Early identification ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Skin ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' pre-clinical testing ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Validation ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' drug detection ', ' drug testing ', ' Network-based ', ' therapeutic target ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' circulating miRNA ', ' circulating miRNAs ', ' circulating microRNAs ', ' circulating microRNA ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' systemic toxicity ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' real time monitoring ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' medication safety ', ' complex data  ', ' ']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UH3,2020,1228168,NY-13,0.057820842897736466
"Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating autoimmune disease that is difficult to manage clinically, because it is characterized by unpredictable periods of remission and relapse. If the disease could be adequately monitored, it is possible drugs could intervene to prevent damage, reducing rates of relapse and overall progression. Ideally, it would be possible to repeatedly biopsy the CNS for monitoring, but this is too challenging/morbid to have utility. Herein, we propose an approach that harnesses tissue engineering principles to develop an immunological niche (IN) in vivo to enable harvest of physiologically relevant immune populations. The central hypothesis of this work is that INs can be created to reflect aspects of the innate and/or adaptive immune system that correlate with the CNS. Furthermore, we hypothesize that INs will provide a location into which a non-invasive optical sensor of multiple sclerosis can be implanted. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the FBR to implanted materials can be harnessed to create an IN reflective of innate immunity in the CNS and will dynamically monitor the formation of this niche. Scaffolds will be excised at appropriate time points during disease induction and analyzed with high-throughput gene expression arrays, scRNAseq, and machine learning to develop multivariate signatures capable of determining whether a mouse is diseased or healthy. Aim 2 (K99) will harness specific antigen-binding peptides to build noninvasive sensors for biomarkers of disease progression. Fluorophore-labeled peptides that specifically bind biomarkers of disease will be incorporated into PEG hydrogels which will be engineered such that the binding of the desired antigen will enable detection via FRET. These sensors will be incorporated into the pores of the IN to enable non-invasive monitoring of MS. Aim 3 (R00) will develop INs reflective of adaptive immune populations in the CNS, by incorporating antigens within the scaffolds. This section will create a non-invasive sensor and multivariate signature reflective of adaptive immune changes within the surrogates and harness both innate and adaptive INs to investigate mechanistic questions about innate-adaptive crosstalk in the development of MS. Taken together these studies will create engineered immunological niches and non-invasive sensors that enable the creation of enhanced diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitors, and longitudinal immunology studies without euthanasia.  This work is at the intersection of immunology and biomaterials and will require biomaterials synthesis, scRNAseq, computational analysis, tissue engineering, immunology, and biosensor design and validation. The applicant has significant experience in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and the host response, but requires further training in immunology, computational analysis, and biosensor design/validation. Both this award and the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise to begin his career as an independent investigator. Furthermore, this work will develop new diagnostics, new techniques useful to the field as a whole, and contribute to an understanding of unanswered questions in innate-adaptive crosstalk in autoimmunity. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune infiltrate into the CNS and subsequent damage to myelin, that is difficult to diagnose and monitor because the site for disease cannot be readily biopsied for analysis. The goal of this proposal is to create engineered immunological niches and corresponding non- invasive sensors that will correlate with the innate or adaptive immune responses during disease onset and progression by implanting engineered scaffolds in the subcutaneous space. The implications of this work are broad including diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitoring tools, and research tools to enable longitudinal isolation of disease-inducing cells or non-invasive protein measurements from a single host without euthanasia.",Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring,10054726,K99EB028840,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Animals ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Award ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis ', ' EAE ', ' Experimental Allergic Encephalitis ', ' Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis ', ' autoimmune encephalomyelitis ', ' Engineering ', ' Euthanasia ', ' Mercy Killing ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Foreign Bodies ', ' Future ', ' Gel ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Nonspecific Immunity ', ' Morbidity -
