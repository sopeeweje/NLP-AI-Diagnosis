"Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among the elderly, one of the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions, are a major health problem. Several studies have identified quantifiable gait markers that appear to distinguish between elderly ""fallers"" and non-fallers. These studies have relied on data acquired in gait-laboratories. Extending gait assessment capability, and falls detection, into the home could provide valuable before-the-fact information on gait weakness evolution, which in turn could be used to assess the efficiency of counter measures. Current mobile gait analysis techniques are insufficient because they rely on compliance or are too intrusive. The development of a new gait assessment and falls monitor is proposed. The device is passive and obtains gait data from sensing floor vibrations as well as a minimally invasive wireless device, precluding the need to walk on special surfaces or be observed by cameras. This study's principal aim is to validate the device's performance through a comparison with accepted gait assessment techniques at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gait lab at the University of Virginia Health System   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents. Fall-related injuries are among the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and are a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions. The cost of falls to the national economy is significant. In 1994 the total cost due to falls was estimated to be $20.2 billion. This number is expected to climb to $32.2 billion by 2020. One suggestion for reducing the number of falls has been the creation of a fall risk assessment for institutional residents, an important component of which is gait assessment. In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort, it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.           Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring Notice Number: NOT-OD-10-034) Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia.

"AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01): Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention, and specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Clinically significant depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 86% of nursing home residents [Brodaty01], with substantial under-recognition of the problem and excess morbidity and mortality in individuals with dementia. The sensitivity of current depression detection approaches deteriorates notably with progressive cognitive impairment due to: (i) diminishing ability of demented subjects to communicate affective states, (ii) critical overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression and the neuropsychiatric features of dementia (e.g., apathy), and (iii) the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms in the context of dementia [Bielinski06]. In order to improve the assessment of depression in dementia patients, the NIMH has proposed modifications to the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder that 1) highlight the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms, 2) addition of social withdrawal and irritability items, and 3) substitution of the anhedonia criterion with ""decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contact and usual activities"" [Olin02]. As the subject's ability to report internal affective states diminishes, however, activity and behavioral correlates of depression such as verbal and motor agitation, physical aggression, care resistance, and food/fluid refusal become important markers of possible depression [Bielinski06]. Emerging video, audio and sensor technologies hold promise for quantifying and automating the detection of such activities and behaviors, and thus identifying stages of depression that may be differentially responsive to various prevention and intervention strategies. We propose to overcome the under-diagnosis and failed recognition of symptoms of depression in dementia by applying real-time continuous video and audio recordings in the non-private spaces of a nursing home special care dementia unit (SCU; 16 total beds), as well as sensor recordings (radiofrequency identification tags, motion, contact and pressure sensors) throughout all the SCU spaces to capture the consenting subjects' activities, behaviors and social interaction patterns. Current ""gold standard"" research rating instruments will also be administered to record a detailed account of the cohort's clinical characteristics. The recordings will take place in three two-week waves that are each separated by 3 months. A frame-by-frame annotation of the video recordings by trained coders, as well as the pattern of sensor recordings, will provide training data for computer-based machine learning algorithms that will automate the detection of potential activity and behavioral manifestations to distinguish depressed from non-depressed nursing home residents with cognitive impairment or dementia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.           Research Narrative The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.",AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA,7937981,RC1MH090021,"['National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Staging ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' instrument ', ' Records ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Physical aggression ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' pleasure ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Agitation ', ' Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' diagnosis evaluation ', ' radiofrequency ', ' Accounting ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Affective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' Food ', ' Affect ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Measurement ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motion ', ' ']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,RC1,2010,454869,PA-18,0.020073910542978305
"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment.

The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Cognitive decline in aging arises when age-associated neuropathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand or adapt to those processes.

"Continuous Fall Risk Monitoring System: Walking vs Activities of Daily Living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to U.S. emergency departments and the primary etiology of accidental deaths in persons over the age of 65 years1. Interventions such as physical therapy, adjusting medications, or behavior changes can reduce the elderly fall rate2. Fall risk determination is needed to identify who may benefit from interventions. Changes in fall risk may occur suddenly or gradually, and are more likely to become apparent in the home environment as an individual goes about their normal activities of daily living (ADLs) rather than during a limited and periodic care provider assessment. Consequently, a continuous, all-in-one system that would monitor elderly individuals in the home for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls is needed to reduce falls in the elderly. To be effective, the monitoring device must be non-intrusive and socially acceptable. The long-term goal of this project is to [extend an existing non-intrusive, commercially available monitoring system capable of location tracking, physiologic monitoring, and alerting to also assess fall risk in real time; the system would consider factors such as frequent bathroom use, fitful sleep and changes in gait characteristics]. The monitor for the proposed research has a watch form factor, is worn at the wrist, and has demonstrated high acceptance rates by elderly users. Research has shown that abnormal gait is indicative of fall risk, leading to the use of a variety of measurements of gait in fall risk determinations. To analyze gait from data gathered during ADLs, it is necessary to differentiate periods of walking, which can then be analyzed for abnormal characteristics. The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to test the [feasibility of using tri-axial acceleration data gathered from a commercially available wrist monitor to recognize periods of walking. Walking data can then be used in conjunction with other system data to] make inferences about changes in fall risk. Thirty elderly (aged 65 and over), ambulatory volunteers residing in an independent living facility will be recruited. The volunteers will be asked to engage in normal ADLs while being monitored over a 4-hour time period. During the study, volunteers will be videotaped, monitored using the wrist device, and monitored using a body-area sensor network technology developed at the University of Virginia. The specific aims of this project will be to: 1) determine if it is feasible to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using the presence of frequencies generally associated with walking in wrist- gathered acceleration data as the differentiator, 2) determine whether individuals typically demonstrate a narrower range of walking frequencies than that suggested for the entire population, and 3) determine if it is feasible to use machine learning and time-series techniques to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using characteristics learned from walking and non-walking data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651. In order to reduce the number of falls, a continuous, non-intrusive, convenient monitoring system in an acceptable form factor which will monitor elderly individuals in their home environment for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls needs to be developed. The long-term goal of this project is to develop such a system; the proposed project would take the necessary step of identifying and differentiating between walking and other normal activities [so that data gathered during walking can be used to recognize changes in stability for an individual, and then can be used in conjunction with other system data already being automatically collected in real-time to recognize an increased probability of falling both during walking or other activities.]           Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.

"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.           Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Cognitive decline in aging arises when age-associated neuropathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand or adapt to those processes. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. Using antibody microarrays for discovery and multi-analyte immunoassays for validation in brain tissues from participants of the Religious Orders Study, we will identify potential novel mechanisms of cognitive resilience in aging.

"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.

"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated. Finally, the work will refine the tools needed to feasibly assess physical activity in young and old adults. These accomplishments will directly impact the fields of epidemiology, geriatric medicine, rehabilitation, and nutritional sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the understanding the differences in the metabolic costs of daily activities due to old age and functional impairment. This is highly relevant to NIH's mission of promoting health by reducing the burdens of physical disability in old age.                ",Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults,8504141,R01AG042525,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Ankle ', ' Beds ', ' Body Weight ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Client ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Exertion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Mission ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Pulmonary Gas Exchange ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' falls ', ' forest ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' milliliter ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' American ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' vector ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2013,332841,FL-03,0.060618259539113775
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.

"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.        Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.            ",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8738041,R01EB019406,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Amputees ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Assistance ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' human population density ', ' Population Density ', ' Prosthesis Design ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Rain ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' falls ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Survivors ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Data Quality ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Simulate ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' information gathering ', ' cohort ', ' trafficking ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' fear of falling ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' improving mobility ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' ']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2014,361215,IL-07,0.04513250556913428
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.            ",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),8696515,K23HL119352,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Data Sources ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Health ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Posture ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' frailty ', ' Hour ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Physical Function ', ' behavior change ', ' innovative technologies ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' light intensity ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' tv watching ', ' time use ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2014,143504,WA-07,0.10457862822339802
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of  antidepressants for treating de- pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately re- duce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8634379,K01AG044433,"['Adoption ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' delirious ', ' Delirium ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' geropsychopharmacology ', ' geropsychology ', ' geropsychiatry ', ' geriatric psychology ', ' Psychogeriatrics ', ' Psychiatry for the elderly ', ' Psychiatry for seniors ', ' Psychiatry for older people ', ' Psychiatry for older adults ', ' Geriatric Psychiatry ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' hypnotic ', ' Interview ', ' Jordan ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nurse Practitioners ', ' Nurses ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' sedative ', ' Syndrome ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Support ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Vent ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Informatics ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' fall risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' electronic data ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Mood stabilizers ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2014,114449,PA-18,0.03629827925922769
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8617361,P50DC000422,"['auditory nerve ', ' Vestibulocochlear Nerve ', ' VIIIth Cranial Nerve ', ' Eighth Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve VIII ', ' Cranial Nerve Eight ', ' Acoustic Nerve ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Audiometric Test ', ' Audiogram ', ' Audiometry ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Heredity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' age related hearing loss ', ' Presbycusis ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Temporal Bone ', ' Temporal bone structure ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Injury ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' speech recognition ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' Physical shape ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Sampling ', ' adult stem cell ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Pathologic ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2014,2047726,SC-01,0.048531664475708926
"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated. Finally, the work will refine the tools needed to feasibly assess physical activity in young and old adults. These accomplishments will directly impact the fields of epidemiology, geriatric medicine, rehabilitation, and nutritional sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the understanding the differences in the metabolic costs of daily activities due to old age and functional impairment. This is highly relevant to NIH's mission of promoting health by reducing the burdens of physical disability in old age.                ",Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults,8700285,R01AG042525,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Ankle ', ' Beds ', ' Body Weight ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Client ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Exertion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Mission ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Pulmonary Gas Exchange ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' falls ', ' forest ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' milliliter ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' American ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' vector ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' mathematical methods ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2014,315991,FL-03,0.060618259539113775
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age ≥ 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure. This question is of great relevance as U.S. elders are living longer than any prior generation, and the majority have high blood pressure.",A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age,8756375,R01AG046206,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Hypotension ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Walkers ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' meetings ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2014,314270,CA-12,0.06614712434437368
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled. Married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditions and disability of their own but also their spouse's.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology.

"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Cognitive decline in aging arises when age-associated neuropathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand or adapt to those processes. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies.

"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.                ",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,8885952,R01AG048069,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' glycerophosphatase ', ' alkaline phosphomonoesterase ', ' Orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase (alkaline optimum) ', ' Alkaline Phosphatase ', ' Award ', ' Body Composition ', ' bone ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Independent Living ', ' indexing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' Structural Models ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parathyroid Head and Neck ', ' Parathyroid ', ' Parathyroid gland ', ' Phosphorous ', ' P element ', ' Phosphorus ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Clinical ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Nutritional Supplement ', ' Diet Supplement ', ' Dietary Supplements ', ' Funding ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' frailty ', ' calcium intake ', ' Physical Function ', ' muscle strength ', ' Osteoporotic fracture ', ' Osteoporosis with fracture ', ' Fracture due to osteoporosis ', ' osteoporosis with pathological fracture ', ' skeletal ', ' Endocrine ', ' 25-hydroxyvitamin D ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' FGF23 gene product ', ' fibroblast growth factor 23 ', ' fall risk ', ' Dietary intake ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Supplementation ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' sex ', ' ultraviolet ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' bone health ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2015,356753,MD-07,0.1533014262701844
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention.

"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.            ",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,8907211,R01AG049006,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Control Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maintenance ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Motivation ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Specificity ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Transfer (Psychology) ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Training ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Sample Size ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' active control ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' usability ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' Regimen ', ' tablet device ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2015,602211,CA-45,0.11229547591347569
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"In-home monitoring system for assessing gait using wall-mounted RF transceivers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a new system called GaitRF that can measure walking speed and other detailed gait parameters passively within the home. The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as those suffering from neurologic or physical ailments. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health. Gait is typically measured periodically within a clinical setting. In-home monitoring offers the advantage of continuous and ongoing measurements providing significantly more information about changes in a patient's health under real life conditions. Ongoing accurate estimation of gait within the home can help to guide caregivers about the need for transitioning older adults to higher levels of care. Accurate in-home gait monitoring also has the potential to encourage older adults to maintain independence later into their lives by enabling family members and friends to monitor health status remotely.  The proposed system makes use of novel wireless technology being developed at EmbedRF. An array of tiny transceivers are positioned in either a hallway or doorframe and configured to wirelessly send radio frequency (RF) signals between each other. As a person walks past the transceivers, their body disrupts the RF signal strength allowing for the estimation of gait metric without the need for the person to wear any monitoring device. Preliminary results using only 2 or 4 transceivers have already demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate walking speed. Preliminary results also show the unique ability to discriminate between individuals for use in a multi-resident home or to exclude data when a caregiver or friend visits. Specific aims in this proposal will 1) further develop prototype systems for walking speed estimation using transceiver pairs, 2) research and develop use of an array of sensors placed at base-board height in order to extract more detailed gait metrics; a second transceiver pair will be placed at approximate head height to provide multi-person discrimination capability, and 3) perform preliminary in-home evaluations of the GaitRF system. Advanced machine learning and tracking algorithms will be utilized to process the RF signals to extract gait metrics. We will evaluate the performance of GaitRF in both a laboratory setting and within single-resident and multi- resident homes of seniors.  If successful, this new system has the advantage of being low-cost, unobtrusive, and easy to install, while still providing accurate and detailed gait metrics. The system can be used as a stand-alone gait monitor or incorporated into more general health monitoring systems. Application of the technology will support independent living and may also be used in clinical trials of drugs or procedures that affect mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as individuals suffering from cognitive or physical impairment.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Cognitive decline in aging arises when age-associated neuropathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand or adapt to those processes. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8898070,R01EB019406,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Amputees ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Assistance ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' human population density ', ' Population Density ', ' Prosthesis Design ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Rain ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' falls ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Survivors ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Data Quality ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' information gathering ', ' cohort ', ' trafficking ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' fear of falling ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' improving mobility ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,329394,IL-07,0.04513250556913428
"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated. Finally, the work will refine the tools needed to feasibly assess physical activity in young and old adults.

"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8786533,P50DC000422,"['auditory nerve ', ' Vestibulocochlear Nerve ', ' VIIIth Cranial Nerve ', ' Eighth Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve VIII ', ' Cranial Nerve Eight ', ' Acoustic Nerve ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Audiometric Test ', ' Audiogram ', ' Audiometry ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Heredity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' age related hearing loss ', ' Presbycusis ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Temporal Bone ', ' Temporal bone structure ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Injury ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' speech recognition ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' Physical shape ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Sampling ', ' adult stem cell ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Pathologic ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2015,2302752,SC-01,0.048531664475708926
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people.

"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9133378,R01EB019406,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Amputees ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Assistance ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Population Density ', ' prosthetic design ', ' Prosthesis Design ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Rain ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' falls ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Fall prevention ', ' preventing falls ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Data Quality ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' information gathering ', ' cohort ', ' trafficking ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' fear of falling ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' improving mobility ', ' data exchange ', ' data transmission ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Fall injury ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,333618,IL-07,0.04513250556913428
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people.

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities.

"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,9147536,R01AG048069,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' glycerophosphatase ', ' alkaline phosphomonoesterase ', ' Alkaline Phosphatase ', ' Award ', ' Body Composition ', ' bone ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Independent Living ', ' indexing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' Structural Models ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Phosphorous ', ' P element ', ' Phosphorus ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Clinical ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Funding ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' frailty ', ' calcium intake ', ' Physical Function ', ' muscle strength ', ' Osteoporotic fracture ', ' Osteoporosis with fracture ', ' Fracture due to osteoporosis ', ' osteoporosis with pathological fracture ', ' skeletal ', ' Endocrine ', ' 25-hydroxyvitamin D ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' FGF23 gene product ', ' fibroblast growth factor 23 ', ' fall risk ', ' Dietary intake ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' parathormone ', ' Parathyroid Hormone ', ' Parathyrin ', ' PTH gene ', ' Address ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' sex ', ' ultraviolet ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' bone health ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Gait speed ', ' Vitamin D supplementation ', ' vitamin D supplement ', ' Supplementation with vitamin D ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2016,321959,MD-07,0.1533014262701844
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9242212,K08HS024558,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2016,162518,WI-02,0.06773998334434186
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9196861,R01MH111265,"['Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' neuropathology ', ' radiofrequency ', ' mood dysfunction ', ' mood disturbance ', ' mood and affect disturbance ', ' mood alteration ', ' disturbance in affect ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' vascular depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' aging brain ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' absorption ', ' abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Consultations ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' Gliosis ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Head ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heating ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,685522,PA-18,0.10986810244554147
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9272127,UH2NS100599,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' advanced dementia ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' sharing data ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2016,1111944,IL-07,-0.029606886594790233
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled.

"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9222881,K01LM012439,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Couples ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Learning ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' instructor ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' rehabilitation technology ', ' rehab technology ', ' usability ', ' multisensory ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' support tools ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' primary care giver ', ' individual patient ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' ']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,168375,OH-07,0.09464631702747804
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure. This question is of great relevance as U.S. elders are living longer than any prior generation, and the majority have high blood pressure.",A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age,8925759,R01AG046206,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Hypotension ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Walkers ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' meetings ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' blood pressure reduction ', ' reduction in blood pressure ', ' reduction in BP ', ' reduce blood pressure ', ' reduce BP ', ' lower blood pressure ', ' lower BP ', ' BP reduction ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2016,309383,CA-12,0.06614712434437368
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9012784,P50DC000422,"['auditory nerve ', ' Vestibulocochlear Nerve ', ' VIIIth Cranial Nerve ', ' Eighth Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve VIII ', ' Cranial Nerve Eight ', ' Acoustic Nerve ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Audiometric Test ', ' Audiogram ', ' Audiometry ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Heredity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' age related hearing loss ', ' Presbyacusis ', ' Presbycusis ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Temporal Bone ', ' Temporal bone structure ', ' Testing ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Injury ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' speech recognition ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' morphological signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' Physical shape ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Sampling ', ' adult stem cell ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Pathologic ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Prevalence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Regimen ', ' support network ', ' ']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2016,2214679,SC-01,0.048531664475708926
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),9115229,K23HL119352,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Data Sources ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Health ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Posture ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' frailty ', ' Hour ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Physical Function ', ' behavior change ', ' innovative technologies ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' light intensity ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' tv watching ', ' time use ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' older women ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' cardio-metabolic risk ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2016,142671,WA-07,0.10457862822339802
"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated. Finally, the work will refine the tools needed to feasibly assess physical activity in young and old adults. These accomplishments will directly impact the fields of epidemiology, geriatric medicine, rehabilitation, and nutritional sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the understanding the differences in the metabolic costs of daily activities due to old age and functional impairment.

"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,9103121,R01EB009675,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Environment ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sleep ', ' Societies ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Software Design ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Progress Reports ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' functional status ', ' computer science ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' technology development ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' actigraphy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' user-friendly ', ' usability ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,333930,WA-05,0.12467096320373186
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9382352,R01AG055337,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cognition ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospital Records ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Memory ', ' Modernization ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Caring ', ' Comprehension ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Evaluation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' frailty ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Subgroup ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Perioperative ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Behavioral ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive ability ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,479151,FL-03,0.06055822169772096
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9205503,P50DC000422,"['auditory nerve ', ' Vestibulocochlear Nerve ', ' VIIIth Cranial Nerve ', ' Eighth Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve VIII ', ' Cranial Nerve Eight ', ' Acoustic Nerve ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Audiometric Test ', ' Audiogram ', ' Audiometry ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Heredity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Presbycusis ', ' age related hearing loss ', ' Presbyacusis ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Supervision ', ' Temporal bone structure ', ' Temporal Bone ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Injury ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' American ', ' speech recognition ', ' cohesion ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Physical shape ', ' morphological signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' adult stem cell ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Pathologic ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Regimen ', ' support network ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2017,2137301,SC-01,0.048531664475708926
"Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stages, poses a significant burden to the community and health care system. Several other pathologic processes often co-exist with AD pathology. Characterizing the multi-faceted aspects of brain changes present in aging and (prodromal) AD not only provides insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes, such as amyloid deposition, small vessel ischemic disease(SVID), and neurodegeneration or functional change, but also leads to biomarkers of these pathologic processes. In this proposal, we aim to capture the heterogeneity of various imaging patterns that reflect pathologic processes occurring with aging and prodromal AD, by applying state of the art heterogeneity analysis machine learning methods recently developed in our laboratory to multi-faceted imaging data (structural MRI, resting state functional MRI, amyloid imaging). These methods allow us to quantify the different ways/patterns in which an individual can fall off the normative brain aging trajectories. Our goal is to arrive at a new “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), each dimension of which will reflect a different pattern of brain alterations, hence capturing the underlying neuroanatomical, neurofunctional and neuropathological heterogeneity in quantifiable and replicable metrics. Moreover, we aim to link these neuroimaging phenotypes with neurocognitive phenotypes, as well as with progression from cognitively normal aging to MCI and to dementia. This will allow us to place each individual into a new dimensional brain coordinate system of aging and map his/her trajectory, as well to determine predictive indices emanating from multi-parametric imaging data. Prior to achieving these aims, we will strengthen and apply various imaging harmonization methods, which are critical in ensuring that data across studies and scanners can be integrated in a constructive way. In particular, Aim1 will apply inter-site imaging harmonization methods, and hence develop a platform that will allow us to integrate multi-parametric imaging datasets from more than 10,000 participants to several studies spanning ages 45 to 89; we will therefore form a large multi-modal imaging database capturing the heterogeneity of normal brain aging and prodromal AD. Aim 2 will use machine learning methods to integrate spatial patterns of brain atrophy, SVID, Aβ deposition and functional connectivity in this population, and will derive normative brain aging curves. Aim 3 will use state of the art semi-supervised learning methods to disentangle the heterogeneity of imaging patterns distinguishing resilient from advanced brain aging: this will lead to the dimensional system (iSTAGING) capturing the diverse dimensions/patterns of advanced (non-resilient) age-related brain change relative to resilient brain aging, which reflect underlying neuropathological processes. Aim 4 will relate iSTAGING coordinates and longitudinal trajectories to cognition, risk factors, and clinical progression from normal cognition to MCI to dementia, in order to further elucidate the clinical correlates of these neuroimaging dimensions. Project narrative This proposal pools imaging data from 11 different studies, with a total of more than 10,000 individuals of ages 45 to 95, aiming to obtain a comprehensive characterization of brain aging. State of the art imaging harmonization, pattern analysis and machine learning methods will be used to derive normative brain aging curves, and to characterize the heterogeneity of deviations from these curves in people with resilient and accelerated brain aging. Moreover, we aim to relate these imaging patterns to cognitive performance. We will eventually derive and “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), allowing us to place any individual's scans into a quantitative measurement system and plot his/her trajectories over time.","Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis",9211062,RF1AG054409,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ',

"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated. Finally, the work will refine the tools needed to feasibly assess physical activity in young and old adults. These accomplishments will directly impact the fields of epidemiology, geriatric medicine, rehabilitation, and nutritional sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the understanding the differences in the metabolic costs of daily activities due to old age and functional impairment. This is highly relevant to NIH's mission of promoting health by reducing the burdens of physical disability in old age.",Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults,9291394,R01AG042525,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Ankle ', ' Beds ', ' Body Weight ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Client ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exercise ', ' Exertion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Mission ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulmonary Gas Exchange ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' forest ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' milliliter ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' cardio-pulmonary ', ' American ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' portability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' vector ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' rehabilitation science ', ' mathematical methods ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition science ', ' metabolic rate ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,293788,FL-03,0.060618259539113775
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9353310,K08HS024558,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2017,157988,WI-02,0.06773998334434186
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure. This question is of great relevance as U.S. elders are living longer than any prior generation, and the majority have high blood pressure.",A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age,9519485,R01AG046206,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Walkers ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' blood pressure reduction ', ' reduction in blood pressure ', ' reduction in BP ', ' reduce blood pressure ', ' reduce BP ', ' lowers blood pressure ', ' lower blood pressure ', ' lower BP ', ' BP reduction ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2017,163148,CA-12,0.06614712434437368
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9370133,R01NR016732,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Rehabilitation Nursing ', ' Restorative Nursing ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' behavior change ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' technology implementation ', ' technology validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' intervention effect ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' brain health ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,352983,WA-05,0.06384597401137891
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.",Investigating Sedentary

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9212418,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Cd element ', ' Cadmium ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Biometals ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,792334,MA-07,-0.01996203258613288
"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups.

"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9339726,K01LM012439,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Couples ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' instructor ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' rehabilitation technology ', ' rehab technology ', ' usability ', ' multisensory ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' support tools ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' primary care giver ', ' individual patient ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' ']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,170236,OH-07,0.09464631702747804
"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life. This project will examine how changes in the structural connections between brain regions relate to changes in cognitive abilities over time and test hypothesized health, sociodemographic, and genetic predictors of such changes.",Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging,9385440,R01AG054628,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Brain region ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Visuospatial ', ' visual spatial ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' 3 year old ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' network architecture ', ' cognitive performance ', ' genetic predictors ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' connectome ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2017,502543,TX-10,0.05443760076968244
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9356352,UH2NS100599,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multimodality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' sharing data ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' clinical imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,1102656,IL-07,-0.029606886594790233
"Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the  top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent  hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the  activities of daily living. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase  quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a  fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices  require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of  showing caregivers how falls occur.  Our goal is to deploy and demonstrate NestSense (also known as SafelyYou), an online fall detection  system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to passively detect falls for patients with AD and  related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL will confirm the fall  detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms. We will demonstrate it for 100  patients in 13 memory care facilities. Memory care facilities can select parameters that matter for  specific patients; for ex., some patients wake up frequently during the night while others should  be assisted when they attempt to leave the bed at night. It does not require action of individuals  / caregivers such as wearing a fall pendant and is therefore well-suited for individuals with ADRD.  We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence)  approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will  call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The human can monitor  several facilities at a given time.  This project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 13 memory care facilities,  recruited through our previous (IRB approved) pilot. The work will leverage our previous three  pilots. • Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting a proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. • Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility from  the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to  clinical benefits including a reduction of falls from 13 and 11 in the first 2 months to 2 in the  final month, due to video review with care staff. • Pilot 3 (ongoing): We demonstrated scalability and further acceptance by deploying the system in  13 facilities of the Carlton, Integral Senior Living, Pacifica and SRG networks, totaling 100  patients already monitored by our system (offline). The pilot proposed for this SBIR Phase I will translate the 100 cameras in these facilities into a  real-time fall detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL support.  Compared to a 3-month baseline from the 100 cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on results described in previous clinical trials with 150+  participants [8,14]. The proposed NestSense system uses off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to perform detection of  safety-critical events for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia patients in memory care  facilities. It does not rely on active use from the patients or caregivers (e.g., through wearing  any kind of device). The NestSense technology provides the first robust non-wearable fall detection  tuned specifically to the privacy-security tradeoffs of dementia care. It provides an answer to  today’s technology gaps (far from 100% reliability) by use of a Human-in-the Loop (HIL) paradigm to  enable a quick rollout of the technology. Following the acceptance of privacy safety tradeoffs of  our system by patients, family, and memory care staff in the Carlton, Integral Senior Living,  Pacifica and SRG networks, we have deployed the system in offline mode in 13 facilities of the  network, monitoring 100 patients. The research, implementation, and deployment work encompassed in  this SBIR Phase I will provide validation that the existing prototype can be rolled out to a proof  of concept, operational in real-time mode, with HIL, to reduce fall-related hospitalizations and  time spent on the ground. The pilot follows 3 previous pilots, the most recent of which deploys  cameras with these 100 patients in offline mode to study the effect on the fall rate of  occupational therapist review of fall video in memory care. This study will translate those cameras  into a real-time fall (online) detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL  support. Compared to a 3-month baseline from the cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on previous clinical trials with 100+ participants [8,14].",Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias,9465622,R43AG058354,"['Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Length ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' Security ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' prototype ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' dementia care ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' Accidents ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Beds ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Memory ', ' Occupational Therapist ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Video Recording ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' falls ', ' Managed Care ', ' Scheduling and Staffing ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' ']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R43,2017,150000,CA-13,0.03506768313092375
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled. Married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditions and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping older adults stay healthy and maintain functional independence into late life.",Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App,9282761,K01AG042450,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' pepper ', ' Capsicum ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Couples ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' career ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' commune ', ' Speed ', ' intimate behavior ', ' intimacy ', ' member ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Address ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' faculty mentor ', ' family caregiving ', ' family care giving ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,125654,CT-03,0.12898374727716683
"Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults Project Summary Background Palliative care is known to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care utiliza- tion in patients with cancer. But we know little on how to deliver palliative care to the large and growing population of older patients with multiple chronic conditions. Palliative care clinicians are a scarce resource, so care must be targeted to the subset of patients who would benefit most: those at highest risk of near-term death. This is a major challenge outside of specific diseases with known trajectories. Clinicians struggle with prognosis, and current statistical models perform poorly. Aims We will use novel predictive modeling methods (`machine learning') to identify complex old- er patients at high risk of one-year mortality, drawing on our team's prior work in data analytics and machine learning. We will apply these methods to a diverse population of older patients with multi- ple chronic conditions, in a large academic primary care network. Building on our team's track rec- ord of successful clinical trials, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of palliative care inte- grated with primary care, targeting older patients at the highest predicted risk of death. We will as- sess impact on a range of measurable patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization. Study design We will develop a model to predict one-year mortality in primary care patients over 65, using a rich set of variables from electronic health records. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning models are highly accurate for predicting mortality out-of-sample, i.e., in patients the model has never seen. We will identify patients at the highest risk of death—who would benefit most from scarce palliative care resources—and approach them to participate in a randomized trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care. The intervention, a series of home-based visits by palliative care clinicians, will build a longitudinal relationship with the patient and primary care team. This strategy is designed specifically to meet the needs of older pa- tients, as well as busy primary care clinicians. We will power the study to detect changes in two primary outcomes: quality of life and care intensity, measured by hospital and emergency visits. Other outcomes include symptom burden, advanced care planning, hospice use, and mortality. Implications This project will generate the first evidence on a new model of palliative care for older adults with multiple chronic illnesses, delivered `upstream' in the disease trajectory. We will build the technical and clinical infrastructure needed to target palliative care interventions for older adults outside of specific disease-based programs. A successful trial would facilitate broader adop- tion of similar interventions for older adults, and fundamentally transform the scale and scope of palliative care efforts in this population. Project Narrative Despite major advances in palliative care for patients with specific diseases, we know little about how to deliver palliative interventions `upstream'—earlier in the disease trajectory for older adults with multiple chronic conditions. We will apply advanced predictive modeling techniques (`machine learning') to identify older patients in a primary care setting who would benefit most from palliative care: those whose complex interplay of chronic conditions puts them at high risk of near-term death. Building on our team's strong infrastructure for clinical trials in palliative care, we will enroll the highest-risk patients in a randomized controlled trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care.",Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults,9565691,R56AG055728,"['Adoption ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Awareness ', ' Boston ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Records ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' prognostic ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' palliative ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Predictive Value ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' SF-12 ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' trial comparing ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Patient risk ', ' Data Analytics ', ' improved outcome ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' ']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R56,2017,382595,MA-07,0.11533130362314307
"Memory precision and generalization: aging effects on the cognitive and neural basis of adaptive memory function Project Summary Precision and generalization are two fundamental properties of memory function. The former allows individuals to distinguish between similar episodes to reduce interference. The latter allows individuals to link information across episodes and apply past knowledge to new situations. Advanced age is associated with declines in memory function that affect some aspects of memory more than others. Memory specificity, in particular, is known to show substantial age-related decline, whereas the ability to remember the `gist' of past events is typically intact. However, it is unclear if the spared gist memory is related to generalization or simply reflects a lack of specificity. If generalized representations form independently of event-specific representations, older may show intact generalization. Alternatively, if generalization arises from representations of individual events, aging may reduce memory specificity and impair generalization. The proposed research seeks to test the relationship between memory precision and generalization and how that relationship changes with age. Using category learning as a representative domain, three studies will use cognitive modeling of behavioral data, pattern information analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and model-based fMRI to identify the cognitive and neural bases of memory precision and generalization in young and older adults. Study 1 will test the hypothesis that young but not older adults deploy generalization and precision flexibly depending on the task context. To do so, a category-learning task will be used with training sets that we expect will differ in their demands on representing individual items (i.e., precision) and abstracting to a category prototype (i.e., generalization). Participants will then be tested on memory for individual exemplars presented during training (precision test) and on their ability to classify new exemplars (generalization test). Study 2 will test the hypothesis that older adults have difficulty forming representations of individual items while representations of abstract, prototypical information remain stable with age. FMRI data will be collected while young and older adults complete the training phase of a category-learning task. We will use pattern information analyses (multivariate pattern analysis, representational similarity analysis) and model-based fMRI to track the development of item and category representations over the course of learning in each age group. Study 3 will test the hypothesis that young adults maintain representations of both individual exemplars and category prototypes, and that exemplar representations are used primarily during recognition whereas prototype representations are used primarily during categorization. We propose that older adults will use prototype representations during both categorization and recognition due to difficulties in utilizing exemplar representations. Together, these studies will characterize age-related changes in the relationship between generalization and precision in order to serve as a comparison model for age-related dementias and support development of interventions to aid memory-based cognition. Project Narrative The proposed research investigates the effects of aging on precision and generalization in memory. Characterizing age-related changes in the relationship between generalization and precision will serve as a comparison model for age-related dementias and support development of interventions that can aid memory accuracy and memory flexibility.",Memory precision and generalization: aging effects on the cognitive and neural basis of adaptive memory function,9327286,F32AG054204,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cognition ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Stimulus Generalization ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Dissociation ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' age group ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' data modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' neocortical ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' prototype ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F32,2017,56694,OR-04,0.040247326669077044
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions.

"Integrated Web-Based Customer Engagement, Physical Exercise, and Coaching Platform for Older Adults ABSTRACT The fast-growing older population coupled with the worsening shortage of caregivers and nurses will soon present our nation with severe societal and economic challenges. Older adults often struggle to maintain quality of life and independence in the presence of chronic diseases and isolation. Physical exercise and socialization have been shown to reduce chronic disease, depression, falls and to improve quality of life in older adults. Motivation and feedback are essential to continued engagement in a wellness program, but doing so through the traditional manner of in-person coaching can be prohibitively expensive. Vigorous Mind (VM) has been providing a web-based platform to promote sustained engagement in older adults primarily in senior living facilities. The platform provides dynamic and tailored content including reminiscence activities, favorite music and video, adaptive computer games and communication. With the help of the Consortium on Technology for Proactive Care, we will enhance the current VM system with an additional interactive physical exercise module and a health coach with automated tailored messaging and incentives for continued engagement and adherence. This will optimize the VM system for home-based deployment, thus expanding the reach and impact of VM to potentially delay or even prevent institutionalization among older adults living independently. There is a compelling need for a tool that can increase older adults’ engagement in physical activity and socialization to reduce chronic disease, depression and falls and improve quality of life in this fast-growing population. The proposed integrated web-based platform represents the first step in the development of environments that combine human and machine intelligence in order to care for older adults and to enhance their quality of life.","Integrated Web-Based Customer Engagement, Physical Exercise, and Coaching Platform for Older Adults",9408822,R43AG057337,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incentives ', ' Independent Living ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Motivation ', ' Music ', ' Persons ', ' Nurses ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Retirement ', ' Rewards ', ' Socialization ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wellness Program ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' falls ', ' Businesses ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' tool ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' Test Result ', ' Participant ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Coupled ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' tailored messaging ', ' usability ', ' iterative design ', ' computer game ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' ']",NIA,"VIGOROUS MIND, INC.",R43,2017,218333,MA-04,0.1268708109803364
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure.

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9346004,R01AG053163,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Aging ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' Industry ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Jordan ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' statistics ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' family structure ', ' social ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' diet and exercise ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' psychoeducational intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' psychoeducational ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' education research ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,579139,FL-27,0.1437080099778258
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9341305,R01EB019406,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Amputees ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Assistance ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Phonation ', ' Population Density ', ' Prosthesis Design ', ' prosthetic design ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Rain ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' falls ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Data Quality ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' portability ', ' fear of falling ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' fall risk ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' improving mobility ', ' data exchange ', ' data transmission ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' stroke survivor ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' ']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,333587,IL-07,0.04513250556913428
"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,9284375,R01AG049006,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Control Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Motivation ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Specificity ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Training ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Sample Size ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' active control ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' aged ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public health relevance ', ' follow up assessment ', ' Regimen ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,648284,CA-45,0.11229547591347569
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,9303391,R01EB009675,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Environment ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Phonation ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sleep ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' functional status ', ' computer science ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' technology development ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' actigraphy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' user-friendly ', ' usability ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public health relevance ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' clinical translation ', ' ']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,334829,WA-05,0.12467096320373186
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population.

"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI.

"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of

"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity.

"Technology-Enabled Therapy for Elders with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Co-morbid Insomnia Abstract Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often viewed as a transitional stage between normal aging and early stage of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. MCI affects up to 20% of the population of older adults, and sleep disturbances have been identified as one of the core neuropsychiatric problems in MCI. Sleep disturbances are associated with a range of negative outcomes for persons with MCI, including worsening cognitive function, physical function, depression, and fatigue, which can all lead to functional impairments that greatly reduce quality of life. One of the most common sleep disturbances in persons with MCI is insomnia, with a prevalence of 44%. While non-pharmacological treatments, especially in-person cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), have demonstrated clinical efficacy in improving sleep and preserving cognitive function in the general population of older adults, there have been few studies focused on adapting CBTI for older adults with MCI.  The goal of this SBIR Phase I is to develop and test a provider-supported, technology-enabled system to adapt and deliver evidence-based CBTI to persons with MCI and co-morbid insomnia, with the support of health providers. The proposed intervention combines internet/mobile-based delivery and smart messaging prompts as reminders to compensate for cognitive processes that can be impaired in MCI. Specific aims for this Phase I include: (1) Develop a technology-enabled system to deliver CBTI for older adults with MCI; (2) Conduct formative evaluations with persons with MCI to refine smart messaging prompts and test usability of the patient software platform, and cognitive interviews with providers to assess feasibility of implementing the intervention in the clinical setting; and (3) Conduct a six-week pilot randomized controlled trial to assess preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of the CBTI intervention. We hypothesize that participants in the CBTI intervention group will demonstrate a significant improvement in quality of sleep (both subjective and objective), and an improvement in cognitive and physical functioning, compared to those in the control group.  Data collected in Phase I will be used to determine the sample size necessary for an adequately powered Phase II randomized trial. If successful, this product will contribute to the adoption and dissemination of a low-cost, multi-technology enabled CBTI intervention to reduce sleep disturbances, and improve cognitive and physical function among persons with MCI. A successful Phase II study will result in a technology-enabled program that can benefit multiple types of provider organizations (mental health clinics, primary care clinics, and geriatric clinics) serving large numbers of older adults with MCI, thus having significant commercial potential. Narrative More than 5 million people in the United States suffer from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with over 44% of them experiencing insomnia. Given the negative outcomes associated with MCI and co-morbid insomnia, there is strong interest in developing non-pharmacological treatments for improving sleep in this population of older adults. The proposed project provides a technology-enabled system that is designed to adapt cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) for older adults with MCI. Combining emerging innovative technologies with evidence-based practice, the proposed CBTI intervention system has the potential to be deployed by multiple provider organizations, including mental health clinics, primary care clinics, geriatric clinics, and home care agencies, potentially benefiting millions of older adults in the U.S. who have MCI and co-morbid sleep

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge.

The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in

"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals. We will provide advanced brain image processing, mathematical tools, and a portal for researchers to access and add to findings.",High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging

"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9423915,R01AG057704,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Demography ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Hand ', ' Handwriting ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Marriage ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sanitation ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Toxin ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' health knowledge ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' intergenerational ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Maiden Name ', ' Maiden ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' population health ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' early-life nutrition ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,325845,MI-12,0.0524482491119047
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9576319,R01AG059729,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Body Composition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' male ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement) Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Summary Dementia affects over 5 million older adults in the US, with vast implications for individual patients, their caregivers, and social programs designed to support increasing health care needs. Research to date has not fully clarified the role that multiple co-occurring chronic conditions (multimorbidity) play in the provision of appropriate care for racially and ethnically diverse groups of older adults with mild or more severe cognitive impairment. As a result, there is a need for greater understanding of the complex interactions between existing morbidity combinations, cognitive impairment, and the receipt of essential and appropriate care. As of yet, it is unclear whether specific multimorbidity combinations alongside cognitive impairment present greater difficulty in accessing good-quality, and appropriate care and preventive services among older adults from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds. The supplement extends from the research conducted in the parent award by focusing on older adults with cognitive impairment or dementia and co-existing chronic conditions. The goal of this supplement is to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in the quality of care received for older adults with dementia and competing multimorbidity care demands. We propose to use existing databases and multimorbidity combinations and patterns recently found in the parent grant. Our proposed research employs data from over 20 years of nationally-representative biennial surveys (~38,000 sampled people in the Health & Retirement Study) linked to Medicare claims. We propose two aims:  Aim 1. Determine racial and ethnic differences in receipt of preventive services among older adults with  mild or severe cognitive impairment and various multimorbidity combinations.  Aim 2. Evaluate racial and ethnic differences in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and  emergency department (ED) visits with discharge among older adults with mild or severe cognitive  impairment and various multimorbidity patterns.

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9558429,R44AG059458,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fire -

"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,9507749,R01AG049006,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Belief ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cognition ', ' Control Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Motivation ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Specificity ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Training ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Sample Size ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' active control ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' aged ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' usability ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' follow up assessment ', ' Regimen ', ' tablet device ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2018,618627,CA-45,0.11229547591347569
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9504530,R01MH111265,"['absorption ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Consultations ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Edema ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Gliosis ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Head ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Heating ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' magnetic field ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' neuropathology ', ' radiofrequency ', ' disturbance in affect ', ' mood dysfunction ', ' mood disturbance ', ' mood and affect disturbance ', ' mood alteration ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' vascular depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' aged brain ', ' aging brain ', ' treatment strategy ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' imaging approach ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,665246,PA-18,0.10986810244554147
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9573304,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Biometals ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,755603,MA-07,-0.01996203258613288
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes.

"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose.

Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address.

"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9718452,UH3NS100599,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multimodality ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' sharing data ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' protective factors ', ' in vivo testing ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' pathology imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2018,1165858,IL-07,-0.029606886594790233
"Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias ABSTRACT  The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing worldwide, placing enormous burdens on healthcare providers, patients and caregivers. Many new treatments are in development and the consensus is that most interventions will need to be initiated as early in the disease progression as possible. Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) has developed sensitive non-invasive EEG biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's and evaluating treatment outcomes. The biomarkers are in use in drug trials and are being validated longitudinally in a large population of patients with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. Patients with MCI are particularly interesting as potential targets for early intervention as MCI is often a transitional state between normal aging and dementia.  This proposal introduces a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with MCI. The team combines ABM's 15-year success in implementing real-time neuro-sensing and dementia biomarkers with academic and commercial expertise in robot behavioral intervention design. Dr. Maja Mataric, USC Professor, Dr. Cory Kidd, CEO and founder, Catalia Health, and Dr. Schneider, USC Professor, will work with ABM to enable the Mabu robot to interact with participants in their homes and influence healthy habits. Catalia demonstrated that the Mabu software use of artificial intelligence to encourage social interaction improves medical adherence. This project will develop a SAR-mediated intervention for elderly users and MCI patients. Mabu will interact with participants in their homes to encourage and monitor the formation of healthy habits involving physical activity, specifically walking regularly. ABM's mobile EEG sensing systems will be used to assess dementia biomarkers pre- and post-robot intervention and during initial and final human-robot interactions, providing real-time metrics including engagement, workload, stress, and other measures of interactions between human and robot.  The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. The team envisions multi-stage user-robot interactions aimed at: increasing physical activity; enhancing cognitive skills; providing motivation; increasing well-being and improving quality of life. The Phase I focus is on increasing physical activity using the robot as a coach for a small cohort (10 healthy elderly; 10 MCI patients) selected from the ongoing ABM dementia biomarker study. Physical exercise is selected based on the specific evidence that increased activity can delay or slow cognitive decline. The Mabu robot will interact with participants twice daily in their homes for 6-weeks to encourage them to be more active. Project Narrative  This project addresses the worldwide demand for novel intervention approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias introducing a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment. The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. If successful, the SAR intervention in combination with Advanced Brain Monitoring's objective EEG sleep and daytime dementia biomarkers has the potential to assist patients in living healthier and more productive lives, maintaining independence for longer periods of time, and removing some burden from caregivers.",Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias,9679688,R43AG061994,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medicine ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Names ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Companions ', ' Robot ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' social ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' usability ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' normal aging ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' patient population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive skill ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' human-robot interaction ', ' ']",NIA,"ADVANCED BRAIN MONITORING, INC.",R43,2018,410550,CA-49,-0.057990345232247296
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure. This question is of great relevance as U.S. elders are living longer than any prior generation, and the majority have high blood pressure.",A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age,9402033,R01AG046206,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Walkers ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' systolic hypertension ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' reduction in blood pressure ', ' reduction in BP ', ' reduce blood pressure ', ' reduce BP ', ' lowers blood pressure ', ' lower blood pressure ', ' lower BP ', ' BP reduction ', ' blood pressure reduction ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2018,312569,CA-12,0.06614712434437368

"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,9597809,K23MH116105,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Consultations ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Feedback ', ' Geriatric Psychiatry ', ' geropsychopharmacology ', ' geropsychology ', ' geropsychiatry ', ' geriatric psychology ', ' Psychogeriatrics ', ' Psychiatry for the elderly ', ' Psychiatry for seniors ', ' Psychiatry for older people ', ' Psychiatry for older adults ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Matched Group ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visual attention ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' research study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' self reported behavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' extrastriate ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biosignature ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Positive Valence ', ' sustained attention ', ' learning community ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predicting response ', ' recruit ', ' Opioid drug user ', ' Opiate user ', ' Opioid user ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2018,190334,NY-12,0.04206281604578894
"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9594032,R01AG057679,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Transitions ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genealogy ', ' Geneologies ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Industrialization ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Policy Making ', ' Public Policy ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Urbanization ', ' War ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Security ', ' information security ', ' Data awareness ', ' Family member ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Data Quality ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' experience ', ' parallel processing ', ' intergenerational ', ' life history ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Population Process ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Older Population ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' health economics ', ' data integration ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' economic outcome ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Social Processes ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,695826,MN-05,0.04034803777394021
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions.

"A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness Project Summary/Abstract:  A growing number of older adults in the United States who are near the end of life are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with acute critical illness and receive invasive medical treatments. The use of prolonged life-sustaining treatments such as mechanical ventilation for older adults near death is common and increasing over time. However, most older adults report end-of-life care preferences to prioritize their comfort and quality of life near death over burdensome life-sustaining treatments. To make medical treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life-care preferences, patients and their surrogates require meaningful prognostic information in the setting of an acute illness. However, traditional prognostic tools for critically ill patients have focused on estimating patients' risk of death. Patients and surrogates often struggle to interpret or use mortality estimates for decision making, and the dichotomous outcome of mortality fails to describe the longitudinal trajectory of a patient's illness. We hypothesize that a novel tool that incorporates longitudinal prognostic information and a more descriptive account of potential outcomes will help patients, surrogates, and ICU physicians make treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life care preferences.  The central goals of this NRSA Individual Fellowship are to (1) facilitate the candidate's career development into an independent, successful health services researcher in critical care medicine and (2) address the disparity between end-of-life medical care that is delivered in the United States and patients' goals values, and preferences. The candidate and her mentors have designed a training plan to accomplish these goals that includes two specific research objectives. First, we aim to create a novel, longitudinal predictive model for critically ill adults that characterizes the expected trajectory of medical treatments over time and a description of the patient's likely outcome. To accomplish our first objective, we will apply the innovative tools of predictive analytics from the field of engineering (i.e. robust machine learning) to a large EHR-derived clinical database of all admissions to an adult medical ICU over 3 years (N ≈ 3,000 patients). The predictive model will characterize discrete, temporal patterns of patients' exposure to medical treatments during an ICU stay (“illness trajectories”) and describe the outcomes of patients who follow each trajectory. Second, we plan to use the output of our predictive model to design a user-centered prognostic tool for clinical use. Using both real and hypothetical output from our predictive model, we will engage critically ill patients (if able to participate), their surrogate decision-makers, and critical care clinicians to design and iteratively revise a prognostic tool that presents longitudinal data. The stakeholders will participate in qualitative interviews and focus groups to provide feedback about the content, format, and usability of the tool for treatment decisions in the ICU. This study will lead to the prototype of a novel, patient-centered prognostic tool that is designed to better align treatment decisions in the ICU with patients' end-of-life care preferences. Project Narrative Many critically ill patients and their families are confronted with a decision between life-prolonging but burdensome treatments or comfort-focused medical care that may lead to an earlier death. These decisions can be very difficult when there is uncertainty about whether the patient can recover and what the patient's life will be like during the illness and recovery. To help with these difficult decisions, we propose a study to design a new tool to help patients, families, and ICU clinicians predict the range of possible outcomes for an individual patient.","A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness",9467697,F32HL140824,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Award ', ' Communication ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' career ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' functional status ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' care preference ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' surrogate decision maker ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Patient risk ', ' prognostic tool ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' individual patient ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive tools ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F32,2018,59886,IL-07,0.03274094622390617
"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,9260731,R01AG048069,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' glycerophosphatase ', ' alkaline phosphomonoesterase ', ' Alkaline Phosphatase ', ' Award ', ' Body Composition ', ' bone ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Independent Living ', ' indexing ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' Structural Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Phosphorus ', ' Phosphorous ', ' P element ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' Clinical ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Funding ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' frailty ', ' calcium intake ', ' Physical Function ', ' muscle strength ', ' osteoporosis with pathological fracture ', ' Osteoporotic fracture ', ' Osteoporosis with fracture ', ' Fracture due to osteoporosis ', ' skeletal ', ' Endocrine ', ' 25-hydroxyvitamin D ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' FGF23 gene product ', ' fibroblast growth factor 23 ', ' fall risk ', ' Dietary intake ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' parathormone ', ' Parathyroid Hormone ', ' Parathyrin ', ' PTH gene ', ' Address ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' sex ', ' ultraviolet ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' bone health ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Gait speed ', ' Vitamin D supplementation ', ' vitamin D supplement ', ' Supplementation with vitamin D ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2018,320160,MD-07,0.1533014262701844
"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9708683,R01AG053163,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' indexing ', ' Industry ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Jordan ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' statistics ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' family structure ', ' social ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' diet and exercise ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' psychoeducational intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' psychoeducational ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' education research ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,589098,NY-12,0.1437080099778258
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study. We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard- of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) to provide cognitive training, in the form of learning to play the piano, to improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially-isolated older adults. The SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions: memory, attention, language, and social acuity. The goals of this project are that the SAR will (1) engage the persons with mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) in skill-building cognitive music training; (2) enhance cognitive functioning, in particular verbal and visual memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention; and (3) reduce feelings of loneliness. This SAR can be used as both a personalized social companion and an interactive tutor to deliver customized training for cognitive functioning and social engagement. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, roboticists, engineers, human factors specialists, neuroscientists, and gerontologists, well suited to achieve goals. Project Narrative Dementia is a costly chronic disease; an estimated $259 billion was spent in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, social isolation is a problem many older adults face, with 1 in 3 older adults reporting loneliness in the United States. Socially assistive robotics (SARs) have the potential to provide mental and social engagement – especially for those older adults who may lack social connections. In particular, SARs can utilize machine learning to provide customized and socially-engaging cognitive training for lonely older adults with MCI.",Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,9620766,R42AG060800,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' body language ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Engineering ', ' Esthetics ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Memory ', ' Moods ', ' Music ', ' Persons ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Play ', ' Robotics ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Specialist ', ' Social Network ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Companions ', ' Robot ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' visual memory ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' sensory integration ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Social Concepts ', ' Text ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' cognitive training ', ' cost ', ' robotic assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robot assistance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' robot interface ', ' tutorial support ', ' tutoring ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' social engagement ', ' efficacy study ', ' ']",NIA,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R42,2018,347146,MN-03,0.12090358468855165
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment.

"Memory precision and generalization: aging effects on the cognitive and neural basis of adaptive memory function Project Summary Precision and generalization are two fundamental properties of memory function. The former allows individuals to distinguish between similar episodes to reduce interference. The latter allows individuals to link information across episodes and apply past knowledge to new situations. Advanced age is associated with declines in memory function that affect some aspects of memory more than others. Memory specificity, in particular, is known to show substantial age-related decline, whereas the ability to remember the `gist' of past events is typically intact. However, it is unclear if the spared gist memory is related to generalization or simply reflects a lack of specificity. If generalized representations form independently of event-specific representations, older may show intact generalization. Alternatively, if generalization arises from representations of individual events, aging may reduce memory specificity and impair generalization. The proposed research seeks to test the relationship between memory precision and generalization and how that relationship changes with age. Using category learning as a representative domain, three studies will use cognitive modeling of behavioral data, pattern information analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and model-based fMRI to identify the cognitive and neural bases of memory precision and generalization in young and older adults. Study 1 will test the hypothesis that young but not older adults deploy generalization and precision flexibly depending on the task context. To do so, a category-learning task will be used with training sets that we expect will differ in their demands on representing individual items (i.e., precision) and abstracting to a category prototype (i.e., generalization). Participants will then be tested on memory for individual exemplars presented during training (precision test) and on their ability to classify new exemplars (generalization test). Study 2 will test the hypothesis that older adults have difficulty forming representations of individual items while representations of abstract, prototypical information remain stable with age. FMRI data will be collected while young and older adults complete the training phase of a category-learning task. We will use pattern information analyses (multivariate pattern analysis, representational similarity analysis) and model-based fMRI to track the development of item and category representations over the course of learning in each age group. Study 3 will test the hypothesis that young adults maintain representations of both individual exemplars and category prototypes, and that exemplar representations are used primarily during recognition whereas prototype representations are used primarily during categorization. We propose that older adults will use prototype representations during both categorization and recognition due to difficulties in utilizing exemplar representations. Together, these studies will characterize age-related changes in the relationship between generalization and precision in order to serve as a comparison model for age-related dementias and support development of interventions to aid memory-based cognition. Project Narrative The proposed research investigates the effects of aging on precision and generalization in memory. Characterizing age-related changes in the relationship between generalization and precision will serve as a comparison model for age-related dementias and support development of interventions that can aid memory accuracy and memory flexibility.",Memory precision and generalization: aging effects on the cognitive and neural basis of adaptive memory function,9452735,F32AG054204,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Stimulus Generalization ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Dissociation ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' age group ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Outcome ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' neocortical ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F32,2018,59038,OR-04,0.040247326669077044
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,9523024,R01AG057764,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Censuses ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Deception ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Competence ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' financial decision making ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' phishing ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' brain behavior ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' internet security ', ' cybersecurity ', ' cyber security ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Analytics ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,328606,FL-03,0.14692889533167078
"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women. This program grant will provide new and improved evidence to help the public understand how to interrupt sitting in ways that support healthy aging.  ","Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality",9519753,P01AG052352,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Laboratories ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methodology ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Posture ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' sedentary ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Blood flow ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Physical Function ', ' behavior observation ', ' behavioral observation ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Emotional ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Biostatistics Core ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' glucose regulation ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose control ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' healthy aging ', ' evidence base ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' attentional control ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' response markers ', ' response biomarker ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P01,2018,1880890,CA-52,0.12102617539533318
"India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health ABSTRACT Our revised proposal launches the India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health - a globally coordinated study of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), created response to the NIH FOA: Global Brain and Nervous System Disorders Research Across the Lifespan (R01; PAR-18-834; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-835.html). Our overall goal is to identify predictive markers in the blood, genome, and epigenome that influence brain aging in India, to better understand prognosis, and to support personalized risk evaluations on each continent. We plan to identify etiological pathways to resilience using the rich biobanking strategy developed by our partners at NIMHANS in India. To do this, we will leverage our global consortium, ENIGMA (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu), to partner with dementia research pioneers in India, creating new links between international biobanks, and building research capacity. By 2020, 70% of the world's population over age 60 will live in developing countries, with 14% in India (Mathuranath 2012). Recently, attention has been drawn to a “diversity” crisis in brain research, as most brain research is conducted in Caucasian populations from relatively wealthy backgrounds (LeWinn 2017). This lack of ethnic diversity means that: (1) we do not know if predictors of health (and disease) generalize to other ethnic groups, and (2) we fail to collect vital data that could teach us how AD progresses in populations with different genetic and environmental backgrounds. Our coordinated analyses in US/EU and Indian biobanks will help identify brain aging predictors specific to India and those that are universal. Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Create Lifespan Charts of brain aging Trajectories in India using MRI, DWI and Resting State Functional MRI. Aim 2. Identify Blood and Epigenetic Markers that Predict Brain Aging and AD in India. Aim 3. Using a combination of multimodal imaging, blood markers, and clinical data to predict clinical decline in India. We test structural equation models that hypothesize how brain aging depends on lifestyle and psychosocial factors (diet, family support, drug abuse, literacy, sleep, and depression), as well as sex, education, and AD genetic risk. With novel machine learning methods, will analyze blood markers and plasma proteomic analytes, to define processes that are harmful to brain aging. In Capacity Building Aims, we will leverage ENIGMA's successful strategies to train emerging and established scientists in India to analyze their data with high quality control and precision, with targeted biostatistical and imaging workshops to bolster capacity. This collaborative India-US initiative will enable future science initiatives, and equip the NIMHANS team with the necessary tools to train new scientists and independently conduct high impact research bridging efforts into numerous international partnerships.

"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to assess day-to-day functioning in a new way which will more effectively identify the subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence.",Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease,9762804,R01AG058687,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' functional decline ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' normal aging ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Prevention trial ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Analytics ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,540842,MN-05,-0.056640820580667196
"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,9776678,R44AG058354,"['Accidents ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Automation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Beds ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Family ', ' Floor ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Memory ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Occupational Therapist ', ' Population Control ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' Safety ', ' San Francisco ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' falls ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Letters ', ' Life ', ' Notification ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' standard of care ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' dementia care ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' care costs ', ' deep learning ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2019,493633,CA-13,0.03723770730015016
"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9769604,R01AG057679,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Transitions ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Geneologies ', ' Genealogy ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Immigration ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Industrialization ', ' Investments ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Methods ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Policy Making ', ' Public Policy ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Urbanization ', ' War ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' information security ', ' Data awareness ', ' Data Security ', ' Family member ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Quality ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' experience ', ' parallel processing ', ' intergenerational ', ' life history ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Population Process ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Older Population ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' health economics ', ' data integration ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' economic outcome ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Social Processes ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,681232,MN-05,0.04034803777394021
"Memory precision and generalization: aging effects on the cognitive and neural basis of adaptive memory function Project Summary Precision and generalization are two fundamental properties of memory function. The former allows individuals to distinguish between similar episodes to reduce interference. The latter allows individuals to link information across episodes and apply past knowledge to new situations. Advanced age is associated with declines in memory function that affect some aspects of memory more than others. Memory specificity, in particular, is known to show substantial age-related decline, whereas the ability to remember the `gist' of past events is typically intact. However, it is unclear if the spared gist memory is related to generalization or simply reflects a lack of specificity. If generalized representations form independently of event-specific representations, older may show intact generalization. Alternatively, if generalization arises from representations of individual events, aging may reduce memory specificity and impair generalization. The proposed research seeks to test the relationship between memory precision and generalization and how that relationship changes with age. Using category learning as a representative domain, three studies will use cognitive modeling of behavioral data, pattern information analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and model-based fMRI to identify the cognitive and neural bases of memory precision and generalization in young and older adults. Study 1 will test the hypothesis that young but not older adults deploy generalization and precision flexibly depending on the task context. To do so, a category-learning task will be used with training sets that we expect will differ in their demands on representing individual items (i.e., precision) and abstracting to a category prototype (i.e., generalization). Participants will then be tested on memory for individual exemplars presented during training (precision test) and on their ability to classify new exemplars (generalization test). Study 2 will test the hypothesis that older adults have difficulty forming representations of individual items while representations of abstract, prototypical information remain stable with age. FMRI data will be collected while young and older adults complete the training phase of a category-learning task. We will use pattern information analyses (multivariate pattern analysis, representational similarity analysis) and model-based fMRI to track the development of item and category representations over the course of learning in each age group. Study 3 will test the hypothesis that young adults maintain representations of both individual exemplars and category prototypes, and that exemplar representations are used primarily during recognition whereas prototype representations are used primarily during categorization. We propose that older adults will use prototype representations during both categorization and recognition due to difficulties in utilizing exemplar representations. Together, these studies will characterize age-related changes in the relationship between generalization and precision in order to serve as a comparison model for age-related dementias and support development of interventions to aid memory-based cognition. Project Narrative The proposed research investigates the effects of aging on precision and generalization in memory. Characterizing age-related changes in the relationship between generalization and precision will serve as a comparison model for age-related dementias and support development of interventions that can aid memory accuracy and memory flexibility.",Memory precision and generalization: aging effects on the cognitive and neural basis of adaptive memory function,9743047,F32AG054204,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cognition ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Stimulus Generalization ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Dissociation ', ' Neocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' age group ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' neocortical ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' prototype ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F32,2019,63746,OR-04,0.040247326669077044
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,9991267,R00AG054732,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Decision Making ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Foundations ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Memory impairment ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Performance ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Proxy ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Reporting ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Property ', ' psychobiology ', ' biopsychology ', ' biological basis of behavior ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' comparative ', ' visual information ', ' healthy aging ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' information processing ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' glutamatergic signaling ', ' glutamatergic dendrodendritic synapses ', ' glutamate signaling ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' neural network ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,248994,RI-01,0.02805608039892711
"Developing an integrated virtual assistant (IVA): A tailored behavior tracking and reminder solution to assist persons with dementia and their caregivers Project Summary/Abstract Recent attempts to estimate early stage prevalence of early stage dementia in the United States suggest that as much as 19% of the population over the age of 65 may be living with early stage disease. In early stage, function loss, particularly in the memory domain, significantly impacts instrumental activities of living (IADL) such as responsibility for own medications and scheduling. Solutions are needed that can adapt to the person with dementia and their caregiver through disease progression, tailor the level of support offered based on the changing needs of the dyad, and facilitate more time spent safely aging in place. In this project, an integrated virtual assistant (IVA) will serve as the interface between persons with dementia (PWD), their caregivers, and a suite of smart home technologies to provide aging-in-place support. Our long-term goal is to develop and commercialize IVA, a behavior tracking and reminder solution that will integrate smart home sensors, voice activation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into an easy-to-use application that provides tailored assistance to PWD and their caregivers as a dyad. The broader impact of these technologies is more time spent safely aging in place, better informed caregivers, and a reduction in caregiver burden and strain.

"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9873378,R01DA045705,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Alprazolam ', ' Alprazolan ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Baby Booms ', ' Beer ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Resources ', ' Interview ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Work ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Managed Care ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Policies ', ' Psychological Dependence ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' vehicular accident ', ' motor vehicle accident ', ' Motor carrier accident ', ' selective prevention ', ' selective preventive measure ', ' selective preventive intervention ', ' selected prevention ', ' indicated prevention ', ' prevention directed at individuals ', ' indicated preventive measure ', ' indicated preventive interventions ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' Portraits ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' fall risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' aged ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' primary care setting ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' clinical candidate ', ' rural patients ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' overdose risk ', ' benzodiazepine misuse ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,368614,MI-12,0.11213283042381172
"Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of Elderly Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia The objective of the proposed direct Phase-II SBIR project is to develop and study and the effectiveness of Serious Games and physical Activities played/performed by elderly people with Alzheimer’s disease and AD- related Dementias in interaction with Ryan, our successfully piloted Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). Ryan is an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with AD/ADRD. Ryan uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology for automated facial expression recognition, natural language processing, and tracking of human body that are used in personalization and adaptation of the games and physical activities. According to the Alzheimer’s Association an estimated 5.7 million Americans have AD and is projected to rise to 13.8 million, as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. While SAR research prototypes exist that can interact with users playing physical cognitive games equipped with artificial intelligence technology and personalization, to our knowledge, no such cooperative SAR (prototype or commercial) for electronic gameplay with individuals suffering from dementia exists today. Our game designs will target “Cognition”, “Memory”, “Spatial Relation”, “Social Relationship”, and “Motor Skills” abilities of players. We will conduct a pilot study to measure Ryan’s effectiveness in mental and socio- emotional stimulation of users with mild dementia. This innovative technology stands to produce significant financial savings and improve the quality of life of individuals living with AD/ADRD, their families, and caregivers. The goal of the project is to develop serious games and physical activities co-played by a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of

"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit. Thus, it accomplishes the National Institute on Aging's missions and initiatives by promoting effective and safe drug therapy in older adults.",Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty,9711825,R01AG062713,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' blood thinner ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Cardiovascular Agents ', ' Cardiovascular Drugs ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Vasotec ', ' Renitek ', ' Renitec ', ' Enacard ', ' Enalapril ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' indexing ', ' Neutral Endopeptidase ', ' Membrane Metalloendopeptidase ', ' Enkephalinase ', ' CD10 Antigens ', ' Neprilysin ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Safety ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Warfarin ', ' Work ', ' clopidogrel ', ' frail older adult ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' Evaluation ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Alternative Therapies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Systolic heart failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' safety study ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' head-to-head comparison ', ' head-to-head analysis ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,783556,MA-07,0.06900101229900456
"Vocal Pattern Detection of Late-Life Depression Late-life depression is a large public health problem that will only escalate with population aging in decades ahead. Depressive symptoms are well known to worsen symptoms of comorbid medical problems, pain and anxiety, causing a spiral of functional decline, disability, and loss of quality of life for older people. Rates of depression are higher among older adults who require health related assistance, including 38% of home health care, 23% of residential care, and 49% of nursing home care recipients. Despite its frequency, recognition of depression as a treatable condition is low. Innovative new approaches are needed to easily detect depression using objective markers that don't rely on subjective appraisals by older people, families, or providers. Vocal biomarkers of depression have been successfully identified in adults who are 65 years of age or younger, but no studies have examined if these methods may be applied with older people. This gap is significant because aging vocal qualities are confounded by changes associated with primary aging, sex differences, health conditions and medication use in older people. The purpose of this study is to identify vocal markers of late-life depression that will allow later development of individualized depression detection monitoring devices that overcome attitudinal barriers by providing objective biological information. Two specific study aims are to evaluate vocal patterns in older adults that are (1) distinct from and comparable to those identified for younger adults, and then (2) use machine learning to study and construct algorithms to predict depression. The observational, repeated measure design will enroll 250 participants aged 65 years and older from community settings. Audio recorded interviews will assess depression level using the PHQ-9, reading using the phonetically balanced Rainbow and Grandfather Passages, and free speech using a set of mood-neutral open-ended questions. Two interviews will be conducted for each participant using PHQ-9 scores to determine timing of follow-up interviews of either 2 weeks (PHQ-9 less than 10) or 8 weeks (PHQ-9 of 10 or greater). Interview segments will be separated using timestamps and vocal features will be extracted using openSMILE software. Each participant will serve as his/her own control in linear panel analysis. Support Vector Machine, Lasso regression, and K- means clustering will be used to predict presence and levels of depression based on PHQ-9 scores. Model performance will be assessed using the percent correcting predicted, false positive rate, and false negative rate. Outcomes from this study will guide additional research and the development of in- home monitoring and other devices that assure easy, objective identification of depressive symptoms that advance early, effective self-care approaches and treatments. Late-life depression interacts with other medical problems in a way that makes symptoms of all conditions more severe, leading to worsening health, loss of function and quality of life, and increasing disability. This devastating sequence may be avoided by identifying vocal biomarkers of depression that will hasten identification and treatment that averts unnecessary suffering. The goal of our study is to identify vocal patterns that are “biomarkers” of late-life depression so that easy-to-use monitoring systems and devices can be later developed to promote well-being and health.",Vocal Pattern Detection of Late-Life Depression,9656239,R15AG061755,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' home healthcare ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Team Nursing ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' residential care ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Speech ', ' Students ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Vocal Fold ', ' vocal cord ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Lasso ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Provider ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Nursing Informatics ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Health Communication ', ' Interruption ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' functional decline ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Mind ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' loss of function ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' community setting ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R15,2019,463500,IA-02,0.0721476476845916
"AI-enabled fully automated retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeQuant, an AI-enabled fully automated tool to com- pute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenera- tive disorders. The large, growing, and aging population is likely to lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people at risk for dementia and other cognitive disorders, with more than 130 million people expected to be affected by 2050. Vascular disease is an important cause of dementia and cognitive decline in older people. The retinal microvas- culature, which can be non-invasively captured on color fundus photographs, share em- bryological origins, anatomical features, and physiological properties with the cerebral microvasculature. Biomarkers capturing structural changes in retinal microvasculature have been shown to be indicative of cognitive disorders in patients, including mild cogni- tive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. These structural vas- culature changes can manifest themselves earlier than any functional changes commonly associated with these cognitive disorders. A tool, such as EyeQuant, that can automati- cally and easily characterize these structural changes as biomarkers directly in primary care settings using fundus photographs, would enable early detection and effective man- agement of patients with cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders. Narrative EyeQuant is an AI-enabled fully automated tool to compute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders.

"Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Advances in health care have been dramatic since the beginning of the millennium. As a result, people are living longer with age-related diseases, and the number of older individuals unable to live independently is rising rapidly. Mobile computing offers an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor behavior and use the large amount of collected data to automate analysis of functional health in a person's everyday settings. This project focuses on evaluating the performance and commercial viability of technologies that will meet some of the needs that this coming age wave introduces by automating assessment of a person's functional performance. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR application is to evaluate the feasibility of assessing an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health using behavior patterns as sensed by a smart watch. Achieving this objective will provide a foundation for the Phase II application goal of using multiple information sources to automatically-generate activity scores and functional health measures from sensor data. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach creates a profile of a person's routine behavior through automated real-time recognition of complex activities from mobile sensor data (Aim 1). We will evaluate the use of machine learning techniques to map behavior features onto cognitive and mobility health scores provided through app and in-person neuropsychological assessment (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate an interactive visual tool for displaying behavior patterns to provide individuals and their caregivers with insights on their routines and relationship with their health status (Aim 3). This work has important health care implications as functional impairment has been associated with negative outcomes including increased health care utilization, falls, and conversion to dementia. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, it is imperative to commercialize technologies that increase functional independence while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to evaluate the performance and commercial viability of an application that can predict an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health based on patterns that are sensed by a smart watch, and effectively and efficiently present this information to the caregiver. This work will lay the foundation for a commercial tool to analyze behavior routines and automate assessment of functional health. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden, and improve quality of life.",Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities,9842127,R41EB029774,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Cognition ', ' Commercial Sectors ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Independent Living ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' falls ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Active Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Apple ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' commercially viable technology ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' iterative design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' family support ', ' recruit ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' care costs ', ' health assessment ', ' functional independence ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIBIB,"ADAPTELLIGENCE, LLC",R41,2019,347739,WA-05,0.050811851217531664
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9691090,R01AG057704,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Demography ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Hand ', ' Handwriting ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Marriage ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sanitation ', ' Science ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Toxin ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Inequality ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' health knowledge ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Maiden Name ', ' Maiden ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' population health ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' early-life nutrition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,308553,MI-12,0.0524482491119047
"SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations   According to the latest US Census Bureau predictions, by 2035 older people are projected to outnumber children for the first time in US history. This brings significant societal challenges based on their unique living and health-related conditions stemming from reduced sensory, motor, and cognitive capabilities, as wen as multiple chronic conditions. We propose a personalized and context-aware voice-based digital assistant to improve the quality of life and the healthcare of older adults. VOLI will leverage the growing capabilities of existing technologies, such as mobile devices and smart speakers, and go well beyond the basics of weather reports, news services, and simple games, to provide more complex voice-based services and to focus on the healthcare domain with its many challenges and constraints. We will pursue three parallel research aims: 1) Our technical aim will investigate how digital assistants, natural language processing, and machine learning can produce meaningful health-related conversations by leveraging population- and patient-level data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs); 2) Our social, behavioral, and cognitive aim will focus on designing services for older adults based on their needs to support independence and investigate the acceptability of digital assistants for the aging population; and 3) Our clinical aim will investigate how digital assistants can detect new symptoms and correlate them with medication side effects and interactions, worsening of existing conditions, or onset of new illnesses. Using our VOLI voice-assistant, older adults will be able to get medication reminders and instructions based on prescriptions and clinical notes from EHRs, notify their family/caregiver about their well-being status, interact with their healthcare provider, request an Uber/Lyft car or other third-party services, engage in cognitive games, report symptoms as they occur throughout the day and over the counter medications they are taking, ask questions about symptoms and medications, and so on. VOLi integrates information from EHRs, clinical ontologies, and patient-level terminology. This work will be supported by innovations in natural language understanding, deep learning, and human-computer interfaces. Our work is guided by both clinicians and researchers in human-centered computing. Our team has a history of successful interdisciplinary work in healthcare, expert systems in clinical care, EHR integration, patient monitoring and self-report, ubiquitous computing, data analytics, and field studies. This research directly supports the mission of NIA by addressing the needs of older adults to be independent in their homes and to optimize their healthcare based on the context of their symptoms and medications. VOLI will also reduce caregiving burden and optimize the interactions with healthcare and service providers.

"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,9802664,R01AG064233,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Proteins ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Transact ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' neuropathology ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ', ' amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/ftd ', ' amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration ', ' FTLD-ALS ', ' FTD/ALS ', ' Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar dementia ', ' Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia ', ' Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration ', ' ALS and FTLD ', ' ALS and FTD ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' non-demented ', ' nondemented ', ' recruit ', ' pathology imaging ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,708822,IL-01,0.04768091497608573
"Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment This project will develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) to provide cognitive training, in the form of learning to play the piano, to improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially-isolated older adults. The SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions: memory, attention, language, and social acuity. The goals of this project are that the SAR will (1) engage the persons with mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) in skill-building cognitive music training; (2) enhance cognitive functioning, in particular verbal and visual memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention; and (3) reduce feelings of loneliness. This SAR can be used as both a personalized social companion and an interactive tutor to deliver customized training for cognitive functioning and social engagement. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, roboticists, engineers, human factors specialists, neuroscientists, and gerontologists, well suited to achieve goals. Dementia is a costly chronic disease; an estimated $259 billion was spent in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, social isolation is a problem many older adults face, with 1 in 3 older adults reporting loneliness in the United States. Socially assistive robotics (SARs) have the potential to provide mental and social engagement – especially for those older adults who may lack social connections. In particular, SARs can utilize machine learning to provide customized and socially-engaging cognitive training for lonely older adults with MCI.",Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,9980524,R42AG060800,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' body language ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Engineering ', ' Esthetics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' lonely ', ' Loneliness ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Memory ', ' Moods ', ' Music ', ' Persons ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Play ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Specialist ', ' Social Network ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Companions ', ' Robot ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' visual memory ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' sensory integration ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Social Concepts ', ' Text ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' cognitive training ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cost ', ' robot assistance ', ' robotic assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' robot interface ', ' tutoring ', ' tutorial support ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' social engagement ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' efficacy study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' social assistive robot ', ' ']",NIA,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R42,2019,1999103,MN-03,0.12225628987998484
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9693819,R01NR016732,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Intelligence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Persons ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Rehabilitation Nursing ', ' Restorative Nursing ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' behavior change ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Cognitive ', ' technology validation ', ' technology implementation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' intervention effect ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' brain health ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' care costs ', ' health management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health care management ', ' health assessment ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', ' smart home ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,356218,WA-05,0.06384597401137891
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9696812,R01DA045705,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Alprazolam ', ' Alprazolan ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Baby Booms ', ' Beer ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Resources ', ' Interview ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Work ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Managed Care ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Policies ', ' Psychological Dependence ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' vehicular accident ', ' motor vehicle accident ', ' Motor carrier accident ', ' selective prevention ', ' selective preventive measure ', ' selective preventive intervention ', ' selected prevention ', ' indicated prevention ', ' prevention directed at individuals ', ' indicated preventive measure ', ' indicated preventive interventions ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' Portraits ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' fall risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' aged ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' primary care setting ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' clinical candidate ', ' rural patients ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' overdose risk ', ' benzodiazepine misuse ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,388353,MI-12,0.11213283042381172
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging (Alzheimer's Disease Supplement to 1R01AG057764-01A1) Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging (Alzheimer's Disease Supplement to 1R01AG057764-01A1),9881474,R01AG057764,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Arousal ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Censuses ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Interview ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Deception ', ' Methodology ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Persons ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Competence ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' financial decision making ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' phishing ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' brain behavior ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' cyber security ', ' internet security ', ' cybersecurity ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,380216,FL-03,0.14179816448001892
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging

"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,9766171,R01AG057764,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Censuses ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Interview ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Deception ', ' Methodology ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Persons ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Competence ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' financial decision making ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' phishing ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' brain behavior ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' cyber security ', ' internet security ', ' cybersecurity ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,322824,FL-03,0.14692889533167078
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9838988,R44AG059458,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire -

"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive

"Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults The advent of digital finance and online money management (OMM) services has changed the ways in which we conduct everyday transactions. Based on my preliminary F32 survey findings, the number of older adults who use technology is drastically growing and the way they approach financial transactions is certainly changing. Given the increasing number of older adults and corresponding diseases of aging such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the vulnerability of older adults to financial exploitation, and the pervasiveness of financial decision making in everyday life, it is critical to be able to accurately examine financial decision making using objective, quantifiable, and ecologically valid tasks that are in keeping with the current trends. In 2016, an expert panel working for the US Social Security Administration found a gap between the current assessment of financial decision making and real-world financial performance. The current proposal seeks to bridge this gap by developing and applying simulation technology-based OMM task to assess financial decision making in individuals across the spectrum of cognitive aging. Accordingly, the first two aims (K99/Mentored phase) of the current proposal are to establish the reliability and validity of a novel, simulated OMM credit card statement review task in cognitively healthy older adults via psychometrically rigorous approaches. The third and fourth inferential aims (R00 phase) are to use: (i) a longitudinal strategy to track OMM over time and in relation to cognitive changes in cognitively healthy older adults, and (ii) a cross-sectional strategy to examine OMM in two clinical groups (mild AD and those judged as financially incapable by Adult Protective Services) versus healthy older adults. To accomplish these aims, I will develop advanced skills to supplement my strong neuropsychological training, by: 1) gaining expertise in developing and conducting functional assessments using state-of-the-art technology; 2) developing a deeper knowledge of psychometric measurement to optimize task design; and 3) enriching my conceptual understanding of financial decision making while learning how to incorporate neuroeconomic principles and metacognitive assessment in financial decision making measurement. I have assembled an excellent and well-rounded mentorship team consisting of a computer scientist, biostatistician, gerontologist, economist, and expert neuropsychologists. Overall, this K99/R00 proposal enables me to lay a foundation for an independent research career focused on using technology to accurately conceptualize financial decision making in cognitively diverse older adults, a goal that is in line with the NIA’s mission to improve “the health, well-being, and independence of adults as they age”. Older adults, a wealthy segment of the population, are known to exhibit compromised financial decision making especially in the context of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. As the landscape of financial decision making has changed dramatically with rapid technological advances, there is a growing gap between the skills necessary for everyday financial decision making and the way it in which it is assessed clinically.

Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life. This project will examine how changes in the structural connections between brain regions relate to changes in cognitive abilities over time and test hypothesized health, sociodemographic, and genetic predictors of such changes.",Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging,9691831,R01AG054628,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' mortality ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Visuospatial ', ' visual spatial ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' 3 year old ', ' three years of age ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 years of age ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' network architecture ', ' cognitive performance ', ' genetic predictors ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' connectome ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,470535,TX-10,0.05443760076968244
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9749156,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mn element ', ' Manganese ', ' Hg element ', ' Mercury ', ' Metals ', ' NO3- ', ' Nitrates ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Biometals ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,708647,MA-07,-0.01996203258613288
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of

"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes.

"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,9701092,R01AG048069,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Alkaline Phosphatase ', ' glycerophosphatase ', ' alkaline phosphomonoesterase ', ' Award ', ' Body Composition ', ' bone ', ' Calcium ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Independent Living ', ' indexing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' Structural Models ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Phosphorous ', ' P element ', ' Phosphorus ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' Clinical ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' frailty ', ' calcium intake ', ' Physical Function ', ' muscle strength ', ' osteoporosis with pathological fracture ', ' Osteoporotic fracture ', ' Osteoporosis with fracture ', ' Fracture due to osteoporosis ', ' skeletal ', ' Endocrine ', ' 25-hydroxyvitamin D ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' sarcopenia ', ' sarcopenic ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' fibroblast growth factor 23 ', ' FGF23 gene product ', ' fall risk ', ' Dietary intake ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' PTH gene ', ' parathormone ', ' Parathyroid Hormone ', ' Parathyrin ', ' Address ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' sex ', ' ultraviolet ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' bone health ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' improved mobility ', ' optimized mobility ', ' mobility improvement ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Gait speed ', ' Vitamin D supplementation ', ' vitamin D supplement ', ' Supplementation with vitamin D ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2019,320457,MD-07,0.1533014262701844
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,9917201,R01AG017917,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Female ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Memory ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Persons ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E3 ', ' apoE3 ', ' apoE-3 ', ' apo E3 ', ' apo E-3 ', ' apolipoprotein E-3 ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Skin ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' therapeutic target ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' combat ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Drug Screening ', ' human model ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,2825827,IL-07,-0.0037872389682058675
"Socially-Assistive Robots for AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs (SARA) Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this Phase I Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a socially integrative and supportive robot system to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). One in 10 people 65 and older has AD, with estimates of up to as many as 5.5 million Americans currently living with AD. Because of the loss of cognitive function and subsequent changes in employment and reduced engagement with social groups and hobbies, AD/ADRD patients often experience loneliness and social isolation, and the considerable challenge of caring for these individuals often causes similar effects in caregivers. If successful, SARA will have significant impact on AD/ADRD patient care and quality of life, reducing loneliness and social isolation.  The specific aims of this two-year pilot study are to: (1) adapt commercial robot and peripheral hardware to create accessible interactions for AD/ADRD patients; (2) design and develop the robot interaction software to provide rich, supportive interaction; and (3) assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of SARA with AD/ADRD older adults and their caregivers. SARA employs user-community-driven design processes and evaluations to address key challenges surrounding how to best apply commercial robots and engaging interaction methodologies to improve AD/ADRD patient care. We will develop SARA through an iterative development process that produces and evaluates three versions of the system during the Phase I effort.  SARA is significant in three ways. SARA reduces loneliness by providing robotic social interactions. SARA reduces social isolation by connecting the patient more closely with family, friends, and caregivers, both directly and through social media. SARA provides social assistance in three ways: (1) through automated reminders and question answering for everyday information that is easily and often forgotten by patients; (2) conveyance of health regimens (e.g., What can I have for lunch? Should I still exercise today?); and (3) monitoring for caregivers.  SARA contains three central innovations. First, to create a user experience that is well tuned to the needs of patients and caregivers, SARA is created with significant feedback from AD/ADRD patients and caregivers. Second, to enable us to build on multiple robotic platforms that can meet this user experience, and to provide future extensibility, SARA features a platform-agnostic software and hardware framework that can integrate with a wide range of consumer social robots. Third, to create engaging, believable, and effective interactions with AD/ADRD patients, SARA uses and extends an AI-based architecture, Hap, which is specifically designed to create socially engaging interactive characters and robots that provide enjoyable and stimulating interactions. Project Narrative  As many as 5.5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, eventually impairing the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) is a socially integrative and supportive robot to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD).

"Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science” annual meetings to be offered each August/September from 2019 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data. This is ultimately expected to lead to a better molecular understanding of the aging process and to novel approaches for the improvement of human healthspan and/or lifespan.",Systems Biology of Aging:

"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study.

"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9768245,UH3NS100599,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' data sharing ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' protective factors ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' in vivo testing ', ' pathology imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2019,1152217,IL-07,-0.029606886594790233
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9785384,K08HS024558,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2019,158220,WI-02,0.06773998334434186
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9750581,R01AG059729,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Body Composition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare Project Summary/Abstract Family members with a relative with dementia often face complex, and stressful life situations that many other caregivers do not. Multiple factors make the adjustment to the caregiving role particularly hard, as the caregiver balances this role with other demands, including child rearing, careers, and relationships. For people with dementia, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and previously acquired knowledge are generally limited, making it difficult to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information. Tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently and an inability to remember events that occurred only a few days, hours, or even minutes previously makes day-to-day decision-making and navigating built environments difficult. The recall of routes and tasks may be unpredictable, therefore caregivers are often left with the constant and repetitive responsibility of prompting and cueing the care recipient, leading to additional stress in their caregiving role. This project aims to develop a low-cost wearable device to improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, and potentially create a new paradigm to provide assistance and care to individuals with dementia in a home environment. This innovative cognitive assistive technology, called CATcare, will be specifically designed to provide two-way assistance to the dementia caregiver and care recipient dyad living at home, enabling the individual with dementia more independence and situational awareness in the home setting, as well as improving his or her quality of life with less reliance on the caregiver. Caregivers, on the other hand, will be able to fully program, adjust, and customize the system for a given living environment according to the care recipient’s current habits, needs and conditions. This device can potentially prolong the period that the dementia patients stay at home and age in place, reducing the financial burden to both government and individuals as well as emotional and physical stress to caregivers. The proposed CATcare prototype not only encapsulates the newest hardware innovations (including smartglass and smartphone) but also advanced software solutions (including state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, computer vision techniques). In conclusion, this project will lead to the integration and development of an affordable, portable and versatile wearable intervention to address the long-standing and fast-growing challenges facing current and future dementia homecare. For individuals with dementia living at home, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently, leading to the responsibility of repetitive prompting and cueing by the caregiver. To improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, we propose to create an innovative wearable technology called CATcare which will be designed to provide navigational and cueing assistance to care recipients in the home environment.

"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9791132,R01AG053163,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' Industry ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Jordan ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Paper ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' statistics ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' family structure ', ' social ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' active method ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' diet and exercise ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' psychoeducational intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' psychoeducational ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' education research ', ' recruit ', ' aging and technology ', ' ']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,587119,NY-12,0.1437080099778258
"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system. We propose 2 linked and innovative randomized trials to evaluate a novel intervention that promotes and enhances goals-of-care discussions for hospitalized patients with serious chronic illness.

"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,9734172,K23MH116105,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Consultations ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Feedback ', ' geropsychopharmacology ', ' geropsychology ', ' geropsychiatry ', ' geriatric psychology ', ' Psychogeriatrics ', ' Psychiatry for the elderly ', ' Psychiatry for seniors ', ' Psychiatry for older people ', ' Psychiatry for older adults ', ' Geriatric Psychiatry ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Matched Group ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visual attention ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' research study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' self reported behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' extrastriate ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' biosignature ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' sustained attention ', ' learning community ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' recruit ', ' Opioid user ', ' Opioid drug user ', ' Opiate user ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2019,190488,NY-12,0.04206281604578894
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9729082,R01MH111265,"['absorption ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Consultations ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' Gliosis ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Head ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heating ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' magnetic field ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' neuropathology ', ' mood dysfunction ', ' mood disturbance ', ' mood and affect disturbance ', ' mood alteration ', ' disturbance in affect ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vascular depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,600019,PA-18,0.10986810244554147
"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups.

"Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science The central goal of this proposed Roybal Center is to develop, test, and implement novel interventions that bridge the dramatic gap between the supply of and need for palliative care services among persons with dementia (PWD) living in long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, as well as their family caregivers. Several innovative aspects of this proposed Center position us to succeed in this challenging but increasingly important space. First, we have assembled a team comprising more 50 investigators and staff from 5 schools within the University of Pennsylvania, and the most accomplished investigators of palliative approaches to care for PWD from 11 peer institutions. These investigators possess content knowledge and tremendous expertise in leading all Stages of behavioral intervention development as defined by the NIH Stage Model. Second, we will support these behavioral scientists by linking them with Center faculty with expertise in several key methodologic areas including behavioral economics, data science, statistics, qualitative methods, health policy and economics, and implementation science. Our focus on translating behavioral economic insights to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers involved in the care of PWD builds on our recent success using similar approaches to improve palliative care delivery in outpatient and hospital settings. Our focus on using machine learning, natural language processing, and network methods will enable us to (a) identify mechanisms of clinician behavior that account for aggressive care for PWD, (b) identify PWD with the greatest unmet palliative care needs so as to sustainably target intervention delivery, and (c) more efficiently measure person-centered outcomes in the context of large, pragmatic trials of the most promising interventions. Third, this Center is being launched in partnership with Genesis HealthCare, the nation's largest owner of LTSS facilities, with 401 nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the U.S. These facilities provide ideal settings within which to develop and test interventions that will be effective and sustainable in the real world. Further, by developing and testing the interventions in these settings, while continually increasing our collaborations with other owners of LTSS facilities, we will be ideally positioned to implement effective interventions in the places in which the majority of Americans with dementia are cared for near the end of life. This Center will be directed by a Steering Committee, and will include a Management and Administrative Core housed within Penn's existing Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heart ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Motion ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Social Psychology ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Measurement ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' novel ', ' Study Subject ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' fall risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' standard measure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' efficacy testing ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' cognitive load ', ' cognitive burden ', ' treadmill ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,VT-00,0.03380343318365348

"Exploring the neural substrates of age-related cognitive decline in patients with knee osteoarthritis Abstract Both aging and chronic pain have a pronounced impact on the brain. Thus, the interplay of chronic pain, aging, and the brain may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline and dementia. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disorder among the elderly population. Two recent studies with large sample sizes found that that knee OA was associated with a significantly increased risk for dementia. Nevertheless, why knee OA is associated with high dementia risk remains unknown. Taking advantage of the NCCIH / NIH funded project (R33 AT009310) on brain mechanisms of acupuncture and imagined acupuncture treatment of knee OA, this ancillary application will allow us to expand our research on cognitive decline in patients with knee OA. Specifically, with the support of new funding, we will 1) add a cohort of heathy controls (50 age- and gender-matched controls without knee OA), 2) collect blood samples to assess inflammation markers, and 3) add cognitive measurements, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), to assess the cognitive function of both knee OA patients and controls. With newly collected data, we will combine machine learning methods and multimodality neuroimaging techniques to 1) calculate neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ and compare the predicted age difference (PAD, difference between brain age and chronological age) between the knee OA patients and matched controls; 2) investigate the inflammation markers and brain structure and function (on cognition-related brain areas/networks) differences between the knee OA patients and controls; and 3) explore the association between inflammation markers, PAD, brain function and structure, and cognitive function as determined by MoCA score, as well as the modulation effect of alternative treatments on the above measurements. Relevance to Alzheimer’s disease and/or its Related to Dementia and  Narrative The aim of this ancillary application is to collect additional data to investigate the interplay between knee osteoarthritis, cognitive decline, and the brain.

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems.

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9928376,R01AG053163,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' indexing ', ' Industry ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Jordan ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Paper ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' statistics ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' family structure ', ' social ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' diet and exercise ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' psychoeducational intervention ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' psychoeducational ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' education research ', ' recruit ', ' aging and technology ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,736726,NY-12,0.1437080099778258
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9934286,R01NR016732,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Early Intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Restorative Nursing ', ' Rehabilitation Nursing ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' behavior change ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' technology implementation ', ' technology validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' usability ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention effect ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Analytics ', ' brain health ', ' Preventative health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' care costs ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' health assessment ', ' age in place ', ' aging in place ', ' smart home ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,354490,WA-05,0.06384597401137891
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9879630,R01DA045705,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Alprazolam ', ' Alprazolan ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Baby Booms ', ' Beer ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Resources ', ' Interview ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Work ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Managed Care ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' Psychological Dependence ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Motor carrier accident ', ' motor vehicle accident ', ' vehicular accident ', ' selected prevention ', ' selective preventive intervention ', ' selective preventive measure ', ' selective prevention ', ' indicated preventive interventions ', ' indicated preventive measure ', ' prevention directed at individuals ', ' indicated prevention ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Portraits ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' fall risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' aged ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' high risk ', ' primary care setting ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' clinical candidate ', ' rural patients ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' overdose risk ', ' benzodiazepine misuse ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,454065,MI-12,0.11213283042381172
"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10049339,R61AG068926,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Exercise ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' falls ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Rural ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' fall risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' individualized prevention ', ' clinically actionable ', ' exercise prescription ', ' fitness program ', ' exercise program ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' patient portal ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2020,250020,MA-07,0.08884340412827477
"Dementia Risk Prediction Pooling Project PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem which is increasing worldwide. Currently, over 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other dementias and as our population continues to age this number will increase to over 13.8 million by 2050. Great strides are being made in targeted therapies which may be able to reduce the risk for dementia. However, identifying which patients should receive these prevention interventions is currently unknown and has been identified by NINDS and experts in the field as a critical area of research. Research done by our group and others has demonstrated that risk factor levels as early in life as the 20's influence an individual's future risk for dementia. Early intervention to prevent the accumulation of risk and targeted interventions for those at high risk could help to reduce dementia risk. Risk prediction methods can be used to accurately predict who is at high risk for developing dementia and target interventions; however, current risk prediction models for dementia have several critical limitations and none have taken into account longitudinal risk factor trajectories, a critical step to implementing precision prevention approaches to identify individuals at high risk for dementia.  In this study we propose to develop the Dementia Risk Pooling Project (DRPP) by pooling and rigorously harmonizing 12 prospective observational cohorts of middle and older age adults, multiple in-person assessments of clinical, genetic and behavioral risk factors, follow-up of greater than 10 years and adjudicated dementia ascertainment. The DRPP will be completed and made available to researchers via a cloud-based computing platform as part of the R61 phase of this proposal meeting specific Go/No-Go Criteria outlined in the grant. Then, within the R33 phase of this project we will use the DRPP to develop and validate an accurate and personalized, dynamic dementia risk prediction model which incorporates longitudinal risk factor measurements and easily updates as new measurements are accrued. This tool can be used clinically to guide treatment decisions and will be made available to clinicians.

"Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment This project will develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) to provide cognitive training, in the form of learning to play the piano, to improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially-isolated older adults. The SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions: memory, attention, language, and social acuity. The goals of this project are that the SAR will (1) engage the persons with mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) in skill-building cognitive music training; (2) enhance cognitive functioning, in particular verbal and visual memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention; and (3) reduce feelings of loneliness. This SAR can be used as both a personalized social companion and an interactive tutor to deliver customized training for cognitive functioning and social engagement. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, roboticists, engineers, human factors specialists, neuroscientists, and gerontologists, well suited to achieve goals. Dementia is a costly chronic disease; an estimated $259 billion was spent in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, social isolation is a problem many older adults face, with 1 in 3 older adults reporting loneliness in the United States. Socially assistive robotics (SARs) have the potential to provide mental and social engagement – especially for those older adults who may lack social connections. In particular, SARs can utilize machine learning to provide customized and socially-engaging cognitive training for lonely older adults with MCI.",Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,9991722,R42AG060800,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' body language ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Engineering ', ' Esthetics ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Memory ', ' Moods ', ' Music ', ' Persons ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Play ', ' Robotics ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Specialist ', ' Social Network ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Companions ', ' Robot ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' psychosocial ', ' visual memory ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' sensory integration ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial support ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Social Concepts ', ' Text ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' cognitive training ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cost ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' robot assistance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' robot interface ', ' tutorial support ', ' tutoring ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' social engagement ', ' efficacy study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' social robot ', ' social assistive robot ', ' ']",NIA,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R42,2020,1981401,MN-03,0.12225628987998484
"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9984216,R01AG057679,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Transitions ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genealogy ', ' Geneologies ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Industrialization ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Policy Making ', ' Public Policy ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Urbanization ', ' War ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Data Security ', ' Family member ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' data quality ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' experience ', ' parallel processing ', ' intergenerational ', ' life history ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Population Process ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Older Population ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' health economics ', ' data integration ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' exposed to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposure to lead ', ' lead exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' economic outcome ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Social Processes ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' structured data ', ' data curation ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,675029,MN-05,0.04034803777394021
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10005106,R00AG054732,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Foundations ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Proxy ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Reporting ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' biological basis of behavior ', ' biopsychology ', ' psychobiology ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' comparative ', ' visual information ', ' healthy aging ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' information processing ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' glutamate signaling ', ' glutamatergic dendrodendritic synapses ', ' glutamatergic signaling ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' neural network ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248038,RI-01,0.02805608039892711
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk

"Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging Healthy older adults (HOA) confront complex and life-changing decisions in the face of declining neural resources. Changes in aged brains include shrinkage of neurons and their projections in several areas, such as the neocortex, hippocampus and substantia nigra.1 These age-related structural brain changes, typically measured using in vivo techniques (e.g. MRI), reflect cellular changes. Glutamate (Glu) is a key molecule in cellular metabolism, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, and the principal neurotransmitter of cortical efferents.2,3 Alterations in brain Glu likely contribute to the neural mechanisms underlying age-related declines in behavioral and cognitive functions.4 Yet, only a few studies4-11 have investigated age-related changes in brain Glu, in vivo, during healthy aging. Most of these have used standard techniques and as a result our understanding of the role that brain Glu has in typical and atypical aging remains limited. Here, I aim to fill significant gaps in the field, by 1) assessing brain Glu using a novel magnetization transfer technique—Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST)—on an ultra-high field 7T MRI scanner, enables the measurement of brain Glu across the cerebrum in humans.12; 2) assess cognitive performance using a highly sensitive computerized neurocognitive battery (Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB)); and 3) explore the possibility of aging biotypes based upon age- related changes in brain glutamate.  Here, we propose to investigate alterations in brain glutamate in 100 HOA (60-85 years of age) using GluCEST 7T MRI and relate alterations in brain Glu to age-related changes in cognitive functioning, including, memory, and executive function. Moreover, we will contrast age-related patterns with data from young adults (18-30 years of age). Finally, we leverage data from a large consortium, iSTAGING (directed by Co- Investigator Davatzikos), to employ recently developed machine-learning techniques (e.g. HYDRA13), to classify subgroups of older adults based upon unique patterns of brain structure associated with typical, atypical and resilient aging. These subtypes will be applied within our sample and patterns of brain glutamate can then be measured within these subtypes. The proposed studies will provide more specific and sensitive in vivo measurements of brain glutamate in HOA. This proposal will enable testing of specific hypothesis about the regional distribution of brain Glu, its relation to aging, and its contribution to cognitive functioning in aging. As such, these studies can provide crucial preliminary data for longitudinal studies in healthy and pathological aging by targeting a specific neural mechanism associated with cognition and disease progression. RELEVANCE Older adults tend to focus on positive emotional information more than their younger counterparts. The psychological and neural mechanisms of this positivity bias remain unclear and it is possible that an age-related reduction in executive function contribute to this bias. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the positivity bias is maintained in those at risk for developing dementia. This positivity and and  roject aims to characterize this emergence of this bias across the lifespan and determine its role in the early stages of dementia those at risk for developing dementia using computerized assessment of emotion cognition. p",Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging,10241606,R56AG066656,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ',

"Identifying Pathways Between Daily Stress and Long-Term Well-Being in Caregivers and Non-Caregivers Stressful experiences are generally thought to be harmful to mental and physical health. This perspective has guided research, informed policy, and colored the public narrative on the effects of caregiving for an impaired older adult. Indeed, many studies find greater depression, higher negative affect, and lower life satisfaction in caregivers (CGs) relative to non-caregivers (non-CGs).1,2 However, there is evidence that CGs experience positive effects despite, or perhaps because of, their stressful experiences.3 Research also finds that CGs live longer and are more resilient to perceived stress than non-CGs.4,5 Moreover, many CGs report psychological benefits like increased meaning in life, growing closer to the care recipient, and learning new skills.6,7 In a previous paper,8 the PI (Marino) suggested that these benefits reflect domains of eudaimonic well-being (EWB - meaning in life, positive relationships, personal growth, environmental mastery, autonomy, and self- acceptance) developed in positive psychology research9. Longitudinal change in EWB among CGs of impaired older adults has not yet been studied. Higher EWB has also been linked to lower reactivity to stressors,10,11 but has not been evaluated as an internal resource that promotes CGs' resilience to daily stress. The proposed project will fill these gaps by examining links between caregiving status and multiple dimensions of well-being including EWB, hedonic well-being (HWB - positive and negative affect and life satisfaction), and affective and physiological reactivity to daily stress. We will obtain a sample of propensity-matched CGs and non-CGs from the main survey of the population-based Midlife in the United States study and its daily diary study (the National Study of Daily Experiences) to identify within- and between- group differences in 1) EWB and HWB, cross- sectionally and over 20 years, and 2) exposure and reactivity to stressors over 8 days. In an exploratory aim, we will apply novel machine learning techniques to identify diverse conditions associated with typologies of optimal and sub-optimal well-being. The central hypothesis is that despite being associated with persistently lower HWB, caregiving for an impaired older adult is linked to greater increases in EWB over time. Further, longitudinal gains in EWB are predicted to weaken the association between stressor exposure and reactivity to daily stressors in CGs. The project is expected to help shift the current CG well-being paradigm by applying robust methods from developmental psychology to the caregiving context and generating novel information about how caring for an aging adult might affect well-being both negatively and positively, concurrently and over time. Findings can inform new psychological interventions that target EWB as a pathway to increasing resilience to daily stressors. The proposed training site will provide a scientific environment that is challenging and strongly supportive of the proposed project. Upon completion of the training plan, the PI will have a unique and diversified skill set for evaluating several domains of stress and well-being across time scales and will be prepared to lead future independent investigations to understand and promote positive outcomes among stress-prone adults like CGs. The proposed research will help identify both positive and negative effects of providing care to an impaired older adult and provide insight into caregivers' resilience to daily stressful experiences. As more adults become caregivers for an aging population, strategies are needed to optimize the short- and long-term effects of providing care. Thus, the proposed project is essential for the design of interventions that work towards NIA's mission of improving the health of older persons.",Identifying Pathways Between Daily Stress and Long-Term Well-Being in Caregivers and Non-Caregivers,10068660,F31AG066434,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Color ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scholarship ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Children with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped Children ', ' Disabled Children ', ' Exposure to ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Salivary ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' developmental psychology ', ' Reporting ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Characteristics ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' hedonic ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' Affective ', ' person centered ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' population based ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disturbance in affect ', ' mood alteration ', ' mood and affect disturbance ', ' mood disturbance ', ' mood dysfunction ', ' affective disturbance ', ' Personal Growth ', ' care receiver ', ' care recipients ', ' care giver well-being ', ' care giver wellbeing ', ' caregiver wellbeing ', ' Caregiver well-being ', ' care giving research ', ' research on caregiving ', ' caregiving research ', ' care giving outcome ', ' caregiving outcomes ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,F31,2020,33771,FL-14,0.07632529689539158
"A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a group of progressive, terminal illnesses that will affect an estimated 14-million people in the United States by the year 2050. Caregivers experience chronic stress and they report feeling burdened and unprepared for making difficult end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, which may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or avoidable transitions in care that affect end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL). Advance care planning (ACP), which improves EOL-QOL, is the gold-standard approach for improving concordance between preferences and actual care received at EOL. However, despite decades of research aimed at raising their rates, only 50% of those with AD/ADRD have a written ACP. Furthermore, there is a lack of current research evidence investigating the factors associated with transitions in care and EOL-QOL for persons with AD/ADRD, which could help guide EOL decision-making. To date, the state of the science is primarily cross-sectional in nature, and does not account for the influence of trajectories of decline, the effect these changes have on caregivers, nor how longitudinal changes in caregiving ultimately affect EOL care outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover new approaches for preparing persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making informed, in-the-moment decisions, to ensure high EOL-QOL care and to support appropriate transitions in care as circumstances change over time. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study on Caregiving (NSOC), we plan to use a machine learning based framework to identify the key determinants for predicting the risk for EOL care transitions and the traits of EOL-QOL among older adults residing in the community. This study has two specific aims: 1) Develop predictive model of factors related to end-of-life care transitions (e.g. inpatient death versus hospice) in persons with AD/ADRD longitudinally; and 2) Develop a predictive model of factors related to end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) in persons with AD/ADRD. Discovering knowledge in a large population- level dataset is foundational for the future development of a generalizable/scalable model for guiding persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers as they navigate a fragmented healthcare system while making difficult decisions for their loved ones. Our approach fills a critical gap between the current approaches for improving EOL-QOL and EOL transitions in care that focus on ACP as a singular outcome, by addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers that change over time. Our study will provide a predictive model for EOL-QOL and EOL care transitions. This is a critical first step for the future development of an approach for personalizing care to guide persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making EOL care decisions. These results will have an important positive impact on EOL care, which aligns with the strategic goals of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) and Nursing Research (NINR) to address clinical and translational gaps in the study of EOL care needs of people with AD/ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are at high risk for experiencing burdensome care transitions, avoidable hospitalizations, and poor end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) due to the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic illness and escalating demands placed on caregivers, resulting in significant personal and public socioeconomic burdens. Decades of research has focused on improving the rates of advance care plans above 50% among persons with AD/ADRD, however, others may benefit more from personalized guidance to help navigate the trajectory of decline that supports timely, “in the moment” medical decision making. This study addresses Goals 2 and 3 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease to enhance care quality and efficiency and expand support for persons with AD/ADRD by identifying factors related to poor EOL-QOL and care transitions in the context of caregiving for the future development of a personalized approach to support in the moment healthcare decision-making.",A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life,9958923,R03AG067159,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' phrases ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized care ', ' care giver strain ', ' caregiver strain ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' ']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R03,2020,79750,NY-26,0.022833112378414712
"Individualized Vestibular Rehabilitation for Elderly with Self-Management and Gaming Elements Project Summary/Abstract: Vestibular rehabilitation has been proven to be effective in reducing dizziness and falls in older adults, but patient adherence is a major problem. Recent research shows that less than half of patients complete their rehabilitation. Some of the main reasons for this are the numerous visits that are required and accessibility. In particular for older individuals who experience dizziness and/or falls, it may be difficult to travel to attend rehabilitation sessions. Additionally, rehabilitation programs become expensive in terms of equipment and health professional’s time. Programs may also not be available to all who may benefit because of geographical limitations. Previous research has shown that remote monitoring and gaming elements have great potential to solve these issues, even in an older population. However, current solutions are generic and effectiveness can be inconsistent. The overall goal of this project is to develop a vestibular rehabilitation app to be used by older adults at home. The app will improve adherence through gaming, self-management, and remote monitoring. Patients will use low-cost sensors placed on their bodies (head and waist) to play the games on the app. This allows simultaneous monitoring of patient progress while performing the exercises. This data can be shared with a clinician via email or the cloud, allowing the patient to perform the rehabilitation at their home and the clinician to monitor how well the patients performed their exercises. The vestibular rehabilitation components are packaged in a phone and tablet app that is easy to navigate for older individuals and has a modular design that allows individualized rehabilitation. By improving patient engagement and enjoyment, rehabilitation adherence should be improved as well. Phase I demonstrated feasibility of this approach. In Phase II, games will be added to cover a full at-home rehabilitation session and improve usability of the app. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be developed to provide real-time feedback if exercises are performed incorrectly. This ensures patients will perform their exercises correctly when at home. As in Phase I, clinical collaborators will provide continued guidance and testing throughout development to ensure clinical relevance and promote adoption during commercialization. This project uses a novel approach in that it develops rehabilitation games specifically designed for vestibular rehabilitation through a mobile app tailored for an older population. Current gaming approaches for rehabilitation typically use existing or commercial games. The use of sensors for remote monitoring is also novel in this area and allows patients to perform rehabilitation at their home, while being monitored by a clinician. This project is therefore likely to have a high clinical impact. It will advance clinical practice, make vestibular rehabilitation more accessible to older individuals, and help adherence to programs. Successful implementation of this program will reduce falls and improve quality of life of for patients. Project Narrative: The overall goal of this project is to develop an app for older individuals that will improve accessibility of vestibular rehabilitation and that will improve compliance compared to current rehabilitation programs. The proposed effort uses a novel approach that combines low-cost inertial sensors and machine learning algorithms with mobile device technology to measure performance, provide real-time feedback, and present data in a comprehensible way to the clinician via email or the cloud, removing the patients’ need to travel for rehabilitation sessions. These features are packaged in an app that is appropriate for and appealing to older users to improve compliance, and uses novel gaming elements specifically developed for vestibular rehabilitation rather than repurposing existing commercial games designed for younger users and entertainment.",Individualized Vestibular Rehabilitation for Elderly with Self-Management and Gaming Elements,10011222,R44DC017408,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dizziness ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Equipment ', ' Exercise ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Kansas ', ' Literature ', ' Motion ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Records ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Safety ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Supervision ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Self Management ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' gaze ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Performance ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' remote sensor ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical practice ', ' rehabilitation science ', ' physical rehab ', ' Physical Rehabilitation ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' rehabilitative exercise ', ' exercise rehabilitation ', ' physiotherapist ', ' physical therapist ', ' patient engagement ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' motion sensor ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIDCD,CFD RESEARCH CORPORATION,R44,2020,680368,AL-05,-0.005658802001553971
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9995038,UH3NS100599,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' data sharing ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' MRI biomarker ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' protective factors ', ' in vivo testing ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' pathology imaging ', ' injury to tissue ', ' tissue injury ', ' religious order study ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2020,1159758,IL-07,-0.029606886594790233
"Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This is a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award submitted to the National Institute on Aging by Yongkang Zhang, a Research Associate in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). Dr. Zhang’s career goal is to become an independent researcher on improving care for the elderly through developing and applying effective prediction tools to identify older adults with complex conditions and high healthcare needs. This K99/R00 application will provide Dr. Zhang with the necessary training 1) to understand the complexity and characteristics of high-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults; 2) to develop a prediction model for HNHC adults using machine learning methods; and 3) to test the performance of the machine learning-based model with three commonly used, patient-risk prediction tools.  Dr. Zhang has assembled a mentor team of accomplished researchers across multiple divisions and departments at Weill Cornell Medical College: Dr. Rainu Kaushal (primary mentor) who is the Nanette Laitman Distinguished Professor and an expert on the HNHC patients and health data science; Dr. Lawrence Casalino (co-mentor) who is the Livingston Farrand Professor of Public Health and an expert on characteristics of and healthcare delivery for HNHC patients; Dr. Mark Lachs (co-mentor) who is a Professor of Geriatrics and prac- ticing geriatrician and an expert on the complexity and healthcare needs of older adults; Dr. Yuhua Bao (co- mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Healthcare Policy and Research and expert on behavioral health conditions and prescription data; Dr. Fei Wang (co-mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Health Informat- ics and an expert on machine learning methods; and Dr. James Flory (consultant) who is an Assistant Profes- sor of Healthcare Policy and Research and practicing clinician and an expert on medication use.  HNHC older adults are small group of patients representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utili- zation. These patients are more likely to experience preventable quality and safety problems due to their fre- quent interactions with health systems. Caring for HNHC older adults provides great potential benefits for qual- ity improvement and cost reduction. However, the benefits are unlikely to be realized unless these patients can be correctly identified and targeted. Building on his previous research and training on developing a claims data-based taxonomy for HNHC Medicare patients, Dr. Zhang’s research will understand the characteristics of HNHC older adults and develop predictors for these patients using clinical and prescription data (Aim 1), de- velop a machine learning-based prediction model for HNHC older adults (Aim 2), and compare the perfor- mance of the prediction model with three commonly used, patient risk prediction tools (Aim 3). This research will be the foundation for an R01 grant application that will incorporate this prediction model into healthcare de- livery process and identify the optimal ways to inform opportunities for improvement in healthcare delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE High-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults are a small group of individuals representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utilization and experiencing preventable quality and safety problems. Improving care for HNHC older adults is challenging because of their complex medical, behavioral, and social conditions and the instability of their healthcare utilization. Developing a prediction model for HNHC older adults could better inform patient-centered clinical decision-making, help target quality improvement interventions, and prioritize the allocation of scarce healthcare resources.","Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults",9977380,K99AG064030,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Award ', ' Calibration ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' performance tests ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Policy Research ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' effective intervention ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' clinical risk ', ' Patient risk ', ' health data ', ' associate faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' midcareer faculty ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' distinguished professor ', ' Data Science ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' random forest ', ' multilayer perceptron ', ' social vulnerability ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2020,125185,NY-12,0.10757217451789797
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9829517,R01AG057704,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Demography ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Hand ', ' Handwriting ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Marriage ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sanitation ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Toxin ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' health knowledge ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Maiden ', ' Maiden Name ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' population health ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' early-life nutrition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' data infrastructure ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,307227,MI-12,0.0524482491119047
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,10018624,R01AG017917,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Female ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Memory ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E-3 ', ' apo E-3 ', ' apo E3 ', ' apoE-3 ', ' apoE3 ', ' apolipoprotein E3 ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Skin ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' therapeutic target ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' combat ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' sharing hub ', ' data hub ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Drug Screening ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,3035766,IL-07,-0.0037872389682058675
"Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity Project Summary In a well-received preprint, the investigator identified through unbiased analysis of own and published datasets that during aging, and infection of the lung with influenza A, there is a progressive imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. Failure of gene expression homeostasis impacts the rheostatic ability of almost all cellular processes implicated in aging impairing organ function, particularly in response to systemic stress. Transcriptome imbalance could account for manifestations of aging through several potential mechanisms, including: 1) The dysregulation of individual genes, 2) A dysregulation of the stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes, 3) A relative upregulation of short early-response inflammatory genes, 4) A breakdown of the coordination between molecular pathways and processes encoded by genes of different lengths and 5) A reduction in the capacity of protein homeostasis and cell stress responses to respond towards external stimuli by sequestering its activity toward a buffering of transcriptome imbalance. The investigator will test the hypothesis that during aging transcriptome imbalance globally interferes with the functions encoded by the genome and contributes to the loss of resilience in older individuals. To address this fundamental question, he will focus on innovative mammalian ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo models of age-dependent transcriptome imbalance, and machine-learning approaches. Reflecting the interdisciplinary character, he will work under the supervision of his main mentor Dr. Amaral, a network scientist and data- scientist, and his co-mentor Dr. Morimoto, a molecular biologist studying protein homeostasis and aging. Further marking his transition to independence, he will be mentored by Dr. Budinger, an immunologist studying changes in immune aging, and Dr. McNally, a geneticist and bioinformatician, which is not part of a project grant of his mentors. Aim 1 (K99): To determine whether SFPQ regulates transcriptome imbalance in aging. Aim 2 (K99): To determine whether adaptive changes in proteostasis buffer transcriptome imbalance during aging after influenza A pneumonia. Aim 3 (R00): To causally link transcriptome imbalance to the age-related susceptibility to influenza A pneumonia. Importantly, the investigator’s mentoring committee has a very strong track record of training postdoctoral fellows in transitioning into independent investigators. He will engage in seminars and learn recent experimental techniques, grant writing, bioethics training, and training on running a laboratory, and obtain additional off-site training on the biology of aging in mice with the purpose to facilitate collaborations. Combining the new skills learned during his K99 mentored phase with his prior expertise in data science and transcriptomics will ensure a strong technical foundation to launch an independent laboratory on gene expression homeostasis in aging and the mechanisms underlying multi-system dysfunction. Project Narrative The ability to sustain gene expression homeostasis, is one of the most integral parts of cellular biology but declines with age. In a well-received preprint, the project investigator discovered that most organs of 24 months old mice, and lungs infected with influenza A, display a genome-wide imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. This project will address the regulation of this transcriptome imbalance and its impact on the functional health of the proteome and the multi-morbidity in aged individuals.",Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity,10040210,K99AG068544,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Buffers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Glutamine ', ' Gln ', ' L-Glutamine ', ' Q Levoglutamide ', ' Q.

"Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI. Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging. Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals. To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease. The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscience—and more hope for UUI sufferers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Urge urinary incontinence is a common problem in older people which vastly reduces quality of life, yet the cause and mechanism of disease are not well understood. This study will characterize brain control of the bladder in young and old continent individuals and age-matched wet counterparts. This will expand our current knowledge of how the brain controls the bladder, better characterize the `ideal' mechanism and suggest ways in which we can better target treatment.",Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging,10050097,R01AG065288,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Incontinence ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spasm ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Woman ', ' micturition urgency ', ' Urgency to pass urine ', ' Urgent desire to urinate ', ' urinary urgency ', ' urination urgency ', ' Mediating ', ' Urge Incontinence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Medial ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Pre-Menopause ', ' Pre-menopausal Period ', ' Premenopausal ', ' Premenopausal Period ', ' pre-menopausal ', ' Premenopause ', ' Failure ', ' Bladder Dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' bladder continence ', ' micturition control ', ' urinary continence ', ' urinary control ', ' urination control ', ' Bladder Control ', ' age group ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' voiding reflex ', ' Micturition Reflex ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,624134,PA-18,0.041259819617866664
"G-quadruplex DNA in senescence of the neurovascular unit Project Summary The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional structure that consists of endothelial cells, surrounded by an extracellular matrix, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes. The NVU enables regulation of regional cerebral blood flow and nutrient delivery to the brain tissue. With aging, a structural weakening of the NVU occurs, which is also associated with inflammatory signaling and transport deficiencies. Critically, it is not clear how neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells undergo senescence in the NVU, and whether there are differences in senescence pathways between healthy NVU aging and NVU in Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The G-quadruplex (G4) is a non-canonical DNA secondary structure formed by four DNA strands containing multiple runs of guanines. G4s play important roles in DNA recombination, replication, and regulation of transcription. In our data, we demonstrated that brain samples from aged mice contain more G4s than that of young mice. We showed that mice treated with a small-molecule G4 stabilizer develop cognitive impairment and accelerated brain aging. Using a heterochronic parabiosis mouse model, we also showed that the levels of G4s are decreased in the brain of old parabiont, compared to the age-matched iso-parabiotic mice, implicating presence of rejuvenating factors that can reverse the elevation of G4s with aging. The effect of the old parabiont on the young partner is more pronounced (more G4s in the young), suggesting a strong negative influence of aging factors. Importantly, in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrated that G4s are stabilized in the brains, well before the deposition of amyloid occurs. We hypothesize that these converging lines of evidence point at а mechanism of senescence. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed studies is to investigate G4-associated cellular senescence in the NVU, in aging and AD. In Aim 1, we will compare G4s across cell types in the NVU. In Aim 2, we will determine whether G4s preferentially accumulate in the NVUs of brain regions most vulnerable to neurodegeneration. In Aim 3, we will investigate how a peripheral factor, CXCL10, contributes to NVU's G4 senescence. G4s might be a novel pathway that can be targeted to mitigate the detrimental effects of cellular senescence in the brain. Project Narrative Senescent cells accumulate in aging and drive deficits accompanying age-associated diseases. This project investigates the role of a novel nuclear pathway, the G-quadruplex (G4) DNA pathway, in senescence of neurovascular unit (NVU) in the brain. The formation of G4 DNA is associated with chromatin remodeling, transcriptional changes, and DNA damage; we hypothesize that stabilization of G4s leads to senescence of the components of the NVU -

"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive

"Voice2Connect: Informing the Design of Smart Speakers for Social Connectedness in Low-Income Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract There is a growing public health concern regarding the high risk of social isolation and loneliness among low- income older adults and its resulting impact on their longevity and overall well-being. The issue of social isolation is particularly relevant to low-income senior housing (LISH) residents who often have multiple chronic conditions and disabilities, lack of financial and social resources, and limited social networks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop innovative approaches to mitigate these issues in older adults living in LISH. Voice- operated smart speakers have the potential to reduce social isolation and loneliness in this population, for example, by connecting with other people, sending a reminder about social activities, or providing a conversational agent. The hands-free voice control provides improved accessibility and usability for people with low literacy, vision impairment, mobility limitation, or poor dexterity issues. We propose to examine how smart speakers can support the needs of social connectedness among older adults living alone in LISH. We will use an iterative user-centered design and employ a mixed-methods approach, incorporating participatory methods, focus group interviews, and functional and psychosocial health questionnaires. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine experiences of social isolation, user needs, user context, and preferences related to the use of smart speakers for social connectedness in the LISH setting, (2) to evaluate older adults (smart speaker users and non-users)’ and stakeholders’ attitudes towards the in-home use of smart speakers for promoting social engagement, with a focus on perceived usability and usefulness of the technology, and (3) to identify potential implementation barriers and privacy concerns among older adults and stakeholders. Stakeholders will include housing staff members (N=10) and health care professionals (N=6) providing wellness services to LISH residents. Older adults (N=36) will form six focus groups and take part in a series of three focus group sessions in which they participate in user-centered design activities to identify potential smart speaker features that can support the needs of social connectedness. Their thoughts and ideas will be used to develop low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios of use for each prototype. After prototype and scenario development, we will seek input from the older adults, housing staff, and health care providers through focus groups, which will be used to refine the prototype. The refined prototypes will be validated with the older adult participants. We will use a thematic analysis and inductive coding method to analyze focus group interview transcripts. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the questionnaire data collected from older adults and stakeholders. Findings from this study will inform our future research where we build smart speaker algorithms and functionalities that can facilitate the planning of innovative smart speaker-based social connectedness interventions for older adults in LISH. Project Narrative The proposed study aims to examine how smart speaker technologies can support the needs for social connectedness among older adults living alone in low-income senior housing communities. This study is highly relevant to public health as it represents an early exploration of what potential features and functionalities of smart speakers can address the issue of social isolation and loneliness in low-income senior housing residents.

"Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults The advent of digital finance and online money management (OMM) services has changed the ways in which we conduct everyday transactions. Based on my preliminary F32 survey findings, the number of older adults who use technology is drastically growing and the way they approach financial transactions is certainly changing. Given the increasing number of older adults and corresponding diseases of aging such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the vulnerability of older adults to financial exploitation, and the pervasiveness of financial decision making in everyday life, it is critical to be able to accurately examine financial decision making using objective, quantifiable, and ecologically valid tasks that are in keeping with the current trends. In 2016, an expert panel working for the US Social Security Administration found a gap between the current assessment of financial decision making and real-world financial performance. The current proposal seeks to bridge this gap by developing and applying simulation technology-based OMM task to assess financial decision making in individuals across the spectrum of cognitive aging. Accordingly, the first two aims (K99/Mentored phase) of the current proposal are to establish the reliability and validity of a novel, simulated OMM credit card statement review task in cognitively healthy older adults via psychometrically rigorous approaches. The third and fourth inferential aims (R00 phase) are to use: (i) a longitudinal strategy to track OMM over time and in relation to cognitive changes in cognitively healthy older adults, and (ii) a cross-sectional strategy to examine OMM in two clinical groups (mild AD and those judged as financially incapable by Adult Protective Services) versus healthy older adults. To accomplish these aims, I will develop advanced skills to supplement my strong neuropsychological training, by: 1) gaining expertise in developing and conducting functional assessments using state-of-the-art technology; 2) developing a deeper knowledge of psychometric measurement to optimize task design; and 3) enriching my conceptual understanding of financial decision making while learning how to incorporate neuroeconomic principles and metacognitive assessment in financial decision making measurement. I have assembled an excellent and well-rounded mentorship team consisting of a computer scientist, biostatistician, gerontologist, economist, and expert neuropsychologists. Overall, this K99/R00 proposal enables me to lay a foundation for an independent research career focused on using technology to accurately conceptualize financial decision making in cognitively diverse older adults, a goal that is in line with the NIA’s mission to improve “the health, well-being, and independence of adults as they age”. Older adults, a wealthy segment of the population, are known to exhibit compromised financial decision making especially in the context of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. As the landscape of financial decision making has changed dramatically with rapid technological advances, there is a growing gap between the skills necessary for everyday financial decision making and the way it in which it is assessed clinically. Given the precipitous, ongoing and projected increase in the number of older adults and their use of technology, it is imperative to develop financial decision making measures that approximate real world functioning in the current technological culture that can inform clinical determination of financial decision making abilities, and shape public policies aimed at minimizing financial losses.",Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults,9902295,K99AG062783,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Policy ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Respondent ', ' Review Literature ', ' Social Security Administration ', ' United States Social Security Administration ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' exhaustion ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' Transact ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' alertness ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' financial decision making ', ' neuroeconomics ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' financial exploitation ', ' user-friendly ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' E-course ', ' online curriculum ', ' online course ', ' rate of change ', ' financial literacy ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,132227,NY-13,0.09512319950472413
"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,9941142,K23MH116105,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Consultations ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Feedback ', ' Geriatric Psychiatry ', ' Psychiatry for older adults ', ' Psychiatry for older people ', ' Psychiatry for seniors ', ' Psychiatry for the elderly ', ' Psychogeriatrics ', ' geriatric psychology ', ' geropsychiatry ', ' geropsychology ', ' geropsychopharmacology ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Matched Group ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visual attention ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' Elderly depression ', ' late life depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' self reported behavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' extrastriate ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biosignature ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Positive Valence ', ' sustained attention ', ' learning community ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' recruit ', ' Opiate user ', ' Opioid drug user ', ' PWUO ', ' patients who use opioids ', ' people who use opioids ', ' persons who use opioids ', ' opioid user ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2020,190430,NY-12,0.04206281604578894
"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10056750,R21AG065753,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Awareness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Medication Errors ', ' medication administration errors ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Services ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Management ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' patient home care ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' home healthcare agencies ', ' Home Health Care Agencies ', ' Funding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Nursing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Medicare claim ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' study population ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' unstructured data ', "" Alzheimer's patient "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", ' ']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2020,260660,NY-12,-0.0003056095445042758
"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10044799,R01AG068338,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ',

"Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of Elderly Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia The objective of the proposed direct Phase-II SBIR project is to develop and study and the effectiveness of Serious Games and physical Activities played/performed by elderly people with Alzheimer’s disease and AD- related Dementias in interaction with Ryan, our successfully piloted Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). Ryan is an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with AD/ADRD. Ryan uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology for automated facial expression recognition, natural language processing, and tracking of human body that are used in personalization and adaptation of the games and physical activities. According to the Alzheimer’s Association an estimated 5.7 million Americans have AD and is projected to rise to 13.8 million, as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. While SAR research prototypes exist that can interact with users playing physical cognitive games equipped with artificial intelligence technology and personalization, to our knowledge, no such cooperative SAR (prototype or commercial) for electronic gameplay with individuals suffering from dementia exists today. Our game designs will target “Cognition”, “Memory”, “Spatial Relation”, “Social Relationship”, and “Motor Skills” abilities of players. We will conduct a pilot study to measure Ryan’s effectiveness in mental and socio- emotional stimulation of users with mild dementia. This innovative technology stands to produce significant financial savings and improve the quality of life of individuals living with AD/ADRD, their families, and caregivers. The goal of the project is to develop serious games and physical activities co-played by a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,10007879,K08HS024558,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2020,156859,WI-02,0.06773998334434186
"India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health ABSTRACT Our revised proposal launches the India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health - a globally coordinated study of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), created response to the NIH FOA: Global Brain and Nervous System Disorders Research Across the Lifespan (R01; PAR-18-834; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-835.html). Our overall goal is to identify predictive markers in the blood, genome, and epigenome that influence brain aging in India, to better understand prognosis, and to support personalized risk evaluations on each continent. We plan to identify etiological pathways to resilience using the rich biobanking strategy developed by our partners at NIMHANS in India. To do this, we will leverage our global consortium, ENIGMA (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu), to partner with dementia research pioneers in India, creating new links between international biobanks, and building research capacity. By 2020, 70% of the world's population over age 60 will live in developing countries, with 14% in India (Mathuranath 2012). Recently, attention has been drawn to a “diversity” crisis in brain research, as most brain research is conducted in Caucasian populations from relatively wealthy backgrounds (LeWinn 2017). This lack of ethnic diversity means that: (1) we do not know if predictors of health (and disease) generalize to other ethnic groups, and (2) we fail to collect vital data that could teach us how AD progresses in populations with different genetic and environmental backgrounds. Our coordinated analyses in US/EU and Indian biobanks will help identify brain aging predictors specific to India and those that are universal. Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Create Lifespan Charts of brain aging Trajectories in India using MRI, DWI and Resting State Functional MRI. Aim 2. Identify Blood and Epigenetic Markers that Predict Brain Aging and AD in India. Aim 3. Using a combination of multimodal imaging, blood markers, and clinical data to predict clinical decline in India. We test structural equation models that hypothesize how brain aging depends on lifestyle and psychosocial factors (diet, family support, drug abuse, literacy, sleep, and depression), as well as sex, education, and AD genetic risk. With novel machine learning methods, will analyze blood markers and plasma proteomic analytes, to define processes that are harmful to brain aging. In Capacity Building Aims, we will leverage ENIGMA's successful strategies to train emerging and established scientists in India to analyze their data with high quality control and precision, with targeted biostatistical and imaging workshops to bolster capacity. This collaborative India-US initiative will enable future science initiatives, and equip the NIMHANS team with the necessary tools to train new scientists and independently conduct high impact research bridging efforts into numerous international partnerships.

"Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.  In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.  The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research will promote the public health of more than 15 million Americans who serve as family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. It will assess whether stress reduction therapy incorporating guided imagery practices that promote perspective taking and empathy can improve the effects of family caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone. It will also test the feasibility of using smartphone estimated markers to track caregiver insomnia and stress, which could eventually help reduce caregiver suffering and healthcare costs by identifying early warning signs of treatment failure and symptomatic worsening.","Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot

"Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19 Project Summary. As of April 30, 2020, over 1 million individuals in the U.S. have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with COVID-19 may develop various symptoms – while the majority of patients have mild symptoms, some require hospitalization, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and may die. To date, there is only limited knowledge on risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. First, older adults have been found to have higher risks of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized or die. Studies have suggested that some underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, are associated with the severity of COVID-19. However, it is unknown to what extent these comorbidities explain the variation in the severity of COVID-19, whether older age is independently associated with the severity of COVID-19; and whether and how older age modifies the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Second, it has been reported that black Americans experienced a higher rate of COVID-related hospitalization and were more likely to die of COVID- 19, compared to white Americans. However, it is unknown what may contribute to such racial difference – whether it is due to the differences in health conditions between blacks and whites, or due to the characteristics of the community where they reside in, or due to some other factors that are also associated with race. The objective of this study is to identify individual risk factors that are associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalizations, ICU use and death), especially among older adults, and to understand reasons that may contribute to racial differences in COVID-19 severity. To achieve these goals, we will use the daily- updated national Veterans Affairs (VA) data, which contain rich individual-level information on veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. As of April 30, 2020, almost 9,000 veterans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and about 500 had died, thus providing a large study cohort. This proposed study has two Specific Aims:1) To identify individual risk factors that are associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations, ICU use and mortality, to understand the role of older age in COVID-19 severity, and to build a predictive model for COVID- 19 severity by machine learning; and 2) To examine reasons for racial differences in illness severity among veterans diagnosed with COVID-19: whether and how such difference is related to individual factors and community characteristics, especially socio-economic status. This study is innovative because it will be the first study to examine the role of multiple risk factors in the severity of COVID-19 by using national data with detailed individual-level information and machine learning algorithm; and it will be the first to examine the reasons, including the role of social determinants, for racial differences in COVID-19 severity. This proposed research is significant as it will help to identify patients with the highest-risk phenotypes, thus providing insights into disease prevention and resource allocation. Project Narrative: This proposed research aims to understand risks factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalization, ICU use and death) and the role of older age in the severity of COVID-19; and to examine reasons leading to racial differences in the severity of COVID-19. This proposed research is highly relevant to public health because the findings from this study will help target prevention strategies and allocation of resources to high-risk populations and help fight this novel infectious disease.","Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19",10159581,RF1AG063811,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' male ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Virus ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' health administration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' fighting ', ' Severities ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel virus ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' parent grant ', ' high risk ', ' study population ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,RF1,2020,578879,NY-25,0.0018733495546473555
"Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision Abstract The outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 virus has exasperated the vulnerability of dementia spousal caregivers, as well as those with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. SARS-Cov-2 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory problems and even death. Older adults and people of all ages with underlying comorbidities are considered to be at “high-risk” for severe illness from COVID-19. During this pandemic, dementia spousal caregivers are tasked with the burden of keeping their spouse safe from getting sick and even dying from COVID- 19, while simultaneously performing their typical caregiving responsibilities. The vast majority of dementia spousal caregivers and their spouses with dementia are over sixty-five years of age, the age bracket that puts people at most risk for COVID-19 disease complications and mortality. Social distancing guidelines make up a large proportion of the current prevention recommendations; thus, loneliness and other negative emotions will likely be frequent and more intense than usual. The proposed competitive revision builds upon the primary aims of the parent grant (R01AG062690) by using attachment theory as an overarching theoretical framework to understand dementia spousal caregiver risk and resilience in light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 disease). The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PA-18-935, NOT-AG-20-022. Capitalizing on the dementia spousal caregivers who will take part in the parent study, we propose to collect additional data for one week each month for three months. We will collect this data using ecological momentary assessment methods, while passively assessing location, activity, autonomic activity, and sleep via smartphone and smartwatch technology. We aim to understand how emotions, assessed in real-time in the natural environment, affect the extent to which AD spousal caregivers adaptively navigate the challenges associated COVID-19. We will also aim to determine how relatively stable individual difference patterns that originate from people’s close relationship histories (i.e., attachment orientations) inform risk and resilience. As an exploratory high risk/high reward aim, we will evaluate if dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches can incorporate passively collected information (i.e., location, heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, sleep) with information that we learn from our primary aims, to yield a detailed and sophisticated understanding of real-world dynamics that predict three critical COVID-19 specific outcomes: social distancing adherence, social distancing self-efficacy, and caregiver self-efficacy. By understanding patterns of risk and resilience, intervention scientists will be better able to identify at-risk AD spousal caregivers. The proposed research would advance our understanding of how AD spousal caregivers can reduce illness exposure for themselves and those they care for in perhaps the most comprehensive, detailed, real-time, real-world investigation of social distancing in AD spousal caregivers to date. Narrative By identifying the factors that impede social distancing behaviors and impair a dementia spousal caregiver’s confidence to provide care, we will be able to design tailored and targeted interventions to reduce risk of COVID- 19 contagion, and improve quality of life for dementia spousal caregivers.",Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision,10201213,R01AG062690,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Crowding ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' foot ', ' Foundations ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' spousal care giver ', ' spousal caregiver ', ' spouse care giver ', ' Spouse Caregiver ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' respiratory ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' contagion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' parent grant ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' recruit ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' ']",NIA,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,493162,TX-02,-0.02677924568733005
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes.

"A Novel Mechanism for Helping Older Adults Discontinue Use of Sleeping Pills The use of hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists (z-drugs), is associated with impaired cognition in older adults. Some studies suggest that benzodiazepine discontinuation is associated with improvement in cognitive domains such as memory, psychomotor speed, attention, and concentration and reduced risk of incident Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia. Sustained hypnotic discontinuation rates, however, are suboptimal, even when patients receive the gold standard treatment for insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), combined with a supervised gradual tapering of the hypnotic. In our current “Sleep Without Insomnia or The use of Chronic Hypnotics (SWITCH)” trial (R01AG057929), we are testing the efficacy of a new program, Masked Taper plus cognitive behavioral therapy-augmented program (MTcap), for improving hypnotic discontinuation success rates. We are currently collecting cognitive outcomes using in-person, structured cognitive tests so that we can conduct pre-planned analyses that will examine the impact of MTcap on cognition. The long-term goal of the supplemental research is to understand the relationships between benzodiazepine/z-drug use, drug discontinuation, and insomnia and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia incidence. This supplement project’s objectives are to establish the feasibility of using patient-centric cognitive testing approaches that leverage the growing use of mobile technology among middle-aged and older adults and to explore novel measures of cognition collected through mobile technology (i.e., digital markers of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia). The central hypothesis is that benzodiazepines/z-drug use and insomnia impair cognition and that discontinuation of these hypnotics and treatment of insomnia may reduce Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia incidence. The central hypothesis will be tested in a future study, with preparatory work completed in the proposed supplemental project focusing on cognitive testing through mobile technology. This preliminary data, using an innovative approach, will improve our understanding of the relationships between hypnotic use, insomnia, and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias and offer treatment options to reducing dementia incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it tests the feasibility of mobile cognitive testing in the context of chronic hypnotic use and chronic insomnia, which are both prevalent in adults, and provides preliminary data for future studies that will examine the relationships between hypnotic use, insomnia, and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.

"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit.

"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions: Supplement to focus on Alzheimer's and/or other dementias PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The primary objective of the parent study is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. This supplement extends our design to monitor, assess, and intervene for individuals with ADRDs and their caregivers. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smartwatches, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to train algorithms for health assessment (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to extend brain health and objectively capture intervention both adherence and caregiver support (Aim 3). Clinician guidance is used to train machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize health events (Aim 4). Given the unique challenges that will arise when we include individuals with ADRDs, we also introduce novel methods to track multiple residents in smart environments (Aim 5) and compare behaviors between individuals with ADRDs and the original sample of older adults with chronic health conditions (Aim 6). These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed supplement builds on a parent “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home study that automatically identifies health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. In this supplement, we will use clinician-guided smart home technology to recognize health events and the impact of a brain health intervention for adults with ADRDs. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions: Supplement to focus on Alzheimer's and/or other dementias,10086759,R01NR016732,"['behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' brain behavior ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' intervention effect ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Care giver support ', ' Caregiver support ', ' brain health ', ' study population ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' care costs ', ' health assessment ', ' age in place ', ' aging in place ', ' smart home ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' learning algorithm ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' algorithm training ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' behavior change ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' technology implementation ', ' technology validation ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,366710,WA-05,0.07898443985322805
"Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging” annual meetings to be offered each September from 2020 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting builds on its very successful first instance in 2019 and will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data. This is ultimately expected to lead to a better molecular understanding of the aging process and to novel approaches for the improvement of human healthspan and/or lifespan.",Systems Immunology in

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Drug Treatments and the Impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s Patients and Other Vulnerable Populations Interventions in health policy and care management have the potential to reduce COVID-19 infections and deaths, particularly if they can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations such as patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In this supplement proposal, we compile information and develop tools that can accelerate and target such interventions. The first aim is to identify the medical and socioeconomic characteristics of people that make them most vulnerable to COVID-19. We create cohorts of patients with ADRD and for other vulnerable populations based on their Fall 2019 characteristics, and follow them through 2020 to identify those at greatest risk of both “direct” COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., critical illness, mortality) and “indirect” increases in non-COVID outcomes. The second aim is an ambitious proof of concept: using natural experiments to shed light on novel drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19 with a particular focus on drugs most heavily used by ADRD patients (e.g., anticholinesterase inhibitors). We will develop and apply a machine learning approach to test the potential effect of drug classes on COVID-19, measured by diagnosis, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. This supplement is made possible by a unique opportunity: Access to near-real-time Medicare claims data (one-month lag), which CMS appears willing to make available through an expedited data use agreement.

"Development of a reminiscence therapy online platform with machine learning to increase engagement with people living with dementia and their care partners PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias, and the number of affected individuals is rapidly growing. Symptoms include impaired cognition, resulting in difficulty in performing daily activities and consequent functional dependence on others. The progressive nature of AD and ADRD can result in increasing degrees of care required from professional and family caregivers. Non- pharmacologic interventions positively influence cognition, mood, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and one well-established intervention, life story work (the use of written and oral life histories), serves as an effective technique that can elicit conversation and memories in those with AD and ADRD. However, generating useful life story materials is a time-consuming task for caregivers. To overcome this barrier, LifeBio Inc. is developing a reminiscence therapy platform —LifeBio MemoryTM— with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers. The LifeBio MemoryTM platform application will elicit and store individuals’ stories, photos, and videos and ultimately deliver personalized, point-of-care reminiscence therapy exercises for patients. In preliminary work supporting this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Inc. partnered with the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging to conduct a pilot study in nursing homes, which showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms among participants in LifeBio Inc.’s intervention and revealed that the majority of participants considered knowledge of their life story to be important for caregivers, while caregivers also reported positive experiences in relation to the impact of the intervention on caregiving. In this project we will: 1) Develop prototype enhancements of the existing LifeBio program and conduct focus group evaluations of these prototypes with 12 existing or former LifeBio users, 20 dementia care professionals familiar with LifeBio and 6 older adults with early-stage dementia to help maintain person-centered practices throughout the research process; 2) Finalize the LifeBio Memory product, which will include the development of a system to automatically record and process individuals’ life stories. 3) Conduct a full-scale fidelity trial of the complete package with 40 care professionals and 160 dementia care dyads across within an assisted living setting. The product of this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Memory™, will be a novel, scalable, and easily implemented solution through which caregivers and healthcare providers can offer person-centered care to people living with AD and AD-related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Non-pharmacological interventions and person-centered care strategies are important elements of care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Life story work, which uses written and oral life histories to elicit conversation and memories, is an effective intervention for individuals with dementia; however, because of the time-consuming nature of generating useful life story materials, has not been widely implemented in nursing homes and other care environments.

"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups. Project Narrative The proposed research study aims to refine an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk.

"Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? According to the latest population estimates by the US Census bureau, the United States population is growing older and more diverse, with their projections indicating that in 2035 there will be more people 65-and-older than 18-and-younger. In terms of diversity, the US Census Bureau projects that by 2060 the non-Hispanic White-alone population will shrink by 20 million, leading to the increased representation of currently underrepresented minority groups. These future population milestones paired with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in medicine, present a very unique and problematic problem: determining if AI solutions are fair for underrepresented populations within older adults. This has been a very debated issue, with opinion pieces in the New York times making it clear that when done incorrectly, AI solutions can actually worsen health disparities in underrepresented populations due to the nature of the training sets for said AI solutions. It is intuitive to understand how dermatology AI systems could be biased to perform better for lighter skinned individuals, due to the prevalence of said patients in the training datasets. Other biases come from the fact that there is simply a lack of diverse research subjects, which is why their mortality outcomes are considerably worse. Electronic phenotyping algorithms are the cornerstone for automatic identification of selected patient groups for tasks like disease classification, epidemiological studies and clinical-trial recruitment. These algorithms are both rule-based or probabilistic in nature (machine learning models), and are usually built by using bundled patient populations (everybody put together), with very few exceptions (due to the nature of the phenotype) having some sort of stratification of populations. This proposed project seeks to identify bias in probabilistic electronic phenotype algorithms for older populations and create best-practices and software tools to overcome them in order to lead to better health outcomes. Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? We will determine racial and age bias in probabilistic phenotype algorithms in both local, and national datasets. After characterizing bias, we will develop best-practices and software tools to improve the phenotyping process to achieve fairness for underrepresented minorities.",Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision,10049865,P30AG059307,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Censuses ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dermatology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Research Subjects ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' patient population ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' race bias ', ' racial bias ', ' ethnic bias ', ' population stratification ', ' recruit ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,50916,CA-18,0.06910223737334756
"Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer's (SARA) Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this Phase I Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a socially integrative and supportive robot system to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). One in 10 people 65 and older has AD, with estimates of up to as many as 5.5 million Americans currently living with AD. Because of the loss of cognitive function and subsequent changes in employment and reduced engagement with social groups and hobbies, AD/ADRD patients often experience loneliness and social isolation, and the considerable challenge of caring for these individuals often causes similar effects in caregivers. If successful, SARA will have significant impact on AD/ADRD patient care and quality of life, reducing loneliness and social isolation.  The specific aims of this two-year pilot study are to: (1) adapt commercial robot and peripheral hardware to create accessible interactions for AD/ADRD patients; (2) design and develop the robot interaction software to provide rich, supportive interaction; and (3) assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of SARA with AD/ADRD older adults and their caregivers. SARA employs user-community-driven design processes and evaluations to address key challenges surrounding how to best apply commercial robots and engaging interaction methodologies to improve AD/ADRD patient care. We will develop SARA through an iterative development process that produces and evaluates three versions of the system during the Phase I effort.  SARA is significant in three ways. SARA reduces loneliness by providing robotic social interactions. SARA reduces social isolation by connecting the patient more closely with family, friends, and caregivers, both directly and through social media. SARA provides social assistance in three ways: (1) through automated reminders and question answering for everyday information that is easily and often forgotten by patients; (2) conveyance of health regimens (e.g., What can I have for lunch? Should I still exercise today?); and (3) monitoring for caregivers.  SARA contains three central innovations. First, to create a user experience that is well tuned to the needs of patients and caregivers, SARA is created with significant feedback from AD/ADRD patients and caregivers. Second, to enable us to build on multiple robotic platforms that can meet this user experience, and to provide future extensibility, SARA features a platform-agnostic software and hardware framework that can integrate with a wide range of consumer social robots. Third, to create engaging, believable, and effective interactions with AD/ADRD patients, SARA uses and extends an AI-based architecture, Hap, which is specifically designed to create socially engaging interactive characters and robots that provide enjoyable and stimulating interactions. Project Narrative  As many as 5.5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, eventually impairing the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks.

"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study.

"SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations   According to the latest US Census Bureau predictions, by 2035 older people are projected to outnumber children for the first time in US history. This brings significant societal challenges based on their unique living and health-related conditions stemming from reduced sensory, motor, and cognitive capabilities, as wen as multiple chronic conditions. We propose a personalized and context-aware voice-based digital assistant to improve the quality of life and the healthcare of older adults. VOLI will leverage the growing capabilities of existing technologies, such as mobile devices and smart speakers, and go well beyond the basics of weather reports, news services, and simple games, to provide more complex voice-based services and to focus on the healthcare domain with its many challenges and constraints. We will pursue three parallel research aims: 1) Our technical aim will investigate how digital assistants, natural language processing, and machine learning can produce meaningful health-related conversations by leveraging population- and patient-level data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs); 2) Our social, behavioral, and cognitive aim will focus on designing services for older adults based on their needs to support independence and investigate the acceptability of digital assistants for the aging population; and 3) Our clinical aim will investigate how digital assistants can detect new symptoms and correlate them with medication side effects and interactions, worsening of existing conditions, or onset of new illnesses. Using our VOLI voice-assistant, older adults will be able to get medication reminders and instructions based on prescriptions and clinical notes from EHRs, notify their family/caregiver about their well-being status, interact with their healthcare provider, request an Uber/Lyft car or other third-party services, engage in cognitive games, report symptoms as they occur throughout the day and over the counter medications they are taking, ask questions about symptoms and medications, and so on. VOLi integrates information from EHRs, clinical ontologies, and patient-level terminology. This work will be supported by innovations in natural language understanding, deep learning, and human-computer interfaces. Our work is guided by both clinicians and researchers in human-centered computing. Our team has a history of successful interdisciplinary work in healthcare, expert systems in clinical care, EHR integration, patient monitoring and self-report, ubiquitous computing, data analytics, and field studies. This research directly supports the mission of NIA by addressing the needs of older adults to be independent in their homes and to optimize their healthcare based on the context of their symptoms and medications. VOLI will also reduce caregiving burden and optimize the interactions with healthcare and service providers. The research can be extended to monitor recovery after surgery and reduce length of stay in the hospital, identify onset of new illness, or Identify when to refer a patient to hospice.",SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations  ,10019457,R56AG067393,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Awareness ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitals ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Voice ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' news ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Sensory ', ' Services ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' Monitor ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' caregiving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' care giving burden ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' user centered computing ', ' human centered computing ', ' stem ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' clinical care ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Data Analytics ', ' ubiquitous computing ', ' service providers ', ' digital assistant ', ' intelligent assistant ', ' personal digital assistant ', ' virtual assistant ', ' intelligent personal assistant ', ' deep learning ', ' post-operative recovery ', ' recovery after surgery ', ' recovery following surgery ', ' postoperative recovery ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2020,299370,CA-52,0.013834821977556819
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging

"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. In this study, we will use analytical methods to identify high-risk subgroups, test personalized nudges to address barriers among these groups, and then implement a pragmatic, multisite trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates among older adults and reduce disparities in care.",BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,10050234,R61AG068945,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Herpes zoster disease ', ' Herpes Zoster ', ' Shingles ', ' Zona ', ' Zoster ', ' herpes zona ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' flu infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pneumococcal Infections ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae Infections ', ' pneumococcal disease ', ' pneumococcus infection ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' Preventative health service ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' flu immunisation ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' vaccination against influenza ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vendor ', ' Veterans ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' peer ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' multisite trial ', ' multi-site trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescription opioid ', ' operation ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,315340,PA-03,0.09988622417360532
"San Diego Nathan Shock Center PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies. The SD-NSC will establish cutting-edge Research Resource Cores focused on: 1) novel human cell and organoid models of aging, including from a unique human aging cohort that is annotated for physical and functional measures of biological age, 2) single-cell and high resolution -omics and imaging techniques, and 3) computational modelling of aging networks. The SD-NSC Research Resource Cores will provide scientific services to the NSC Network and the aging research community, and disseminate samples, datasets protocols, and computational tools. These resources will be complemented by a Research Development Core and Center outreach activities that will provide: 1) pilot grants and customized mentoring programs to encourage and support early-stage and established investigators new to aging research, 2) innovative in- person and virtual training in advanced methods and technologies to address cellular heterogeneity, and 3) intellectual leadership through novel programming to encourage collaboration and the dissemination of knowledge related to the basic biology of aging. The SD-NSC will bring together complementary expertise and resources from three renowned San Diego research Institutions with the common goal of understanding the role of cellular heterogeneity in aging to ultimately enable interventions to extend human healthspan. PROJECT NARRATIVE The cells and tissues of the human body age at different rates depending on their precise anatomical location and environment.

"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of

"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy.

"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC.

"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women. This program grant will provide new and improved evidence to help the public understand how to interrupt sitting in ways that support healthy aging.  ","Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality",9949575,P01AG052352,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endothelium ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Laboratories ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methodology ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Posture ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' sedentary ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' post-menopausal ', ' postmenopausal ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Blood flow ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Physical Function ', ' behavioral observation ', ' behavior observation ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Biostatistics Core ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Interruption ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' healthy aging ', ' evidence base ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' attentional control ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' response markers ', ' response biomarker ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' exercise intervention ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P01,2020,1750278,CA-52,0.12102617539533318
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity.

"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly

"Epigenetic Age Measures to Predict COVID-19 Symptom Progression and Severity PROJECT SUMMARY  The risk of fatality and/or severe complications due to COVID-19 infection is strongly age dependent. Data from the CDC suggests that those ages 85 and older have predicted mortality rates that is 100-fold higher than for those under the age of 50 and currently, 8 out of 10 COVID-19 deaths in the United States were in adults age 65 or older. While the exact etiology underlying this age disparity is unknown, evidence suggests that vulnerability may be due to changes that occur as a function of the aging process. This is further evidenced by the pattern of increased vulnerability among persons with pre-existing diseases of aging—cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, chronic kidney disease, liver disease—suggesting that it isn't just chronological age that determines risk, but rather, biological age.  In recent years, our group has helped develop some of the most robust biomarkers available, namely the epigenetic clocks. These measures estimate biological age in a sample based on DNA methylation levels at hundreds to thousands of CpG sites across the genome. Not only do epigenetic clocks track with age in diverse tissues and cell types, but discrepancies between epigenetic age and actual age have also been shown to predict risk of mortality and incidence of major chronic disease, including those which appear to be major risk factors for COVID-19. However, in order for these measures to be informative for assessing COVID-19 risk clinically, or in the general population, 1) they need to be re-optimized to capture the aspects of biological aging specific to COVID-19 susceptibility, and 2) advances in technology need to be made to ensure lower costs and rapid turnaround.  This proposal aims to build on our team's multidisciplinary strengths to develop and validate a targeted, lab-developed, readily-available test to predict COVID-19 symptomology and mortality risk. If successful, this test will have widespread applications—from informing triage and treatment decisions in the clinic, to guiding social and pollical decisions when it comes to lifting “stay-at-home” orders for certain individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE The risks associated with COVID-19 infection are highly age and health dependent, suggesting that biological aging may be a major determinant for symptom severity and mortality risk. Based on our previous work in developing biomarkers of aging, we propose to develop and validate a novel, rapid, and affordable COVID-19 test to predict long-term response to infection, based on DNA methylation.",Epigenetic Age Measures to Predict COVID-19 Symptom Progression and Severity,10158592,R00AG052604,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Genome ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Immunocompetence ', ' Immunologic Competence ', ' Immunological Competence ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' Measures ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Ventilator ', ' base ', ' 85+ years old ', ' age 85 and greater ', ' age 85 and older ', ' aged 85 and greater ', ' aged 85 and older ', ' human very old age (85+) ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Lifting ', ' Ensure ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' resilience ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' Geroscience ', ' clinical risk ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' Risk stratification ', ' preservation ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,139448,CT-03,0.016791694183316937
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10092237,R01AG069765,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Incidence ', ' Indiana ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Quick Test ', ' Quick Test for Liver Function ', ' Caring ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' base ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Dementia rating scale ', ' Clinical dementia rating scale ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost effective ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' patient screening ', ' societal costs ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' comparative effectiveness trial ', "" Alzheimer's therapeutic "", "" Alzheimer's disease therapeutic "", ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,1094329,IN-07,-0.003044728413368828
"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10092007,R01AG065218,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' iterative design ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Analytics ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' health assessment ', ' smart home ', ' functional independence ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,600384,WA-05,0.05383185811249995
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9955317,R01MH111265,"['absorption ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Consultations ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Gliosis ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Head ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heating ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' magnetic field ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' neuropathology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' vascular depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' late life depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' aged brain ', ' aging brain ', ' treatment strategy ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' disturbance in affect ', ' mood alteration ', ' mood and affect disturbance ', ' mood disturbance ', ' mood dysfunction ', ' affective disturbance ', ' radiofrequency ', ' radio frequency ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' imaging based approach ', ' imaging approach ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,611884,PA-18,0.10986810244554147
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9981740,R01ES027747,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Biometals ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Sulfate ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' cohort ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,757233,MA-07,-0.01996203258613288
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,9970378,R01AG057764,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arousal ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Censuses ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Fraud ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Deception ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Competence ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' American ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' financial decision making ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' phishing ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' brain behavior ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' cybersecurity ', ' internet security ', ' cyber security ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social factors ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,322426,FL-03,0.14692889533167078
"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients. The main goal of this proposal is to use Michigan Medicine’s electronic health records to develop a tool to identify high-risk ADRD patients.",Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia,10039692,K01AG068361,"['Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Workers ', ' Stress ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Logistics ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Medical History ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' frailty ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Familiarity ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' skills ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' electronic structure ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' health data ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Data Science ', ' predictive tools ', ' re-admission risk ', ' readmission risk ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' unstructured data ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Influentials ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,130140,MI-12,0.017774595988672117
"Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community. OVERALL—PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human aging is influenced by genetic factors, whereby differences in longevity as well as changes in health and disease risk with time are linked to variation in individuals' genetic codes. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center will develop resources to encourage the use of a wider range of mouse models in aging research. Resources—including aged mouse models that mirror human genetic variation, metabolic and microbiome data, and methods to reveal genetic factors tied to human aging—will be available to the scientific community, accelerating research to understand and ultimately prolong healthy human aging.",Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10045024,P30AG038070,"['Aging ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Animals ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' animal tissue ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Polygenic Characters ', ' Polygenic Inheritances ', ' Polygenic Traits ', ' Institution ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Inbred Strain ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Validation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' senescent ', ' senescence ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' phenome ', ' candidate validation ', ' Geroscience ', ' phenotypic data ', ' health-span ', ' healthspan ', ' data tools ', ' data dissemination ', ' mouse genetics ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' ']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,P30,2020,1069526,ME-02,0.06214984061692241
"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,10020322,R44AG058354,"['Accidents ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Beds ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Family ', ' Floor ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Memory ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Occupational Therapist ', ' Population Control ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Robotics ', ' Safety ', ' San Francisco ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' falls ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Letters ', ' Life ', ' Notification ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' phase I protocol ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' standard of care ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' dementia care ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' care costs ', ' deep learning ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' memory care ', ' ']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2020,493633,CA-13,0.03723770730015016
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10009334,R21EB027852,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Exercise ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motion ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Science ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' preventing falls ', ' Fall prevention ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Measurement ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' novel ', ' Study Subject ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' fall risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' medical attention ', ' standard measure ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' efficacy testing ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' cognitive burden ', ' cognitive load ', ' treadmill ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2020,229404,VT-00,0.03380343318365348
"Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the leading cause of dependence and disability in the elderly population worldwide, costing the US healthcare system over $200 billion annually. Because ADRD represents a continuous irreversible physical and cognitive decline, identifying effective approaches for its prevention is imperative. Hypertension, particularly in midlife, is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Recent data from the randomized Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Memory and cognition IN Decreased hypertension (SPRINT MIND) demonstrated that intensive SBP control (<120 mmHg) reduced the combined incidence of adjudicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia, as well as abnormal white matter lesion (WML) volume compared to standard BP control (<140 mmHg) over five years follow up. To maximize public health impact, it is critical to identify which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and if cognitive benefits were due to direct effects of specific antihypertensive medications on cognition independent of, or in addition to, their BP-lowering effect. Prior animal and human studies, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have greater effects on cognition than angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). If verified, this finding would be significant since ARBs and ACEIs are currently among the medications most commonly prescribed to older adults and are thought to be equivalent in benefit and safety. Our objective is to answer remaining questions of how to safely implement SPRINT in older patients most likely to derive cognitive benefits from intensive SBP treatment. With its large sample size, 5 years follow-up, and high-quality repeated measures of rigorously adjudicated cognitive outcomes, brain imaging, and antihypertensive medication use, SPRINT MIND provides a unique, cost-efficient, and ideal setting to answer these questions. We aim to: (1) develop and validate a prediction tool that quantifies patients’ expected cognitive benefits and net (overall) benefit incorporating cognitive and cardiovascular benefit and risk of SAEs under intensive SBP treatment, and (2) determine comparative effects, including dose-response, of ARB- vs. ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens on cognitive and brain structure outcomes independent of SBP-lowering effects. Though SPRINT MIND is among the first randomized trials to demonstrate a beneficial preventive effect on cognition, it is uncertain how SPRINT-MIND should be implemented and in which patients. Successful completion of this project will guide next steps for implementation by determining: (1) which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and (2) if ARBs have greater beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes and WML volume than ACEIs, independent of their similar SBP lowering effects.

"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,9973645,R01EY030517,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Choroid ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cytoplasmic Granules ', ' granule ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipofuscin ', ' Maps ', ' Melanins ', ' Methods ', ' Ophthalmoscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Perfusion ', ' Phenotype ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Structure of retinal pigment epithelium ', ' Outer pigmented layer of retina ', ' Pigment cell layer of retina ', ' Pigmented layer of retina ', ' Retinal Pigment Epithelium ', ' Retinal pigment epithelial cells ', ' Risk ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' Bruch Membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruchs membrane ', ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Rod Photoreceptors ', ' rod cell ', ' retinal rods ', ' Cone Photoreceptors ', ' cone cell ', ' Retinal Cone ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Primate Diseases ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Retinal Photoreceptors ', ' Rods and Cones ', ' Vertebrate Photoreceptors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' fluorophore ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Druse ', ' Drusen ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Therapy Evaluation ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' early onset ', ' restorative treatment ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' neuro-vascular unit ', ' neurovascular unit ', ' macular ', ' macula ', ' Prevalence ', ' normal aging ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' adaptive optics ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' imaging platform ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' clinical imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,527040,PA-18,0.030595664659117172
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain.
