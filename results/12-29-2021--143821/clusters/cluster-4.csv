"Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate breast cancer screening demands that radiologists maintain a balance of high sensitivity and high specificity when interpreting mammography. Subspecialty-trained breast imagers perform significantly better than general radiologists by recognizing more breast cancers and minimizing benign biopsies. An automated reasoning system called a Bayesian network (BN), has the potential to improve the performance of general radiologists, who interpret the majority of mammograms, to the level of subspecialty-trained breast radiologists, who are in short supply. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model that has been used for decision support in a variety of domains, including radiology. Machine learning provides an appealing way to create and optimize BNs to perform at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Our research group has developed a prototype, expert-defined BN that uses imaging features and demographic risk factors to classify abnormalities on mammograms as benign or malignant. Our BN can perform at a higher level than general radiologists, but our goal is for it to perform as well or better than subspecialty-trained breast radiologists. To this end, we have compiled a structured, multi-relational dataset of mammography abnormalities and pathologic outcomes from which cutting edge machine learning techniques can construct an improved BN. In the past, BNs were trained and tested on individual abnormalities in isolation. In fact, other abnormalities on the same mammogram or previous mammograms, which necessarily appear in other rows of a relational database, can further improve BN learning. We have used basic statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to enhance Bayesian learning algorithms to leverage this important additional data. A novel SRL capability introduced by our team within the last year, called view learning, makes it possible to incorporate this related data from other parts of the database by automatically defining new database fields. In our preliminary work, we have shown a stepwise improvement in BN performance: first, with conventional BN learning; then, with basic SRL; and finally, with view learning. We now seek support to determine whether more tightly integrated SRL and view learning will significantly improve our BN's ability to accurately diagnose breast cancer. In addition, we propose to investigate whether two other promising machine learning techniques, predicate-invention and collective-classification, can optimize the BN to perform at levels significantly better than current clinical practice.           ",Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening,7776970,R01CA127379,"['Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Text ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Foundations ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' image processing ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' acronyms ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' radiologist ', ' RDST ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Biopsy ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' computer science ', ' Boxing ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Gur ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Glossary ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Multiple Abnormalities ', ' Modeling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Outcome ', ' prototype ', ' clinical practice ', ' relational database ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2010,277409,WI-02,0.2088002253633323
"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can detect cancer and monitor treatment response.

"A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests K07 support for Dr. Elizabeth Burnside to become an independent investigator and leader in the use of computer models to improve the early detection of breast cancer. This award will allow Dr. Burnside to optimize and validate a computer model called a Bayesian network designed to provide decision-support for radiologists interpreting mammography. This project is a multidisciplinary effort integrating computer science, applied medical informatics, population health science and breast imaging. The University of Wisconsin is an ideal environment for this work because it provides access to renowned researchers in these areas and individuals experienced with the inclusion of diverse populations in women's health research. To achieve these research and career goals, the candidate will follow a career development plan that consists of 1) acquisition of advanced research competencies in artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, probability theory, Bayesian reasoning, research ethics, and clinical trial design; 2) mentorship from nationally and internationally recognized experts; and 3) innovative research in computer-aided decision support in breast cancer diagnosis. The current state of breast cancer screening reveals a wide variability of practice and a shortage of expert mammographers. Dr. Burnside's model envisions using expert knowledge to improve non- expert performance in mammography. The model complements current computer-assisted detection algorithms by contributing information to crucial post-discovery aspects of mammography: interpretation and decision-making. Using probability theory, the model defines relationships between a patient's demographic risk factors, her mammographic findings, and diseases of the breast to generate a breast cancer risk assessment uniquely tailored to her. If successful, the model will improve the accuracy of decision-making, decrease the human costs of underperformance and variability, and deliver personalized medicine to patients who undergo mammography.

"Network-based Prediction of Antiestrogen Resistance in Breast Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2008, over 41,000 American women will die of breast cancer. In the same period, there will be almost 173,000 newly diagnosed cases of invasive breast cancer, approximately 70% of which will be estrogen receptor-1 positive (ER+). However, it is evident that we still do not fully understand either the nature of ER-driven molecular signaling or how this differs in endocrine sensitive and resistant breast tumors. In this project, we hypothesize that new insights into ER1-signaling can be discovered in the context of hormone responsiveness. We will develop, optimize, and apply innovative new computational methods to breast cancer gene expression microarray data sets. We will discover new knowledge of ER signaling and construct, test, and validate computational models of antiestrogen (AE) resistance. We also hypothesize that model predictions will have clinical/functional relevance and will identify new targets for drug development. Specific aims of this application include: (1) to develop new computational methods, integrative network analyses (INA), and use these to build and test computational models of ER1 signaling in the context of hormone responsiveness; (2) to develop a network motif-based prediction (NMP) scheme to integrate network information and gene expression profiles to identify signaling components of ER-mediated signaling associated with AE resistance; (3) to assess and validate the functional relevance of key genes in mechanistic studies in breast cancer models, and ultimately use this information to identify new therapeutic targets for drug discovery. The development of new therapies for endocrine resistant disease should have a major impact on breast cancer mortality and improve quality of life for breast cancer survivors. The proposed project will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, molecular biologists, and medical oncologists at Virginia Tech and Georgetown University Medical Center, and represents a continuation of the long and productive collaboration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While antiestrogen (AE) therapies induce a high proportion of objective responses and will have a significant survival benefit for some women, many of these cancers will recur due to AE resistance.

"Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although risk for developing breast cancer at an earlier age is low in a substantial fraction of person-years lost it is attributed to women under the age of 40 who die from this disease. Unfortunately, screening mammography, the ""gold standard"" and accepted practice over the age of 40 for breast cancer detection, performs poorly in younger women and combined with radiation risk and expected low yield resulted in the recommendation that annual screening in the general population is not recommended below this age. Alternative imaging modalities exist (e.g. MRI, US), however, these techniques are not being used for this purpose for a variety of reasons. It would greatly facilitate breast cancer detection in younger women if an inexpensive, easy to use, widely available technology was available to pre-screen women and determine who would most likely benefit from more comprehensive imaging based studies. Currently, the only generally used screening tool in young women is Clinical Breast Exam (CBE). However, CBE has low sensitivity, high false- positive rate and is examiner dependent. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising technology for fulfilling a pre-screening risk identification role as it relies on relatively inexpensive equipment that could be widely disseminated to practitioners' offices and it has demonstrated some effectiveness in detecting breast cancer regardless of age or breast density. Unfortunately, EIS technologies have demonstrated a relatively low sensitivity (~ 25 - 35%) when a high specificity (>90%) is required. Recently a new approach to EIS measurements has been developed and used quite successfully in non-medical applications. This new approach measures shifts in impedance near the resonant frequency when tissue is made a part of an RLC electric circuit. We refer to this new approach as Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS). The sensitivity of EIS near the resonant frequency is extremely high and we believe that using this approach (REIS) a much greater diagnostic performance can be achieved than was previously obtainable with EIS. In the R21 phase of this study we will build a prototype REIS device for rapidly evaluating (less than 10 minues) the breast and demonstrate feasibility for pre-screening women with the REIS device to determine who would benefit from a diagnostic imaging workup. This is not a breast cancer detection device but rather a risk stratification approach. Namely, the ultimate objective is to develop and test an approach that would segment the younger women population (< 40 years old) into two groups. One (REIS negative) that is expected to have normal risk of having breast cancer and the other (REIS positive) which identifies a group of women in which the risk of having breast cancer is substantially higher than in older women (40 - 49 years old) who are currently routinely screened. In the R33 phase a much larger patient population will be recruited and will be used to optimize the classification algorithm. Comparisons will be made with existing EIS technology. In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast. This would be achieved using a low cost, safe technology that could be used during routine office visits of young women who are not screened with mammography. If successful, this proposal will have a large public health impact via increased early detection of breast cancer.          ",Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy,7804524,R33CA127169,"['Skin ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Equipment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' breast density ', ' Foundations ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Premenopause ', ' pre-menopausal ', ' Premenopausal Period ', ' Premenopausal ', ' Pre-menopausal Period ', ' Pre-Menopause ', ' Incidence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Persons ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Noise ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Exposure to ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Western World ', ' Specificity ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Palpable ', ' palpable disease ', ' Biopsy ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Measures ', ' Radiation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' older women ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R33,2010,410341,PA-18,0.3074074239626537
"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1.

"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can detect cancer and monitor treatment response.

"Decision Support System for Predicting outcome of ER+ breast cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an alternative, inexpensive means for identifying the subset of women with ER+ breast cancer for whom hormonal therapy alone is sufficient, and adjuvant chemotherapy is not required. Our novel approach uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to extract information from digitized histological sections of breast tissue (e.g. graphical and morphological arrangement of nuclei, lymphocytes, textural appearance, and tubule density), yielding a continuous image-based risk score (IbRiS) from zero to one that predicts the risk of recurrence. By choosing the appropriate cutoff value, IbRiS can be used to stratify ER+ patients into two classes: low and high risk. A low risk identifies those women who would respond well to hormonal therapy alone.  Of the 120,000 women annually diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer in the US, the vast majority will be considered at high risk of having distant recurrence (metastasis) within 10 years. Under current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, these women will be advised to receive adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to standard hormonal treatment (e.g. tamoxifen). However, 85% of these women will not benefit from chemotherapy, and yet will still incur its deleterious side-effects.  The only non-investigational tool to help better determine which women should receive tamoxifen alone is the Oncotype Dx molecular assay, which is now widely used by medical oncologists. Oncotype Dx is able to correctly reclassify (as low-risk) 50% of those women with ER+ cancers that have been classified as high-risk (or intermediate-risk) by the NCCN guidelines, obviating their need for chemotherapy. However, Oncotype Dx is inaccessible to the majority of women in the US (and worldwide) because of its high cost ($4500), and requirement that the tissue samples be sent to specialized remote facilities. Consequently, there is clearly a market need for a lower-priced assay capable of reaching a wider audience.  The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: 1) develop an image-based risk score (IbRiS) for predicting the subset of women with ER+ breast cancer that wil respond wel without chemotherapy and 2) evaluate IbRiS performance in predicting recurrence over an independent set of ER+ breast cancers treated with tamoxifen alone. IbRiS has several key advantages over molecular assays. First, it requires no disruption of the current clinical protocol since the necessary tissue samples are already collected during routine pathological examinations. Second, IbRiS has a zero cost-of-goods sold, and thus could serve as either a lower-priced alternative to a molecular assay or as a quantitative triage, determining which patients should be administered the more expensive molecular test. Finally, since IbRiS only requires a digital slide scanner (i.e. no specialized facility is necessary), its footprint could extend worldwide (via the internet).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year tens of thousands of women in the US with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer are treated with chemotherapy, though only a few thousand will benefit from it. In this proposal we will develop an image-based risk score (IbRiS) to predict which women with ER+ breast cancer do not require chemotherapy. This test will provide an economical alternative to the far more expensive gene-expression based assays currently in use.           Every year tens of thousands of women in the US with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer are treated with chemotherapy, though only a few thousand will benefit from it.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Physician Expertise for Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to integrate physician expertise and machine learned, logical rules in a graphical model that will accurately estimate breast cancer risk after breast biopsy. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical and computer science literature) illustrating an innovative research program that merges cutting edge machine learning algorithms including inductive logic programming and statistical relational learning to train graphical models to predict breast cancer risk. However, in contrast to prior work, we are testing a completely new methodology which we call Advice-Based-Learning (ABLe). By developing ABLe, our team aims to establish an innovative, collaborative cycle between machine-learning and physician expertise. We propose to test the hypothesis that this cycle will increase accuracy beyond what either the machine or human can accomplish alone. Specifically, we hypothesize first that a conventionally-trained graphical model trained with conventional machine learning first algorithms can accurately predict the risk of breast cancer after core biopsy and perform better than current clinical practice; a critical aim that is favorably foreshadowed by our new preliminary data but is labor intensive because we must perfect our unique clinical data that accurately represents clinical experience. Second, a graphical model trained using ABLe can incorporate multi-relational data with physician expertise and significantly improve the predictive accuracy over conventionally trained graphical models and current clinical practice. Third, our best graphical model trained with ABLe will accurately estimate the probability of malignancy after breast biopsy on new clinical cases better than physicians alone resulting in a tool that has the potential to improve care.       Our clinical application is as compelling as our algorithmic work. Image-guided core needle biopsy of the breast is a common procedure that is imperfect, has high-stakes, and is particularly amenable to improvement with automated decision support. Breast core biopsy, the standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis, can be ""non-definitive"" in 5-15% of women undergoing this procedure. This means that between 35,000-105,000 women will require additional biopsies or radiologic follow-up to cement a diagnosis and risk the possibility of missed breast cancers, delays in diagnosis, and unnecessary surgeries. This important problem is emblematic of a plethora of clinical situations where rigorous and accurate risk estimation of rare events provides the opportunity for automated decisions support tools to personalize and strategically target health care interventions to improve decision-making for health-care providers and patients. This award will enable us not only to produce graphical models that provide improved decision support in the breast cancer clinic, but also, and more significantly, to develop a methodology that integrates heterogeneous predictive data and physician knowledge within a graphical model, thereby developing and validating a new algorithmic paradigm for creating accurate, comprehensible, adaptable decision support tools well-suited for clinical translation.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Our multidisciplinary group of breast cancer physicians and computer scientists propose to develop a new paradigm for construction of clinical decision support tools that will integrate machine learning (computers learning from data) and physician expertise in order to perform better than either alone.

"Bayesian Rule Learning Methods for Disease Prediction and Biomarker Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The problem: High-throughput biomedical data from biomarker profiling studies aimed at early detection of diseases like lung cancer are accumulating rapidly. Although many popular machine learning methods have been utilized for analysis of such high-dimensional datasets, no single method has consistently outperformed others. Moreover, scientists have the need to simultaneously address two related tasks: disease prediction and biomarker discovery, using the same sets of data and tools. One way, as undertaken in this project, to address this need is to find the most accurate classifier for the disease from a given set of profiles and present the discriminative markers used in that model to the scientist for further verification. The large space of possible models coupled with the small sample size of the data make it hard to accurately estimate predictive accuracy.       The solution: This project will develop, evaluate and refine novel Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) methods that are algorithmically efficient, result in parsimonious models and accurately estimate predictive uncertainty from sparse biomedical datasets. BRL methods utilize a Bayesian score to evaluate rule models, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in the validity of the rule itself. This novel technique that combines the mathematical rigor of Bayesian network learning with rule-based modeling opens up a hitherto underexplored area of fundamental research in informatics involving such hybrid methodologies. Rules enable modular representation of knowledge and collaboration with scientists, as it is easier to present the model and extract markers both visually and computationally. Rule-based inference is also simpler and more tractable. The Bayesian approach enables prior knowledge to be incorporated and evaluated in a continual fashion with a human in the loop. The latter is very important for refinement of both tools and models.       The specific aims: This project will test the hypothesis that the BRL methods developed and extended herein produce more accurate and parsimonious models for disease state prediction than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This project evaluates BRL methods and models using existing proteomic datasets for three diverse diseases - rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the two most common cancers in the world, lung and breast cancers. Experimental verification will be performed using a new set of retrospectively collected breast cancer sera samples to evaluate model generalizability.       The significance: This project will produce: (1) a novel biomedical data mining tool for analyzing data from biomarker profiling studies of any disease, (2) methodological insights into the applicability of this tool and current machine learning methods for such tasks, and (3) new data for research on the early detection of breast cancer. It has potential to help develop new diagnostic tests for early detection of ALS, lung and breast cancers and lays a firm foundation for building modeling frameworks that can incorporate both prior knowledge and data to provide the technological capability for combining evidence from multiple, heterogeneous sources.           This project will develop highly-needed data mining methods for analyzing the spate of datasets  arising from high-throughput technologies for molecular biomarker profiling. It will generate  new experimental data for early detection of breast cancer, and has the potential to help create  new diagnostic screening tools for three diverse diseases: two of the most common cancers in  the world - lung and breast cancers, and rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3.

"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.                  Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population.

"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year.

"Bayesian Rule Learning Methods for Disease Prediction and Biomarker Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The problem: High-throughput biomedical data from biomarker profiling studies aimed at early detection of diseases like lung cancer are accumulating rapidly. Although many popular machine learning methods have been utilized for analysis of such high-dimensional datasets, no single method has consistently outperformed others. Moreover, scientists have the need to simultaneously address two related tasks: disease prediction and biomarker discovery, using the same sets of data and tools. One way, as undertaken in this project, to address this need is to find the most accurate classifier for the disease from a given set of profiles and present the discriminative markers used in that model to the scientist for further verification. The large space of possible models coupled with the small sample size of the data make it hard to accurately estimate predictive accuracy.       The solution: This project will develop, evaluate and refine novel Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) methods that are algorithmically efficient, result in parsimonious models and accurately estimate predictive uncertainty from sparse biomedical datasets. BRL methods utilize a Bayesian score to evaluate rule models, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in the validity of the rule itself. This novel technique that combines the mathematical rigor of Bayesian network learning with rule-based modeling opens up a hitherto underexplored area of fundamental research in informatics involving such hybrid methodologies. Rules enable modular representation of knowledge and collaboration with scientists, as it is easier to present the model and extract markers both visually and computationally. Rule-based inference is also simpler and more tractable. The Bayesian approach enables prior knowledge to be incorporated and evaluated in a continual fashion with a human in the loop. The latter is very important for refinement of both tools and models.       The specific aims: This project will test the hypothesis that the BRL methods developed and extended herein produce more accurate and parsimonious models for disease state prediction than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This project evaluates BRL methods and models using existing proteomic datasets for three diverse diseases - rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the two most common cancers in the world, lung and breast cancers. Experimental verification will be performed using a new set of retrospectively collected breast cancer sera samples to evaluate model generalizability.       The significance: This project will produce: (1) a novel biomedical data mining tool for analyzing data from biomarker profiling studies of any disease, (2) methodological insights into the applicability of this tool and current machine learning methods for such tasks, and (3) new data for research on the early detection of breast cancer. It has potential to help develop new diagnostic tests for early detection of ALS, lung and breast cancers and lays a firm foundation for building modeling frameworks that can incorporate both prior knowledge and data to provide the technological capability for combining evidence from multiple, heterogeneous sources.           This project will develop highly-needed data mining methods for analyzing the spate of datasets  arising from high-throughput technologies for molecular biomarker profiling. It will generate  new experimental data for early detection of breast cancer, and has the potential to help create  new diagnostic screening tools for three diverse diseases: two of the most common cancers in  the world - lung and breast cancers, and rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years).        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.                  This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Physician Expertise for Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to integrate physician expertise and machine learned, logical rules in a graphical model that will accurately estimate breast cancer risk after breast biopsy. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical and computer science literature) illustrating an innovative research program that merges cutting edge machine learning algorithms including inductive logic programming and statistical relational learning to train graphical models to predict breast cancer risk. However, in contrast to prior work, we are testing a completely new methodology which we call Advice-Based-Learning (ABLe). By developing ABLe, our team aims to establish an innovative, collaborative cycle between machine-learning and physician expertise. We propose to test the hypothesis that this cycle will increase accuracy beyond what either the machine or human can accomplish alone. Specifically, we hypothesize first that a conventionally-trained graphical model trained with conventional machine learning first algorithms can accurately predict the risk of breast cancer after core biopsy and perform better than current clinical practice; a critical aim that is favorably foreshadowed by our new preliminary data but is labor intensive because we must perfect our unique clinical data that accurately represents clinical experience. Second, a graphical model trained using ABLe can incorporate multi-relational data with physician expertise and significantly improve the predictive accuracy over conventionally trained graphical models and current clinical practice. Third, our best graphical model trained with ABLe will accurately estimate the probability of malignancy after breast biopsy on new clinical cases better than physicians alone resulting in a tool that has the potential to improve care.       Our clinical application is as compelling as our algorithmic work. Image-guided core needle biopsy of the breast is a common procedure that is imperfect, has high-stakes, and is particularly amenable to improvement with automated decision support.

"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.                ",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,8436915,R01CA166269,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Calibration ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Matched Case-Control Study ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Film ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' Metric ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Bayesian Rule Learning Methods for Disease Prediction and Biomarker Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The problem: High-throughput biomedical data from biomarker profiling studies aimed at early detection of diseases like lung cancer are accumulating rapidly. Although many popular machine learning methods have been utilized for analysis of such high-dimensional datasets, no single method has consistently outperformed others. Moreover, scientists have the need to simultaneously address two related tasks: disease prediction and biomarker discovery, using the same sets of data and tools. One way, as undertaken in this project, to address this need is to find the most accurate classifier for the disease from a given set of profiles and present the discriminative markers used in that model to the scientist for further verification. The large space of possible models coupled with the small sample size of the data make it hard to accurately estimate predictive accuracy.       The solution: This project will develop, evaluate and refine novel Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) methods that are algorithmically efficient, result in parsimonious models and accurately estimate predictive uncertainty from sparse biomedical datasets. BRL methods utilize a Bayesian score to evaluate rule models, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in the validity of the rule itself. This novel technique that combines the mathematical rigor of Bayesian network learning with rule-based modeling opens up a hitherto underexplored area of fundamental research in informatics involving such hybrid methodologies. Rules enable modular representation of knowledge and collaboration with scientists, as it is easier to present the model and extract markers both visually and computationally. Rule-based inference is also simpler and more tractable. The Bayesian approach enables prior knowledge to be incorporated and evaluated in a continual fashion with a human in the loop. The latter is very important for refinement of both tools and models.       The specific aims: This project will test the hypothesis that the BRL methods developed and extended herein produce more accurate and parsimonious models for disease state prediction than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This project evaluates BRL methods and models using existing proteomic datasets for three diverse diseases - rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the two most common cancers in the world, lung and breast cancers. Experimental verification will be performed using a new set of retrospectively collected breast cancer sera samples to evaluate model generalizability.       The significance: This project will produce: (1) a novel biomedical data mining tool for analyzing data from biomarker profiling studies of any disease, (2) methodological insights into the applicability of this tool and current machine learning methods for such tasks, and (3) new data for research on the early detection of breast cancer. It has potential to help develop new diagnostic tests for early detection of ALS, lung and breast cancers and lays a firm foundation for building modeling frameworks that can incorporate both prior knowledge and data to provide the technological capability for combining evidence from multiple, heterogeneous sources.           This project will develop highly-needed data mining methods for analyzing the spate of datasets  arising from high-throughput technologies for molecular biomarker profiling. It will generate  new experimental data for early detection of breast cancer, and has the potential to help create  new diagnostic screening tools for three diverse diseases: two of the most common cancers in  the world - lung and breast cancers, and rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Physician Expertise for Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to integrate physician expertise and machine learned, logical rules in a graphical model that will accurately estimate breast cancer risk after breast biopsy. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical and computer science literature) illustrating an innovative research program that merges cutting edge machine learning algorithms including inductive logic programming and statistical relational learning to train graphical models to predict breast cancer risk. However, in contrast to prior work, we are testing a completely new methodology which we call Advice-Based-Learning (ABLe). By developing ABLe, our team aims to establish an innovative, collaborative cycle between machine-learning and physician expertise. We propose to test the hypothesis that this cycle will increase accuracy beyond what either the machine or human can accomplish alone. Specifically, we hypothesize first that a conventionally-trained graphical model trained with conventional machine learning first algorithms can accurately predict the risk of breast cancer after core biopsy and perform better than current clinical practice; a critical aim that is favorably foreshadowed by our new preliminary data but is labor intensive because we must perfect our unique clinical data that accurately represents clinical experience. Second, a graphical model trained using ABLe can incorporate multi-relational data with physician expertise and significantly improve the predictive accuracy over conventionally trained graphical models and current clinical practice. Third, our best graphical model trained with ABLe will accurately estimate the probability of malignancy after breast biopsy on new clinical cases better than physicians alone resulting in a tool that has the potential to improve care.       Our clinical application is as compelling as our algorithmic work. Image-guided core needle biopsy of the breast is a common procedure that is imperfect, has high-stakes, and is particularly amenable to improvement with automated decision support. Breast core biopsy, the standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis, can be ""non-definitive"" in 5-15% of women undergoing this procedure.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of

"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.          Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.

"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years).          This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.

"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System  Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.  Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.  Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only to patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.  We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems.  Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,8695607,R01LM011663,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Antibodies ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' dreaming ', ' Dreams ', ' Electronics ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' neu Genes ', ' erbb2 [{C0242957}] ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' Human EGF Receptor 2 Gene ', ' HER2/neu ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2 ', ' HER/2 ', ' HER-2 Genes ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' ERBB2 ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Herceptin ', ' Roche brand of trastuzumab ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Genomics ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,582816,PA-18,0.2867616489837759
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.

"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.                ",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,8625722,R01CA166269,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Calibration ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Matched Case-Control Study ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Film ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' Metric ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.          Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.

"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years).          This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC.             PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of

"Integrating Machine Learning and Physician Expertise for Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to integrate physician expertise and machine learned, logical rules in a graphical model that will accurately estimate breast cancer risk after breast biopsy. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical and computer science literature) illustrating an innovative research program that merges cutting edge machine learning algorithms including inductive logic programming and statistical relational learning to train graphical models to predict breast cancer risk. However, in contrast to prior work, we are testing a completely new methodology which we call Advice-Based-Learning (ABLe). By developing ABLe, our team aims to establish an innovative, collaborative cycle between machine-learning and physician expertise. We propose to test the hypothesis that this cycle will increase accuracy beyond what either the machine or human can accomplish alone. Specifically, we hypothesize first that a conventionally-trained graphical model trained with conventional machine learning first algorithms can accurately predict the risk of breast cancer after core biopsy and perform better than current clinical practice; a critical aim that is favorably foreshadowed by our new preliminary data but is labor intensive because we must perfect our unique clinical data that accurately represents clinical experience. Second, a graphical model trained using ABLe can incorporate multi-relational data with physician expertise and significantly improve the predictive accuracy over conventionally trained graphical models and current clinical practice. Third, our best graphical model trained with ABLe will accurately estimate the probability of malignancy after breast biopsy on new clinical cases better than physicians alone resulting in a tool that has the potential to improve care.       Our clinical application is as compelling as our algorithmic work. Image-guided core needle biopsy of the breast is a common procedure that is imperfect, has high-stakes, and is particularly amenable to improvement with automated decision support. Breast core biopsy, the standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis, can be ""non-definitive"" in 5-15% of women undergoing this procedure. This means that between 35,000-105,000 women will require additional biopsies or radiologic follow-up to cement a diagnosis and risk the possibility of missed breast cancers, delays in diagnosis, and unnecessary surgeries. This important problem is emblematic of a plethora of clinical situations where rigorous and accurate risk estimation of rare events provides the opportunity for automated decisions support tools to personalize and strategically target health care interventions to improve decision-making for health-care providers and patients. This award will enable us not only to produce graphical models that provide improved decision support in the breast cancer clinic, but also, and more significantly, to develop a methodology that integrates heterogeneous predictive data and physician knowledge within a graphical model, thereby developing and validating a new algorithmic paradigm for creating accurate, comprehensible, adaptable decision support tools well-suited for clinical translation.          PROJECT NARRATIVE Our multidisciplinary group of breast cancer physicians and computer scientists propose to develop a new paradigm for construction of clinical decision support tools that will integrate machine learning (computers learning from data) and physician expertise in order to perform better than either alone.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).

"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.                ",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,8817150,R01CA166269,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Calibration ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Matched Case-Control Study ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Film ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties with cognitive skills such as memory, thinking and attention are very common after breast cancer chemotherapy. These cognitive difficulties have been associated with chemotherapy-related injury to several brain regions, particularly those regions that also tend to be affected by brain aging. There is concern that chemotherapy may accelerate brain aging and increase patients' risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certain previous studies support this concern while others do not and therefore the effect of breast cancer chemotherapy on risk for Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. The proposed research will compare brain anatomy of breast cancer survivors to that of women who later developed Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, we will determine a pattern of brain anatomy that indicates the probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. This pattern, or classifier, will be determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that were obtained for approximately 100 women with Alzheimer's disease compared to MRI scans from a group of approximately 100 healthy, unaffected women. We will then apply the classifier to MRI scans from 108 breast cancer survivors, 67 who received chemotherapy treatment and 41 who did not. Using the machine learning classifier, we will calculate a score for each breast cancer survivor that indicates her probability of developing Alzheimer's disease based on her brain anatomy. We believe that probability scores will be significantly higher in the chemotherapy group compared to the no-chemotherapy group. We will also explore possible predictors of probability score such as demographic, disease, genetic and treatment factors. This project has the potential to improve our ability to identify patients at risk for persistent and/or progressive chemotherapy-related brain injury using a simple, non-invasive five minute MRI scan. This information could potentially inform treatment decision-making and prioritize patients for early intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to improve our understanding regarding the brain changes that occur following breast cancer chemotherapy. This research is highly relevant to breast cancer, one of the most common public health problems, affecting 1 in 8 women.            ",Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease,8813205,R03CA191559,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' human APOE epsilon4 protein ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Diffuse Brain Injury ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Brain region ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' chemo brain ', ' chemobrain ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' neuropsychological ', ' chemotherapy ', ' aging brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2015,80000,TX-09,0.20352651767054794
"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q- BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinica trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. Key Words: quantitative breast parenchyma analysis, image-based biomarker, breast cancer risk prediction, full-field digital mammogram (FFDM)         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens. This will be a step towards the development of personalized medicine and reducing the overall health care costs.            ",Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk,8890485,U01CA195599,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cause of Death ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Counseling ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Distribution ', ' Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Epithelial ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Descriptor ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Contralateral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,412385,MI-12,0.3612283153982633
"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of

"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,8928084,U01CA184902,"['dimethylbenzanthracene ', ' DMBA ', ' Benz(a)anthracene, 7,12-dimethyl- ', ' 7,12-dimentylbenzanthracene ', '

"Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel image-based breast cancer risk factor based on functional behavior of breast fibroglandular tissue that can improve risk stratification of women with mammographically dense breasts. Over 40% of screening-eligible women have mammographically dense breasts, which refers to a high amount of fibroglandular tissue relative to fat on a mammogram. These women are at elevated risk of developing breast cancer, based on a large body of evidence showing density as one of the strongest risk factors, and are increasingly encouraged to discuss their density-related risk with providers. Yet, the discriminatory accuracy of breast density is weak, limiting its usefulness in clinical risk prediction. We postulate that mammographic density does have importance in risk assessment, with the critical caveat that not all dense tissue confers equivalent risk. Because mammography creates an anatomic depiction of the breast, it is inherently unable to distinguish the known functional heterogeneity of breast fibroglandular tissue among women that likely has important implications in regards to breast cancer risk. We propose that functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue or level of background parenchymal uptake (BPU) that can be assessed on molecular breast imaging (MBI) exams allows for a non-invasive means for determining the subset of women with dense tissue who are at greatest risk of developing breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will establish a retrospective cohort study of 3300 women who had screening MBI performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester between the years 2004 - 2015. MBI exams, mammograms, and medical history information will be obtained; assessments of BPU and mammographic density from existing imaging will be performed; and incident breast cancers in the cohort will be identified via the Mayo Clinic tumor registry and mailed follow-up. In Aim 2, we will use this well-characterized cohort to examine the association of BPU (assessed both categorically and quantitatively) and breast cancer risk. Cox proportional-hazards regression will be employed in a multivariable model with adjustments for covariates, including mammographic density. An exploratory analysis of the interaction between BPU and mammographic density will also be performed using a Gradient Boosting Machine learning algorithm. We hypothesize that high BPU will be associated with increased cancer risk relative to low BPU, beyond the association observed between density and risk. We will also explore whether BPU stratifies the risk associated with dense breasts. This work is the first evaluation of BPU on MBI as a breast cancer risk factor and the first investigation into whether functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue can discriminate risk of mammographically dense tissue. For increasing numbers of women who are now undergoing MBI for supplemental breast screening, this additional risk information will be valuable in guiding clinical decisions regarding tailored screening and risk-reduction options.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of women in the U.S. who are eligible for screening mammography, 43% or 27.5 million are estimated to have mammographically dense breasts - a factor strongly associated with increased breast cancer risk. Yet, mammographic density has limited discriminatory accuracy to be useful for risk assessment. We propose that assessment of the functional behavior of dense tissue, as imaged by a molecular breast imaging (MBI) exam, can identify the subset of women with dense breasts who are at the greatest risk of developing breast cancer, and therefore are most likely to benefit from increased surveillance or preventive risk-reduction options.            ",Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor,8956477,R21CA197752,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Epithelium ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Masks ', ' Radiology-Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Lobular ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Evaluation ', ' Relative Risks ', ' uptake ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Metabolic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' functional status ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Appearance ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Preventive ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' tumor registry ', ' Population ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,138330,MN-01,0.3679421823435475
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.                ",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,8967740,U24CA189523,"['Atlases ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Explosion ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Glioma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Infiltration ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Transcend ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Informatics ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Slice ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' molecular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' imaging probe ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' image registration ', ' Information Technology ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' treatment response ', ' phenomics ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' precision medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2015,653458,PA-03,0.17930882131007966
"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.            ",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma,8985889,R01CA199996,"['Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Glycoproteins ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' Microscopy ', ' Milk ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Needles ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Noise ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Stains ', ' Time ', ' Tissue/Specimen Collection ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Normal Values ', ' Normal Range ', ' Tissue Banking ', ' base ', ' density ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Aspirate ', ' Aspirate substance ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Image Guided Biopsy ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Width ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin ', ' H and E ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Mammary Carcinoma ', ' Breast Carcinoma ', ' Structure ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assit the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.      Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only o patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.      We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems. Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,8856659,R01LM011663,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Antibodies ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' dreaming ', ' Dreams ', ' Electronics ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' neu Genes ', ' erbb2 [{C0242957}] ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' Human EGF Receptor 2 Gene ', ' HER2/neu ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2 ', ' HER/2 ', ' HER-2 Genes ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' ERBB2 ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Herceptin ', ' Roche brand of trastuzumab ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Genomics ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,452719,PA-18,0.28895286356373545
"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years). This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.",Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification,8826571,R01CA160205,"['Age ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Left ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Scheme ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' young woman ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2015,226815,OK-04,0.26604206832112587
"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.          Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.

"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.            ",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,8869631,K24CA194251,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Influentials ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Planning Technic ', ' Planning Methodology ', ' Planning Techniques ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cancer care ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance network ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2015,146019,WI-02,0.20930335391307328
"Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties with cognitive skills such as memory, thinking and attention are very common after breast cancer chemotherapy. These cognitive difficulties have been associated with chemotherapy-related injury to several brain regions, particularly those regions that also tend to be affected by brain aging. There is concern that chemotherapy may accelerate brain aging and increase patients' risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certain previous studies support this concern while others do not and therefore the effect of breast cancer chemotherapy on risk for Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. The proposed research will compare brain anatomy of breast cancer survivors to that of women who later developed Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, we will determine a pattern of brain anatomy that indicates the probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. This pattern, or classifier, will be determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that were obtained for approximately 100 women with Alzheimer's disease compared to MRI scans from a group of approximately 100 healthy, unaffected women. We will then apply the classifier to MRI scans from 108 breast cancer survivors, 67 who received chemotherapy treatment and 41 who did not. Using the machine learning classifier, we will calculate a score for each breast cancer survivor that indicates her probability of developing Alzheimer's disease based on her brain anatomy. We believe that probability scores will be significantly higher in the chemotherapy group compared to the no-chemotherapy group. We will also explore possible predictors of probability score such as demographic, disease, genetic and treatment factors. This project has the potential to improve our ability to identify patients at risk for persistent and/or progressive chemotherapy-related brain injury using a simple, non-invasive five minute MRI scan. This information could potentially inform treatment decision-making and prioritize patients for early intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to improve our understanding regarding the brain changes that occur following breast cancer chemotherapy.

"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9177536,R01EB021360,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residencies ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' case-based ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' clinical practice ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,389204,NC-04,0.21529716332144624
"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q- BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinica trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. Key Words: quantitative breast parenchyma analysis, image-based biomarker, breast cancer risk prediction, full-field digital mammogram (FFDM) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.

"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assit the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.      Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only o patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.      We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems. Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,9067517,R01LM011663,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Antibodies ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' dreaming ', ' Dreams ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' neu Genes ', ' herstatin ', ' erbb2 [{C0242957}] ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' Oncogene ErbB2 ', ' NEU Oncogene ', ' HER2/neu ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2 ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' ERBB2 ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' rhuMAb HER2 ', ' c-erb-2 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb HER2 ', ' Herceptin ', ' HER2 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' Anti-p185-HER2 ', ' Anti-erbB2 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' Anti-erbB-2 ', ' Anti-c-erbB2 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' Anti-c-ERB-2 ', ' Anti-HER2/c-erbB2 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' Anti-ERB-2 ', ' Trastuzumab ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Genomics ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' genomic profiles ', ' individual patient ', ' treatment choice ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,460025,PA-18,0.28895286356373545
"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of

"Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel image-based breast cancer risk factor based on functional behavior of breast fibroglandular tissue that can improve risk stratification of women with mammographically dense breasts. Over 40% of screening-eligible women have mammographically dense breasts, which refers to a high amount of fibroglandular tissue relative to fat on a mammogram. These women are at elevated risk of developing breast cancer, based on a large body of evidence showing density as one of the strongest risk factors, and are increasingly encouraged to discuss their density-related risk with providers. Yet, the discriminatory accuracy of breast density is weak, limiting its usefulness in clinical risk prediction. We postulate that mammographic density does have importance in risk assessment, with the critical caveat that not all dense tissue confers equivalent risk. Because mammography creates an anatomic depiction of the breast, it is inherently unable to distinguish the known functional heterogeneity of breast fibroglandular tissue among women that likely has important implications in regards to breast cancer risk. We propose that functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue or level of background parenchymal uptake (BPU) that can be assessed on molecular breast imaging (MBI) exams allows for a non-invasive means for determining the subset of women with dense tissue who are at greatest risk of developing breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will establish a retrospective cohort study of 3300 women who had screening MBI performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester between the years 2004 - 2015. MBI exams, mammograms, and medical history information will be obtained; assessments of BPU and mammographic density from existing imaging will be performed; and incident breast cancers in the cohort will be identified via the Mayo Clinic tumor registry and mailed follow-up. In Aim 2, we will use this well-characterized cohort to examine the association of BPU (assessed both categorically and quantitatively) and breast cancer risk. Cox proportional-hazards regression will be employed in a multivariable model with adjustments for covariates, including mammographic density. An exploratory analysis of the interaction between BPU and mammographic density will also be performed using a Gradient Boosting Machine learning algorithm. We hypothesize that high BPU will be associated with increased cancer risk relative to low BPU, beyond the association observed between density and risk. We will also explore whether BPU stratifies the risk associated with dense breasts. This work is the first evaluation of BPU on MBI as a breast cancer risk factor and the first investigation into whether functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue can discriminate risk of mammographically dense tissue. For increasing numbers of women who are now undergoing MBI for supplemental breast screening, this additional risk information will be valuable in guiding clinical decisions regarding tailored screening and risk-reduction options. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of women in the U.S. who are eligible for screening mammography, 43% or 27.5 million are estimated to have mammographically dense breasts - a factor strongly associated with increased breast cancer risk. Yet, mammographic density has limited discriminatory accuracy to be useful for risk assessment. We propose that assessment of the functional behavior of dense tissue, as imaged by a molecular breast imaging (MBI) exam, can identify the subset of women with dense breasts who are at the greatest risk of developing breast cancer, and therefore are most likely to benefit from increased surveillance or preventive risk-reduction options.",Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor,9139431,R21CA197752,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Masks ', ' Radiology-Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Lobular ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Evaluation ', ' Relative Risks ', ' uptake ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Metabolic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' functional status ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Appearance ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Preventive ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' tumor registry ', ' Population ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' Hormone use ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2016,242078,MN-01,0.3679421823435475
"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65. Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.",Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations,9057470,R01CA165229,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Logic ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma,9133341,R01CA199996,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' Archives ', ' Attention ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Collagen ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Glycoproteins ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' Microscopy ', ' Milk ', ' mortality ', ' Needles ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Noise ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Proteins ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Stains ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Tissue Banking ', ' base ', ' density ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Aspirate ', ' Aspirate substance ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Image Guided Biopsy ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Width ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin ', ' H and E ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Mammary Carcinoma ', ' Breast Carcinoma ', ' Structure ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer.

"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9110927,K24CA194251,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Influentials ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Planning Technic ', ' Planning Methodology ', ' Planning Techniques ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cancer care ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance network ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' support tools ', ' personalized strategies ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2016,147059,WI-02,0.20930335391307328
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,9136773,U01CA184902,"['dimethylbenz(a)anthracene ', ' DMBA ', ' dimethylbenzanthracene ', ' Malignant Adenoma ', ' Adenocarcinoma ', '

"SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema  Many breast cancer survivors face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from breast cancer related lymphedema (hereafter, lymphedema), which causes abnormal swelling and multiple distressing and sometimes extremely painful symptoms. These symptoms have been linked to clinically detrimental outcomes, such as disability and psychological distress, both of which are known risk factors for breast cancer survivors' poor quality of life. More importantly, lymphedema symptoms may indicate an early stage of lymphedema that constitutes only minimal changes in objective measures of limb volume. Without timely intervention in this early disease stage, lymphedema can progress into a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions at present can cure. Yet, current clinical practice largely relies on clinicians' observation of swelling and current research methods for detecting and assessing lymphedema are cumbersome and not effective in detecting early stage of lymphedema. Thus, early detection of lymphedema based on symptoms and early intervention for lymphedema symptom management may play an important role in reducing the patient's risk for chronic lymphedema. The first primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to understand the association between symptoms and other relevant personal and clinical factors and the presence of lymphedema, and develop a web-based self-assessment platform that enables patients to assess their risk for lymphedema from anywhere. The second goal is to develop a Kinect-sensor based training system to improve the effectiveness of training for patients to learn and practice the intervention lymphatic exercises developed by the Pl Fu, which have shown great promise in reducing the risk of chronic lymphedema by maintaining pre-surgery limb volume, and relieving lymphedema symptoms. The proposed solutions empower breast cancer survivors to take control of their progression path of lymphedema, and will be integrated into our current IT-based self-care platform for lymphedema symptom management and lymphedema risk reduction, which focuses on preventive, proactive, evidence-based, person-centered approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Lymphedema, which causes multiple painful symptoms, is a major health problem that affects more than 40% of 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the US. This project will develop a self-assessment platform for . early detection of lymphedema and a Kinect-based exercise training system to enhance early intervention. The project has the potential to relieve lymphedema symptoms and reduce the risk for chronic lymphedema.

"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy that will lead to maximal psychosocial adjustment.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.

"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,9016496,R01CA166269,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Calibration ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Matched Case-Control Study ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Frequencies ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' screening ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' Patient risk ', ' imaging platform ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Claiming more than 40,000 lives in the United States in 2015, breast cancer presents an important health focus. Mammography and ultrasound, current screening methods, suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value, respectively, particularly in patients with dense breast tissues. Therefore, a non-invasive method of distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions that could be incorporated with current screening modalities is critically needed. With more advanced screening methods, there is an increase in the detection of early malignant lesions, for which breast-conserving treatment has become more routine. However, intraoperative frozen-section margin assessment is time consuming and suffers from low sensitivity, while post-operative histological analysis leaves potential for positive margins, strongly correlated with reoccurrence. Therefore, a real-time method to detect tumor margins intraoperatively is critically needed. We propose using spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging combined with a clinically- translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker (B7-H3) to non-invasively distinguish normal from malignant tissues both during screening (aim 1) and intraoperatively during surgical resection (aim 3). The sensitivity of this imaging method will be increased with the use of machine learning post-processing algorithms to autonomously detect molecular B7-H3 signal (aim 2). In summary, this proposal will result in significant change to current clinical breast imaging and surgical resection practice to improve the detection and treatment of focal breast lesions. The training portion of this plan, required to accomplish these research goals, has been designed with trainee mentors with specific technical expertise. Dr. Willmann is an expert in translational molecular imaging and contrast agent use, while Dr. Rubin is an expert in bioinformatics, image processing, and machine learning for medical imagine purposes. Additionally, the project is supported by a diverse advisory committee with experts in clinical breast imaging (Dr. Debra Ikeda), optical imaging and intraoperative guidance (Dr. Christopher Contag), and clinical breast surgery (Dr. Irene Wapnir). To date, the candidate has developed expertise in photoacoustic, ultrasound, and fluorescence molecular imaging and molecular contrast agent development and in vivo use during her graduate and postdoctoral research. Her long term career goals include developing clinically translatable combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging methods combined with novel contrast agents for cancer detection and differentiation. Additionally, her research will focus on developing machine learning algorithms for increasing the sensitivity of the molecular imaging approach as well as adapting her method for therapeutic purposes. In preparation for her independent research career, the training plan includes formal education in machine learning, digital signal processing, optical imaging, and cancer biology, as well as in career development classes and ethical conduct of research. Narrative Mammography and ultrasound used for breast cancer screening suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value in women with dense breast tissue (40%).

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for

"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assit the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.      Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only o patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.      We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems. Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,9281905,R01LM011663,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' dreaming ', ' Dreams ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' neu Genes ', ' herstatin ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' Oncogene ErbB2 ', ' NEU protein ', ' NEU Oncogene ', ' HER2/neu ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2 ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' ERBB2 ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Genomics ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' genomic profiles ', ' individual patient ', ' treatment choice ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' genomic data ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,460025,PA-18,0.28895286356373545
"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9297263,K24CA194251,"['Adoption ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Influentials ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' cancer care ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' implementation science ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance network ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' support tools ', ' personalized strategies ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' clinical translation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2017,173648,WI-02,0.20930335391307328

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q- BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinica trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. Key Words: quantitative breast parenchyma analysis, image-based biomarker, breast cancer risk prediction, full-field digital mammogram (FFDM) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for

"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy that will lead to maximal psychosocial adjustment.

"Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Project Summary Even though invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of the breast cancer seen in the US, there remains much to be learned about the unique nature of this disease. For example, patients with ILC are likely to have tumors with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a biomarker of good prognosis. Yet, patients with ER+ ILC have worse long-term outcomes compared to patients with the more commonly studied subtype of ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The standard treatment regimen for ER+ disease includes endocrine therapy, so the big picture focus of this grant asks: why do some ILC patients have a worse outcome than expected on endocrine therapy, and for those patients, what additional treatments can we provide? This grant aims to assess the effect of FGFR4 expression on cell survival and signaling in vitro, identify biomarkers for FGFR4 activation in silico, and test the efficacy of FGFR4 inhibition on clinical samples ex vivo. Methods include 1) FGFR4 inhibition with shRNAs and small-molecule inhibitors, 2) RNA-Sequencing, 3) machine-learning, and 4) explant models of ILC patient tumors. The ultimate goal of the proposed aims is to provide rationale for specific combination targeted therapy in patients with lobular breast cancer, in accordance with the mission statement of the NCI. Project Narrative The goal of this research is to identify why endocrine therapy has lasting benefits for only a subset of women with breast cancer. The proposed studies include RNA-Sequencing to understand how molecular changes impact survival outcomes.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of

"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,9350254,U01CA184902,"['dimethylbenz(a)anthracene ', ' DMBA ', ' dimethylbenzanthracene ', ' Malignant Adenoma ', ' Adenocarcinoma ', '

"Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus Project Summary The ultimate goal of this research is to define the mechanisms through which specific endocrine and genetic risk factors contribute to breast cancer development. The focus of this proposed study is Emca4, a genetic determinant of susceptibility to 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer in the rat that has been mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7). Data presented herein indicate that Emca4 harbors multiple genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility that are orthologous to breast cancer risk loci mapped to chromosome 8q24.21. Also presented are novel data that indicate that a risk prediction model based on genotype across the Emca4 orthologous regions in the human genome can accurately distinguish cases from controls in a previously characterized case/control cohort. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to identify the cell types in which and the mechanisms through which the Emca4 variants influence development of mammary cancer. The knowledge gained will be translate to studies of human derived biospecimens to assess relevance of the data emerging from the rat models. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms through which Emca4.1 determines susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The genes upon which the Emca4.1 variants act will be identified in defined mammary cell populations. Aim 2 is to define the mechanism through which Emca4.4 influences mammary cancer susceptibility and modifies the actions of Emca4.1. The molecular bases of the epistatic interactions between Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 on mammary cancer susceptibility and the cellular and molecular phenotypes regulated by Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 will be defined. Specific Aim 3 is to define the function(s) of Pvt1 in the rat mammary gland and its role in mammary cancer development. Attention will be focused on functionally characterizing Pvt1 promoters and exons that are impacted by endocrine and genetic factors or differ between matched normal and neoplastic mammary/breast tissues. Novel, physiologically relevant, rat models of E2-induced mammary cancer will be utilized in this research. Successful completion of the proposed studies proposed is expected to identify the cell types in which the actions of the Emca4 variants on mammary cancer susceptibility are exerted, the specific gene product(s) that confers the actions of the Emca4 variants in those cell types, and the downstream biological processes that are influenced by the functional orthologs that reside within Emca4. The information generated in these studies is expected to advance our understanding of the etiology of the luminal breast cancer subtypes. Relevance to public health: This proposed research utilizes novel and physiologically relevant rat models of 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer to define the mechanisms and sites of action of “functional orthologs” that reside within the Emca4 mammary cancer susceptibility locus in rat and the genetically orthologous 8q24 breast cancer risk locus in humans. By genetically linking the Emca4/8q24 functional orthologs to the biological processes that influence development of E2-induced mammary cancer, these studies will enhance our knowledge of how genetic and endocrine factors interact to influence normal mammary gland biology and mammary cancer susceptibility and will lay the foundation for development of novel strategies for breast cancer risk prediction and prevention.","Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus",9311738,R01CA204320,"['Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Human Chromosomes ', ' Chromosome 7 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7 ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Exons ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Translating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell type ', ' Endocrine ', ' cancer risk ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' PVT1 gene ', ' PVT1 ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Mammary gland ', ' mammary ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Orthologous Gene ', ' Ortholog ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' Rat Strains ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' 8q24 ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Transcript ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neoplastic ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' rat genome ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' gene product ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' Oncoproteins ', ' Oncogene Proteins ', ' Oncogene Products ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,418643,WI-02,0.16618630794382852
"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9321997,R01EB021360,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' case-based ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' clinical practice ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,396791,NC-04,0.21529716332144624
"SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema  Many breast cancer survivors face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from breast cancer related lymphedema (hereafter, lymphedema), which causes abnormal swelling and multiple distressing and sometimes extremely painful symptoms. These symptoms have been linked to clinically detrimental outcomes, such as disability and psychological distress, both of which are known risk factors for breast cancer survivors' poor quality of life. More importantly, lymphedema symptoms may indicate an early stage of lymphedema that constitutes only minimal changes in objective measures of limb volume. Without timely intervention in this early disease stage, lymphedema can progress into a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions at present can cure. Yet, current clinical practice largely relies on clinicians' observation of swelling and current research methods for detecting and assessing lymphedema are cumbersome and not effective in detecting early stage of lymphedema. Thus, early detection of lymphedema based on symptoms and early intervention for lymphedema symptom management may play an important role in reducing the patient's risk for chronic lymphedema. The first primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to understand the association between symptoms and other relevant personal and clinical factors and the presence of lymphedema, and develop a web-based self-assessment platform that enables patients to assess their risk for lymphedema from anywhere. The second goal is to develop a Kinect-sensor based training system to improve the effectiveness of training for patients to learn and practice the intervention lymphatic exercises developed by the Pl Fu, which have shown great promise in reducing the risk of chronic lymphedema by maintaining pre-surgery limb volume, and relieving lymphedema symptoms. The proposed solutions empower breast cancer survivors to take control of their progression path of lymphedema, and will be integrated into our current IT-based self-care platform for lymphedema symptom management and lymphedema risk reduction, which focuses on preventive, proactive, evidence-based, person-centered approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Lymphedema, which causes multiple painful symptoms, is a major health problem that affects more than 40% of 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the US. This project will develop a self-assessment platform for . early detection of lymphedema and a Kinect-based exercise training system to enhance early intervention. The project has the potential to relieve lymphedema symptoms and reduce the risk for chronic lymphedema.

"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q-BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinical trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens. This will be a step towards the development of personalized medicine and reducing the overall health care costs.",Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk,9537234,U01CA195599,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Counseling ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk Management ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution ', ' Tissue Distribution ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Epithelial ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Descriptor ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Contralateral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' data modeling ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' individual patient ', ' cancer markers ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,377811,MI-12,0.3541177567608274
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these

"SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema  Many breast cancer survivors face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from breast cancer related lymphedema (hereafter, lymphedema), which causes abnormal swelling and multiple distressing and sometimes extremely painful symptoms. These symptoms have been linked to clinically detrimental outcomes, such as disability and psychological distress, both of which are known risk factors for breast cancer survivors' poor quality of life. More importantly, lymphedema symptoms may indicate an early stage of lymphedema that constitutes only minimal changes in objective measures of limb volume. Without timely intervention in this early disease stage, lymphedema can progress into a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions at present can cure. Yet, current clinical practice largely relies on clinicians' observation of swelling and current research methods for detecting and assessing lymphedema are cumbersome and not effective in detecting early stage of lymphedema. Thus, early detection of lymphedema based on symptoms and early intervention for lymphedema symptom management may play an important role in reducing the patient's risk for chronic lymphedema. The first primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to understand the association between symptoms and other relevant personal and clinical factors and the presence of lymphedema, and develop a web-based self-assessment platform that enables patients to assess their risk for lymphedema from anywhere. The second goal is to develop a Kinect-sensor based training system to improve the effectiveness of training for patients to learn and practice the intervention lymphatic exercises developed by the Pl Fu, which have shown great promise in reducing the risk of chronic lymphedema by maintaining pre-surgery limb volume, and relieving lymphedema symptoms. The proposed solutions empower breast cancer survivors to take control of their progression path of lymphedema, and will be integrated into our current IT-based self-care platform for lymphedema symptom management and lymphedema risk reduction, which focuses on preventive, proactive, evidence-based, person-centered approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Lymphedema, which causes multiple painful symptoms, is a major health problem that affects more than 40% of 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the US. This project will develop a self-assessment platform for . early detection of lymphedema and a Kinect-based exercise training system to enhance early intervention. The project has the potential to relieve lymphedema symptoms and reduce the risk for chronic lymphedema.

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast

"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients. Our team will develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and will share these tools with cancer researchers and pathologists on a publicly available platform.",A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis,9601493,U01CA231782,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carcinoma ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Color ', ' E-learning ', ' web-based training ', ' web-based instruction ', ' virtual learning ', ' virtual education ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' online learning ', ' online education ', ' multimedia learning ', ' internet-based training ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' electronic learning ', ' eLearning ', ' digital learning ', ' digital education ', ' computer-based training ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Marketing ', ' Mastectomy ', ' Mammectomy ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Second Opinions ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Slide ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Atypia ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' digital ', ' imaging informatics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Breast biopsy ', ' imaging system ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U01,2018,339842,WA-07,0.13550973214082734
"Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Claiming more than 40,000 lives in the United States in 2015, breast cancer presents an important health focus. Mammography and ultrasound, current screening methods, suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value, respectively, particularly in patients with dense breast tissues. Therefore, a non-invasive method of distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions that could be incorporated with current screening modalities is critically needed. With more advanced screening methods, there is an increase in the detection of early malignant lesions, for which breast-conserving treatment has become more routine. However, intraoperative frozen-section margin assessment is time consuming and suffers from low sensitivity, while post-operative histological analysis leaves potential for positive margins, strongly correlated with reoccurrence. Therefore, a real-time method to detect tumor margins intraoperatively is critically needed. We propose using spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging combined with a clinically- translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker (B7-H3) to non-invasively distinguish normal from malignant tissues both during screening (aim 1) and intraoperatively during surgical resection (aim 3). The sensitivity of this imaging method will be increased with the use of machine learning post-processing algorithms to autonomously detect molecular B7-H3 signal (aim 2). In summary, this proposal will result in significant change to current clinical breast imaging and surgical resection practice to improve the detection and treatment of focal breast lesions. The training portion of this plan, required to accomplish these research goals, has been designed with trainee mentors with specific technical expertise. Dr. Willmann is an expert in translational molecular imaging and contrast agent use, while Dr. Rubin is an expert in bioinformatics, image processing, and machine learning for medical imagine purposes. Additionally, the project is supported by a diverse advisory committee with experts in clinical breast imaging (Dr. Debra Ikeda), optical imaging and intraoperative guidance (Dr. Christopher Contag), and clinical breast surgery (Dr. Irene Wapnir). To date, the candidate has developed expertise in photoacoustic, ultrasound, and fluorescence molecular imaging and molecular contrast agent development and in vivo use during her graduate and postdoctoral research. Her long term career goals include developing clinically translatable combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging methods combined with novel contrast agents for cancer detection and differentiation. Additionally, her research will focus on developing machine learning algorithms for increasing the sensitivity of the molecular imaging approach as well as adapting her method for therapeutic purposes. In preparation for her independent research career, the training plan includes formal education in machine learning, digital signal processing, optical imaging, and cancer biology, as well as in career development classes and ethical conduct of research. Narrative Mammography and ultrasound used for breast cancer screening suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value in women with dense breast tissue (40%). Here, combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging used with a clinically-translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker and novel machine learning based spectral recognition algorithms are explored for noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant lesions and for intraoperative tumor margin assessment. The project is supported by excellent mentors, Drs. Willmann and Rubin, and a diverse advisory committee, Drs. Contag, Ikeda, and Wapnir, and proposes an extended training plan including formal and informal learning opportunities, to aid the PI on her transition to independent faculty.",Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization,9491822,K99EB023279,"['absorption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Digital Signal Processing ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Fluorescent Dyes ', ' fluorescent dye/probe ', ' Fluorescent Agents ', ' Fluorescence Agents ', ' Frozen Sections ', ' Freeze Sectioning ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Indocyanine Green ', ' Wofaverdin ', ' Ujoveridin ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9495679,K24CA194251,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Influentials ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' cancer care ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' implementation science ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance network ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' support tools ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized strategies ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' personalized decision ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' clinical translation ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2018,322232,WI-02,0.20930335391307328
"Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer,9526827,K99CA218667,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Eosine Yellowish ', ' Tetrabromofluorescein ', ' Eosin ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Project Summary Even though invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of the breast cancer seen in the US, there remains much to be learned about the unique nature of this disease. For example, patients with ILC are likely to have tumors with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a biomarker of good prognosis. Yet, patients with ER+ ILC have worse long-term outcomes compared to patients with the more commonly studied subtype of ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The standard treatment regimen for ER+ disease includes endocrine therapy, so the big picture focus of this grant asks: why do some ILC patients have a worse outcome than expected on endocrine therapy, and for those patients, what additional treatments can we provide? This grant aims to assess the effect of FGFR4 expression on cell survival and signaling in vitro, identify biomarkers for FGFR4 activation in silico, and test the efficacy of FGFR4 inhibition on clinical samples ex vivo. Methods include 1) FGFR4 inhibition with shRNAs and small-molecule inhibitors, 2) RNA-Sequencing, 3) machine-learning, and 4) explant models of ILC patient tumors. The ultimate goal of the proposed aims is to provide rationale for specific combination targeted therapy in patients with lobular breast cancer, in accordance with the mission statement of the NCI. Project Narrative The goal of this research is to identify why endocrine therapy has lasting benefits for only a subset of women with breast cancer. The proposed studies include RNA-Sequencing to understand how molecular changes impact survival outcomes. Results of this and future research will complement findings from ongoing clinical trials to identify the best combination of targeted therapy for each individual with breast cancer.",Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma,9410934,F30CA203154,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor ', ' Fibroblast Growth Regulatory Factor ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Gene Family ', ' FGF ', ' Endothelial Cell Growth Factor ', ' DNA Synthesis Factor ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' In Vitro ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Woman ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Family ', ' FGFR ', ' FGF-R ', ' FGF Receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical ', ' Lobular ', ' Lobular Breast Carcinoma ', ' Lobular Adenocarcinoma ', ' Lobular Carcinoma ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Dependence ', ' Endocrine ', ' experience ', ' Estrogen Receptor alpha ', ' Estrogen Receptor α ', ' Estradiol Receptor α ', ' Estradiol Receptor alpha ', ' ERα ', ' ERalpha ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' FGFR4 gene ', ' TKF Gene ', ' JTK2 Gene ', ' FGFR4 ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' infiltrating duct carcinoma ', ' invasive ductal carcinoma ', ' invasive ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' infiltrating ductal carcinoma ', ' infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' overexpression ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' efficacy testing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' transcriptome ', ' targeted agent ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' survival outcome ', ' 3D culture ', ' 3D cell culture ', ' three dimensional cell culture ', ' clinical development ', ' translational cancer research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2018,45339,PA-18,0.24646633069633278
"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9501713,R01EB021360,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' case-based ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' clinical practice ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,368596,NC-04,0.21529716332144624
"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,9578200,R01CA229811,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' TP53 gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' TRP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' P53 ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' TDLU ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' senescent ', ' senescence ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nanostring ', ' nano-string ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2018,640367,FL-04,0.13809827422587517
"Interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Abstract This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using state-of-the-art voice- controlled intelligent assistants to deliver automated cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) for breast cancer survivors (BCS), who suffer from higher rates of insomnia than the general population. Insomnia has numerous detrimental health consequences and too few well- trained CBT-I therapists are available to offer treatment. The user will interact with voice recognition through spoken voice dialogs with an internet-connected speaker instead of a computer and keyboard. The long-term goal is to provide acceptable CBT-I with voice recognition instead of cumbersome, in-person visits or web-based, bright computer screens. In our specific aims, our multidisciplinary team will invite breast cancer survivors with insomnia to inform development of a voice-accessible prototype. We will build and debug the prototype before conducting feasibility testing to assess the prototype’s acceptability with BCS. The central hypothesis is that the majority of participants will report satisfaction with the intervention and express interest in using it for CBT-I at home. We also anticipate that participants will gain knowledge of CBT-I and insomnia treatment through interaction with the device. This intervention includes engaging and educational elements, and multiple areas of innovation which overcome current impediments to the delivery of scalable, automated CBT-I. We anticipate that the results will demonstrate feasibility, and will provide data to inform a Phase II study testing the efficacy of the CBT-I system on insomnia through a randomized controlled trial as well as more feedback on usability of the system throughout development. This contribution is significant, because successful completion of Phase I aims will demonstrate how this product might advance the effective implementation of an evidence-based therapy that can scale to the growing population of breast cancer survivors with insomnia who lack access to trained CBT-I therapists.

"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy that will lead to maximal psychosocial adjustment.

"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls.

"Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer,9653164,K99CA218667,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Tetrabromofluorescein ', ' Eosin ', ' Eosine Yellowish ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Kinetics ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast

"Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to assess the impact of built environments on changes in BMI, physical activity and cancer-related biomarkers in two successful weight loss interventions in women at In 2018, 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected. The Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program, funded by NIEHS and NCI, identified a need to better understand environmental exposures to inform cancer prevention efforts. Further, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) employ temporal and spatial cues to prompt behavior change, but little is known about spatial predictors of behaviors at the minute level and beyond home neighborhoods. Two successful weight loss trials in women at risk for breast cancer, conducted in harmony under the NCI-funded Transdisciplinary Research and Energetics in Cancer Center, offer a unique opportunity to examine the health impacts of changing environmental exposures in a heterogeneous sample. One trial focused on older breast cancer survivors, the other on women across the age range at increased breast cancer risk due to their obesity status. The studies included numerous identical measures at baseline and 6 months, including biomarkers, GPS and accelerometer measurements, and perceived environment surveys. We propose to investigate the relationship between minute level objective GIS measured walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments and changes in BMI, physical activity (PA), and cancer related biomarkers. Few studies have assessed the impact of the built environment on weight loss interventions using objective daily measures, and none included biomarkers of cancer risk. Further, no studies have employed novel GPS measures of total environment exposure that can change as behaviors change in an intervention. Assessing the effects of built environments on intervention outcomes and investigating changes in exposure over time will provide more causal evidence to inform the policy agenda. Most data on built environment and health are cross sectional. We need longitudinal, causal evidence to support policy changes in urban design that will have lasting impact on large population groups and those at risk, recommended by the WHO, IOM and CDC. In addition, we will use estimates of exposure change from the current study to simulate the potential impact of JITAIs and to identify decision points, decision rules and tailoring variables for future interventions. The current study will geocode each GPS coordinate (42 million), integrate built environment data on walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments in GIS using validated integrated data analysis techniques, and investigate whether the environment influences changes in biomarkers, BMI and PA. The Ecological model posits that factors at the individual, interpersonal, and community level can influence behavior and health. These analyses will assess the multi-level predictors, while adjusting for interpersonal and individual covariates. Results will be disseminated to existing community partners from cancer, aging and transportation planning to inform local advocacy efforts. This study will also inform future RCTs controlling for individual and environmental predictors at baseline and inform JITAIs by developing and testing minute level spatial, temporal and behavioral rules. Women in two weight loss interventions changed their behavior overtime. We will assess how the environment around them may have affected their behaviors to inform future studies that use spatial cues to prompt behavior change.","Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to

"Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance. Project Narrative Breast cancer is not one disease, but instead, represents multiple diseases. Each of these unique subtypes requires a different therapeutic approach, thus, determining which new drugs will benefit each disease subtype is critical. To address this need, we are focusing on one of the most therapeutically difficult to treat breast cancer subtypes, namely Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC). We also propose to develop a mathematical representation of a key growth regulating pathway (i.e. EGFR-MAPK) that will predict its activity in TNBC patients, and thus could be used to guide therapies to those patients who have this pathway active within their tumors. We will ultimately test our predictive model on human tumors coming from clinical trials, and if successful, we will have developed a new biomarker for guiding TNBC patient treatments through the use of objective mathematical models",Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,9729382,U01CA238475,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant

"Molecular Analysis of Residual Breast Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death (PMID: 25651787). According to the WHO, breast cancer incidence rose 20% between 2008 and 2012, with 1.7M global diagnoses in 2012. More than 40,000 women died from breast cancer in the U.S. in 2016. Residual disease is important because breast cancer patients with positive margins have a high risk of recurrence and disease-specific mortality. Some studies indicate a surprisingly high risk from positive margins: patients with positive margins have a higher risk of recurrence than patients who have micrometastases to 10 lymph nodes. The elevated risk from positive margins continues to persist even in an era where lumpectomy patients are treated with radiotherapy and systemic therapies. In fact, the increased risk from positive margins is not reduced by additional chemo or a radiation boost. These findings underscore the continued importance of identifying positive margins, especially when clinical trial data will be used to evaluate emerging therapies or compare treatment efficacies. Improving the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer depends on clinical trials, which must account for confounding clinical variables like residual disease. Evidence-based medicine depends on the quality of the underlying data that are used to evaluate therapeutic options and perform comparative efficacy studies. Unfortunately, existing tests are not reliable enough to accurately and reproducibly detect residual disease. Inaccurate tests contribute to confusion and conflicting trial results. This goal of this project is to establish an improved test for residual breast cancer. This work builds on extensive development and validation of a panel of biomarkers that distinguishes tumors from healthy samples. This project will continue our transition from discovery platforms to a technology that is already widely used in clinical labs. Improved testing would improve clinical trials by identifying high-risk patients, allow researchers to ask fundamental questions about breast cancer treatments, and compare treatment efficacies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Detection of minimal residual disease for liquid tumors has undergone two revolutions: from microscopy to flow cytometry, and then from flow cytometry to nucleic acid tests.

"Home-based Virtual Reality System for the Treatment of Chemotherapy-related Cognitive Impairments PROJECT SUMMARY Objectives: To develop a computer-based cognitive training system for breast cancer survivors who are suffering from cognitive impairments subsequent to chemotherapy. A home-based system will be developed, targeting executive functions, attention and memory cognitive domains. The system will incorporate a novel low-cost biosensor device. Specific Aims: 1) Development, validation and usability evaluation of the integrative therapy system; 2) Feasibility study on breast cancer survivors with lasting cognitive impairments post chemotherapy. Methods: 1) Develop a biosensor system to detect cognitive load variation during game play; 2) Validation study of the biosensor prototype; 3) Develop therapeutic games with focus on cognitive intervention; 4) System integration; 5) Develop cloud-based database and remote monitoring software; 6) Conduct a usability study of the system with 4 individuals; 7) Sample standardized outcome measures at pre-treatment, post- treatment and at follow up on 12 breast cancer survivors post-chemotherapy. The primary outcome measures will be cognitive metrics of executive function (Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), NAB Attention Module, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (CFL), Trail Making Test, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised (HVLT-R), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, Revised (BVMT-R). One standard deviation difference in score will be considered a clinically important change. For attention primary outcomes will be NAB Digit Span and Dots for attention, and for memory HVLT-R and BVMT-R scores. Secondary outcomes will be biosensor data, game performance (scores, error rates, intensity of play), changes in activities of daily living, and depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd Ed); 8) Conduct a feasibility clinical trial with 12 breast cancer survivors post chemotherapy and their 12 caregivers. The cancer survivors will be randomized into two groups: experimental treatment (n=6) and sham treatment (n=6). The treatment group will use the biosensor device with custom games, while the sham group will use a laptop with mock up headband with only occupancy/contact sensors. By detecting the wearing of the headband, sham group's total session time will be matched to the experimental group, detected and logged by computer software. 9) Analyze adherence to protocol and outcome data using descriptive and multivariate regression analysis to determine motor functional improvements, cognitive benefits and group changes in cognitive load.

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q-BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinical trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Spectral X-ray Volumetric Imaging for Enhanced Cancerous and Healthy Tissue Differentiation in Breast Tumor Specimens Abstract Clarix Imaging Corporation (Clarix) is focused on solving one of the largest problems in early stage breast cancer treatment, reoperations for positive margins. About 25% of the >200,000 patients who undergo lumpectomy in the US each year will face this additional procedure because current options for identifying positive margins intraoperatively are insufficient. Currently physicians rely on 2D specimen imaging for assessing margin status during surgery which cannot adequately represent the 3D margin morphology. Therefore, Clarix is developing a novel volumetric specimen imager, VSI, device that yields fully 3D images of the specimen with isotropic resolution which can significantly improve margin assessment and provide precise guidance for immediate re-excision before closing wound. We have previously demonstrated the ability of our VSI patented algorithms to overcome long scan times of conventional 3D imagers that would disrupt surgical workflow, and are now proposing development of a novel, algorithm-enabled spectral VSI system to further differentiate cancerous from healthy tissue. Recent developments by our founders allow for spectral CT with no special hardware. The addition of spectral imaging to our VSI system will enable automated cancer delineation in margin assessment improving surgical accuracy and pathologic assessment, and can also be applied to in vivo breast imaging. In the Phase I project we set out to demonstrate proof-of-concept of differentiation between breast tumors and healthy tissue using spectral image reconstruction tailored to VSI. The Specific Aims are to (1) create and validate simulated spectral VSI data of breast cancer specimens, (2) verify the robustness of the spectral VSI algorithm for breast cancer specimens, and (3) verify that spectral VSI can enable breast tumor delineation in patient specimens. Reaching the above Aims will firmly establish the feasibility of spectral CT for cancer differentiation further establishing Clarix VSI as the technical leader in the fast-growing specimen imaging market. Project Narrative Women who undergo lumpectomy for breast cancer have close to a 1 in 4 chance of needing a repeat operation because cancer was left in their breast. Providing surgeons with imaging tools in the operating room can increase rates of complete cancer removal in the first surgery. 2D mammograms of surgical specimens can already be taken in the operating room, but overlying tissue in a 2D image commonly masks the tumor. Clarix Imaging Corporation is developing 3D CT Volumetric Specimen Imager (VSI) to address these challenges providing surgeons with more actionable information. The focus of this project is to incorporate spectral imaging into the VSI to allow for increased differentiation between cancerous and healthy tissues.",Spectral X-ray Volumetric Imaging for Enhanced Cancerous and Healthy Tissue Differentiation in Breast Tumor Specimens,9847765,R43CA239930,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carcinoma ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Chicago ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Media ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Histology ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' image reconstruction ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Marketing ', ' Masks ', ' Mammectomy ', ' Mastectomy ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Palpation ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physics ', ' Privatization ', ' Ramp ', ' Reoperation ', ' Repeat Surgery ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sales ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' soft tissue ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' Performance ', ' attenuation ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' breast lumpectomy ', ' Lumpectomy ', ' Local Excision Mastectomy ', ' Limited Resection Mastectomy ', ' Property ', ' cancer surgery ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Address ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Tissue Differentiation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' wound ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' Cancerous ', ' commercial application ', ' tumor ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' operation ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' spectrograph ', ' spectrum imagery ', ' spectrum image ', ' spectral imagery ', ' spectral image ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' imager ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NCI,CLARIX IMAGING CORPORATION,R43,2019,224881,IL-07,0.22979199510148013
"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls.

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations.

Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,9739251,R01CA229811,"['active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nano-string ', ' nanostring ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' random forest ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification trees ', ' regression trees ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' ROC Curve ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' TRP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' P53 ', ' TP53 gene ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Measures ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' TDLU ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2019,619727,FL-04,0.13809827422587517
"Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus Project Summary The ultimate goal of this research is to define the mechanisms through which specific endocrine and genetic risk factors contribute to breast cancer development. The focus of this proposed study is Emca4, a genetic determinant of susceptibility to 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer in the rat that has been mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7). Data presented herein indicate that Emca4 harbors multiple genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility that are orthologous to breast cancer risk loci mapped to chromosome 8q24.21. Also presented are novel data that indicate that a risk prediction model based on genotype across the Emca4 orthologous regions in the human genome can accurately distinguish cases from controls in a previously characterized case/control cohort. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to identify the cell types in which and the mechanisms through which the Emca4 variants influence development of mammary cancer. The knowledge gained will be translate to studies of human derived biospecimens to assess relevance of the data emerging from the rat models. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms through which Emca4.1 determines susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The genes upon which the Emca4.1 variants act will be identified in defined mammary cell populations. Aim 2 is to define the mechanism through which Emca4.4 influences mammary cancer susceptibility and modifies the actions of Emca4.1. The molecular bases of the epistatic interactions between Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 on mammary cancer susceptibility and the cellular and molecular phenotypes regulated by Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 will be defined. Specific Aim 3 is to define the function(s) of Pvt1 in the rat mammary gland and its role in mammary cancer development. Attention will be focused on functionally characterizing Pvt1 promoters and exons that are impacted by endocrine and genetic factors or differ between matched normal and neoplastic mammary/breast tissues. Novel, physiologically relevant, rat models of E2-induced mammary cancer will be utilized in this research. Successful completion of the proposed studies proposed is expected to identify the cell types in which the actions of the Emca4 variants on mammary cancer susceptibility are exerted, the specific gene product(s) that confers the actions of the Emca4 variants in those cell types, and the downstream biological processes that are influenced by the functional orthologs that reside within Emca4. The information generated in these studies is expected to advance our understanding of the etiology of the luminal breast cancer subtypes. Relevance to public health: This proposed research utilizes novel and physiologically relevant rat models of 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer to define the mechanisms and sites of action of “functional orthologs” that reside within the Emca4 mammary cancer susceptibility locus in rat and the genetically orthologous 8q24 breast cancer risk locus in humans. By genetically linking the Emca4/8q24 functional orthologs to the biological processes that influence development of E2-induced mammary cancer, these studies will enhance our knowledge of how genetic and endocrine factors interact to influence normal mammary gland biology and mammary cancer susceptibility and will lay the foundation for development of novel strategies for breast cancer risk prediction and prevention.","Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus",9637239,R01CA204320,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Human Chromosomes ', ' Chromosome 7 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7 ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Exons ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Translating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell type ', ' Endocrine ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' PVT1 gene ', ' PVT1 ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Mammary gland ', ' mammary ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Orthologous Gene ', ' Ortholog ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Rat Strains ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' 8q24 ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Transcript ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' neoplastic ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' rat genome ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' gene product ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' Oncoproteins ', ' Oncogene Proteins ', ' Oncogene Products ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' risk prediction model ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,406083,WI-02,0.16618630794382852
"Development of a High-Throughput Three-Dimensional H&E Platform for the Characterization of Breast Cancer Biopsies PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this project is to develop a prognostic imaging tool for breast cancer that can be used to predict specific clinical outcomes such as tumor reoccurrence and drug resistance based upon a tumor’s histomorphology features. The current histopathology paradigm for evaluating tissues is focused on diagnosing disease wherein these same tissues if evaluated in their entirety and digitized, provide an opportunity to correlate clinical outcomes to specific tissue features. Through this project, we are developing a high- throughput breast tumor imaging approach that is capable of imaging breast tumor tissue in its entirety and generating virtual H&E optical Z sections in 3D of equivalent quality to traditional H&E sections so that all of the cells within a biopsy are characterized. To achieve this objective, we are combining our patented tissue clearing approach with fluorescent labeling, high-content confocal microscopy and an unbiased machine learning approach. This approach allows for biopsies to be digitized in their entirety and for all of the features and heterogeneity of tumors to be assessed instead of just looking at a few ultra-thin 2D slides. Through the combination of this unique imaging approach with hierarchical agglomerative clustering, specific histomorphological features can be correlated to clinical outcomes using a detailed sample library with corresponding clinical outcome data. The main objectives of this project are to 1) develop a robust 3D H&E labeling approach, 2) demonstrate that tissues can be imaged in 3D using a fluorescent approach to generate “H&E-like” images of equivalent quality to traditional H&E and 3) show that this tissue analysis approach can be transferred to an automated high- content confocal microscope. Additionally, we will show the ability to cluster tissues based on their histomorphological features and will with a small data set of 34 breast tumor biopsies show how these features are correlated to clinical outcomes. If successful, we will develop this proof-of-concept into a robust CLIA 21 CFR Part 11 compliant assay that complies with the ICH guidelines for analytical assays. This assay would ultimately allow clinicians to better predict how a tumor will respond to certain treatments and best tailor a treatment for a specific patient. This type of precision medicine approach will lead to improved patient outcomes and a more efficacious treatment regimen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop a prognostic imaging tool for breast cancer that evaluates breast tumor tissues in their entirety in 3D and uses a machine learning based approach to predict specific clinical outcomes such as tumor reoccurrence and drug resistance.

"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for

"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9724474,R01EB021360,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residencies ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' case-based ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' clinical practice ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,469394,NC-04,0.21529716332144624
"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening.

"Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Project Summary Even though invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of the breast cancer seen in the US, there remains much to be learned about the unique nature of this disease. For example, patients with ILC are likely to have tumors with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a biomarker of good prognosis. Yet, patients with ER+ ILC have worse long-term outcomes compared to patients with the more commonly studied subtype of ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The standard treatment regimen for ER+ disease includes endocrine therapy, so the big picture focus of this grant asks: why do some ILC patients have a worse outcome than expected on endocrine therapy, and for those patients, what additional treatments can we provide? This grant aims to assess the effect of FGFR4 expression on cell survival and signaling in vitro, identify biomarkers for FGFR4 activation in silico, and test the efficacy of FGFR4 inhibition on clinical samples ex vivo. Methods include 1) FGFR4 inhibition with shRNAs and small-molecule inhibitors, 2) RNA-Sequencing, 3) machine-learning, and 4) explant models of ILC patient tumors. The ultimate goal of the proposed aims is to provide rationale for specific combination targeted therapy in patients with lobular breast cancer, in accordance with the mission statement of the NCI. Project Narrative The goal of this research is to identify why endocrine therapy has lasting benefits for only a subset of women with breast cancer. The proposed studies include RNA-Sequencing to understand how molecular changes impact survival outcomes. Results of this and future research will complement findings from ongoing clinical trials to identify the best combination of targeted therapy for each individual with breast cancer.",Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma,9609432,F30CA203154,"['differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' targeted agent ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' survival outcome ', ' three dimensional cell culture ', ' 3D culture ', ' 3D cell culture ', ' clinical development ', ' translational cancer research ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Fibroblast Growth Regulatory Factor ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Gene Family ', ' FGF ', ' Endothelial Cell Growth Factor ', ' DNA Synthesis Factor ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' In Vitro ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Woman ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Family ', ' FGFR ', ' FGF-R ', ' FGF Receptors ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical ', ' Lobular ', ' Lobular Carcinoma ', ' Lobular Breast Carcinoma ', ' Lobular Adenocarcinoma ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Dependence ', ' Endocrine ', ' experience ', ' Estrogen Receptor alpha ', ' Estrogen Receptor α ', ' Estradiol Receptor α ', ' Estradiol Receptor alpha ', ' ERα ', ' ERalpha ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' FGFR4 gene ', ' TKF Gene ', ' JTK2 Gene ', ' FGFR4 ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' infiltrating duct carcinoma ', ' invasive ductal carcinoma ', ' invasive ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' infiltrating ductal carcinoma ', ' infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' tumor ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' efficacy testing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2019,50016,PA-18,0.24646633069633278
"Predicting Long-Term Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment ABSTRACT Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects an estimated 60% of patients, negatively impacting quality of life. Currently, there is no established method for predicting which patients will develop CRCI. This information could be practice-changing by assisting clinicians with treatment decision-making for individual patients. We have shown that the brain network (“connectome”) is significantly altered in patients with CRCI. Therefore, we measured the connectome is patients prior to any treatment and demonstrated that these connectome properties could be used in combination with machine learning to predict 1 year post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment with 100% accuracy. The proposed project aims to test this preliminary prediction model in a new, larger sample with the overarching goal of validating its use for clinical practice. We will enroll 100 newly diagnosed patients with primary breast cancer scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy who will be assessed prior to any treatment, including surgery with general anesthesia, 1 month after chemotherapy treatment and again 1 year later. We will also enroll matched healthy female controls who will be assessed at yoked intervals. We will combine these data with retrospective data we obtained during a prior study for a total sample of 150 in each group. Data from healthy controls will be used to determine impairment status in patients with breast cancer and to provide a template of typical connectome organization for comparison. We hypothesize that our machine learning model will accurately predict 1 year post- chemotherapy cognitive impairment and that it will be more accurate than a model that includes patient- related and medical variables alone. We will also examine longitudinal changes in connectome organization associated with impairment subtypes (i.e. persistent vs. late onset impairment) as well as changes in specific functional networks (e.g. default mode, salience, executive-attention and sensory- motor networks). This information will provide novel insights regarding the neural mechanisms of CRCI and may also help us refine our prediction models. RELEVANCE A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to validate a model for predicting who will develop long-term cognitive impairment and to examine the underlying causes of this impairment.

"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy that will lead to maximal psychosocial adjustment.

"Assessment of Repeatability and Robustness of Radiomics in Breast Cancer Imaging Summary The overall aim of this project is to investigate and better understand the repeatability and robustness of radiomics in breast cancer imaging. Radiomics from medical images can provide information about lesion features such as size, irregularity, and texture, which can be used to produce quantitative image-based phenotypes that can assist in diagnosis of cancer and assessment of treatment. Using previously acquired radiomics measurements of breast cancer imaged by full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and magnetic resonance (MR), Aim 1 of this study is to assess their repeatability using three classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and Bayesian neural network methods), bootstrapping for variability assessment, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) methods. By doing so, we will be able to evaluate how radiomics may be expected to vary in their output and performance on FFDM and MR. In Aim 2, we endeavor to understand the cross-modality performance of radiomics measurements of lesion cases imaged by both FFDM and MR. This work will provide a new understanding of the robustness of radiomics tumor descriptors compared across two modalities and fulfill a currently unmet need – thus being both novel and significant. Statistical analysis will be conducted using superiority and non-inferiority testing. These studies will provide a better understanding of the repeatability and robustness of radiomics of breast lesion images, an important step in establishing their utility in disease diagnosis and treatment assessment. Project Narrative Breast cancer is a significant public health concern; it is estimated that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Radiomics makes use of quantitative image-based phenotypes, also called features, to provide information about the presence of cancer and its response to treatment, which can aid physicians in medical decision making. The overall objective of this study, addresses a currently unmet need and aims to assess the repeatability of radiomics made from mammography and magnetic resonance images of breast cancer and to determine the robustness of radiomics for lesions imaged across two modalities, mammography and magnetic resonance; the aims of this study are designed to contribute to better understanding of the utility and generalizability of the role of radiomics in cancer patient management and precision medicine.",Assessment of Repeatability and Robustness of Radiomics in Breast Cancer Imaging,9654299,R15CA227948,"['Bibliography ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Computers ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' breast ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Mammography ', ' Ultrasonic Mammography ', ' Breast Ultrasonography ', ' Mammary Ultrasonography ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Lesion ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Descriptor ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' breast lesion ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' radiomics ', ' Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Breast MRI ', ' Bayesian neural network ', ' ']",NCI,WHEATON COLLEGE,R15,2019,396673,IL-06,0.2672608930301532
"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients. Our team will develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and will share these tools with cancer researchers and pathologists on a publicly available platform.",A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis,9781678,U01CA231782,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carcinoma ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Color ', ' web-based training ', ' web-based instruction ', ' virtual learning ', ' virtual education ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' online learning ', ' online education ', ' on-line learning ', ' on-line education ', ' multimedia learning ', ' internet-based training ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' electronic learning ', ' eLearning ', ' digital learning ', ' digital education ', ' computer-based training ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' E-learning ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Diagnosis ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Marketing ', ' Mammectomy ', ' Mastectomy ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Second Opinions ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Slide ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Atypia ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' digital ', ' imaging informatics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Breast biopsy ', ' imaging system ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U01,2019,317390,WA-07,0.13550973214082734
"INTEGRATING OMICS AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING DATA IN CO-CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very challenging disease because it is biologically aggressive, there are no targeted therapies, and, consequently, patients have poor prognosis. Although immunotherapy is promising for treating many cancers, TNBC lacks specific molecular targets, no predictive biomarkers to chemotherapy response have yet been identified, and treatment response is difficult to evaluate using current biomarker assessments. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC offer the exciting opportunity of evaluating this disease in terms of molecular features (e.g., genomic copy number, whole exome sequence, and mRNA expression) to identify candidate “omic” biomarkers that best predict the ultimate response to treatment and could provide surrogate endpoints to validate novel imaging biomarkers in co-clinical trial human trails. Moreover, emerging quantitative MRI methods, such as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), contain rich physiological signals in the images for predicting treatment response, but it is challenging to integrate both animal and human data to reliably predict the treatment response. A paradigm of “co-clinical trials” is emerging in which new treatments are evaluated in animals, and the results guide treatments in clinical trials, but there is a paucity of informatics tools and resources to enable analyses in such animal-to-human work. We believe that an informatics-based methodology that integrates molecular `omics' and imaging data will propel advances in TNBC by enabling development of machine learning models to predict the response to therapies. In order to develop research resources that will encourage consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging results for co-clinical trials, we will leverage an ongoing co-clinical trial we are undertaking to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify molecular biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX); (2) Identify quantitative MRI biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts; and (3) Evaluate our informatics tools in a prospective co-clinical trial. Our proposed research is significant and innovative because it leverages advances in basic cancer biology, state-of-the-art imaging technologies, and informatics methods to develop a resource to catalyze discovery in this important disease. Our PDX-based approach will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical methodology and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens for TNBC patients. Our methods and tools will likely also generalize to other cancers and could, therefore, substantially benefit the care of all cancer patients. Project Narrative Determining the optimal therapies for a specific triple negative breast cancer tumor is currently not possible, as the number of possible treatment combinations is too large to evaluate experimentally in clinical trials. Our proposed methods that leverage patient derived xenografts and machine learning analysis of integrated `omics and quantitative imaging data will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical trial approach and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens in these patients.

"The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Racial Disparities in Breast Cancer Biology. ABSTRACT: African-American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European-American (EA) women. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this disparity is a critical unmet need with major public health implications. The tumor immune milieu may play a pivotal role in breast cancer disparities, specifically tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that have roles in oncogenesis and disease progression. Using H&E stained slides from a large epidemiological case-control study, we have discovered that AA women have significantly higher levels of TILs than EA women – especially in the estrogen receptor (ER) negative subgroups. This indicates a distinct biological difference in the tumor immune response related to race and ER status, and also presents a conundrum in which TILs that are often associated with better outcome are higher in AA women, who typically fare worse with breast cancer. These findings indicate that the specific composition of immune cell populations and their spatial arrangement within the tumor environment are likely to be important mitigating factors for the role of TILs in breast cancer progression, and tumor differences between AA and EA women. Our preliminary data from the NanoString PanCancer Immune Panel support this idea by revealing that AA women have gene expression signatures indicative of higher levels of exhausted T cells than EA women, which have a diminished capacity to destroy tumor cells, consistent with the poorer survival observed in AA women. Here, immune gene expression profiles also varied by ER status, pointing to a potential immunoregulatory role of ER in breast cancer.  To date, most studies that examine TILs do so in cohorts of predominantly EA women and in-depth immune profiling studies in large cohorts of AA women are lacking. To address this shortcoming, we will employ multispectral staining and imaging with the Vectra® Quantitative Pathology System to delineate immune cell populations and ER expression in 996 breast cancer samples from the Women's Circle of Health Study. Building on our preliminary data, we propose to evaluate two immunofluorescence panels, each with multiple biomarkers in their spatio-morphological context. While both panels will include ER and a differentiating cytokeratin marker, panel 1 will include four common T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3), and panel 2 will include markers of T cell exhaustion (TIGIT, LAG3, PD-1) that may play a key role in the differential immune response between AA and EA women. Our proposal involves the full implementation of a new generation of biomarker assessment techniques – multiplexed staining, multispectral imaging, automated scoring, and digital spatial analyses. A thorough comparison of the immune landscape in breast tumors in regards to race and ER expression will inform our understanding of immune escape mechanisms, and how these processes differ by ancestry. This will be critical for designing immunotherapy strategies that will equally benefit AA women, serving to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-American women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European- American women and this may be due to biological differences in their tumor immune cells. We will use a sophisticated tumor tissue staining and imaging approach to evaluate the immune cells in breast cancer samples from a large group of predominantly African-American women. Our findings will inform on the abundance and types of immune cells present in breast tumors and may improve cancer immunotherapy strategies for African-American women.",The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating

"Long noncoding RNA regulations in breast cancer among African-American women ABSTRACT Breast cancer rates among African-American (AA) women continue to rise and may further widen breast cancer disparities experienced by AA women, who are more likely to develop aggressive tumor types with a worse prognosis. The biological reasons for these differences remain largely unknown. Recent genome-wide, high-throughput studies highlight an emerging role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a novel class of regulatory molecules in cancer. LncRNAs form an important regulatory layer in global gene expression, and increasing evidence indicates that abnormal expression of specific lncRNAs can contribute to breast cancer carcinogenesis and progression. Studies to date, however, are focused exclusively on EA women, have not commonly used high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) to provide unbiased comprehensive profiling, and mostly do not incorporate rigorous normal tissue controls. Motivated by these research gaps and limitations, we recently completed a pilot study of genome-wide lncRNA expression profiling in normal and tumor breast tissues from AA and EA women. LncRNA expression data showed clear tissue- and subtype- specific expression patterns. Importantly, we noted a number of differentially abundant lncRNAs between AA and EA women by estrogen receptor (ER) status. These results indicate that there are unique lncRNA expression patterns in AA tumors, which we hypothesize contributes to aggressive tumor biology and high breast cancer-related mortality. We propose a cost-effective study in a well-characterized cohort of AA breast cancer patients in the Women’s Circle of Health Study (WCHS), which has available tumor tissue blocks, and extensive data on tumor characteristics, clinical outcomes, treatments received, lifestyle factors, and genome- wide DNA methylation. As such, our Specific Aims are: 1) Perform tissue lncRNA expression profiling using total RNA sequencing (1181 AA cases from WCHS and 100 AA controls from Komen Tissue Bank) to determine lncRNAs that are breast cancer- and ER subtype- specific (tumor, ER+, ER- vs. normal) and those associated with clinico-pathological factors (e.g., grade); 2) Examine associations of lncRNA expression levels with breast cancer survival, and use a machine learning approach to identify a combined panel of lncRNAs associated with breast cancer survival; and further perform computational prediction and in vitro functional assays to determine their biological relevance; and 3) Integrate paired data on lncRNA expression and DNA methylation to determine which of these cancer- and prognosis-relevant lncRNAs are regulated by DNA methylation, and explore whether diet, obesity and other lifestyle-related factors are associated with aberrant DNA methylation. This work is novel and findings are anticipated to advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms contributing to aggressive tumor biology and poor cancer prognosis observed in AA women that can be translated into the development of targeted strategies for prevention and therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) African American (AA) women have a higher risk of being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer and have the highest mortality rate among all racial groups in U.S. women. We will systematically elucidate the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a novel class of regulatory molecules, in breast cancer prognosis in AA women.

"Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic options for metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer Project Summary/Abstract This is an application for a K08 Award to Dr Jennifer Caswell-Jin, an Instructor and breast oncologist at Stanford University establishing a career in translational breast cancer genomic research. The Award will support her career development by providing training in clinical trials, biomarker development, and bioinformatic analysis of multi-omic data under the expert mentorship of Dr Christina Curtis, computational and cancer systems biologist, and Dr George Sledge, breast cancer clinical trialist and translational researcher. The proposed research focuses on the major public health problem of metastatic breast cancer, estimated to affect over 150,000 women and to cause over 40,000 deaths each year in the United States. Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most common subtype. Eight “integrative” subtypes of HR+ breast cancer have been identified based on the integration of genome-wide copy number and expression information in early-stage breast tumors. Four integrative subtypes, together comprising one-quarter of all HR+ early-stage breast cancers, exhibit a very high risk of distant metastasis; each of these subtypes is characterized by a distinct area of the genome that exhibits concomitant copy number gain and overexpression. The studies in this proposal will examine for the first time how integrative subtypes behave after metastasis, with the driving hypothesis that they may derive benefit from personalized therapeutic approaches. Aim 1 is to investigate the biology and impact of integrative subtypes in metastatic HR+ breast cancer. We will develop novel approaches to assess integrative subtypes and will learn whether they change across metastasis, whether they are associated with timing of metastasis, and whether they have differential lengths of response to standard therapies. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effects of a novel combination of targeted therapy in two integrative subtypes of metastatic breast cancer. We will perform a clinical trial that tests a targeted therapeutic approach in tumors classifying as one of two of the four high-risk integrative subtypes. Because these two subtypes are defined by focal areas of genomic alteration involving either the fibroblast growth factor receptor ligand (FGF3; integrative subtype 2) or the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1; integrative subtype 6), we hypothesize that these tumors may benefit from FGFR inhibition. Participants in this trial will receive standard endocrine therapy in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition, as well as an investigational agent that inhibits the fibroblast growth factor receptor pathway. We will also perform tumor biopsies before and during treatment to evaluate for changes that occur with this combination targeted therapy approach. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lay the groundwork for continued efforts to develop a precision oncology approach for metastatic HR+ breast cancer, with next steps to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K08 Award. Project Narrative Metastatic breast cancer, of which hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is the most common, is estimated to affect approximately 150,000 women in the United States; most of these women will die of breast cancer, making it the second leading cause of cancer death among women. This proposal will examine distinct molecular categories of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer to understand whether different treatments may affect these groups differently. The knowledge gained will lay the groundwork for a personalized approach to therapy for metastatic breast cancer to improve health and lengthen life.",Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,9987569,R01CA229811,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' TP53 gene ', ' P53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Measures ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' ER Positive ', ' ER+ ', ' Estrogen receptor positive ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' TDLU ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' senescent ', ' senescence ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nanostring ', ' nano-string ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' random forest ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification trees ', ' regression trees ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2020,721306,FL-04,0.13809827422587517
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER,10168918,R00CA218667,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Eosine Yellowish ', ' Eosin ', ' Tetrabromofluorescein ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health disparities Women of African heritage suffer a higher breast cancer mortality compared to their European counterparts. Though the biologic basis for these disparities remains poorly defined, recent studies suggest definitive roles for biological variation in the gene expression pathways governing tumor behavior and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. The transcription factor Kaiso (ZBTB33) is a gene regulatory factor, found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, that has been functionally linked to racial differences in survival outcome in several epithelial cancers. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to define functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the immmune tumor microenvironment that contribute to racial differences in breast cancer survival. We accomplish this through application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to characterize the Kaiso dependent differences in spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment using multiplex immunofluorescent technologies to profile a unique breast cancer health disparities cohort (Specific Aim One). We then apply this technology to examine the impact of Kaiso disruption on autophagy and the immune tumor microenvironment using a murine orthotopic allograft model for Kaiso depletion in the presence and absence of pharmacologic blockade of autophagy (Specific Aim Two). We then perform a large-scale application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to profile the spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment in 901 racially diverse breast cancer specimens by multiplex immunohistochemistry to define the detailed role of Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment in population-specific differences in breast cancer outcome (Specific Aim Three). Together with a closely integrated multi-disciplinary team of breast cancer pathologists, cancer biologists, computer scientists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticians and data scientists, we will define new prognostic and predictive biomarkers that link Kaiso to tumor progression, the immune tumor microenvironment, breast cancer outcome and how their association differs by race. Elevated expression of the multifunctional transcriptional regulator, Kaiso (ZBTB33) is associated with worse breast cancer survival based on race. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to study a novel breast cancer health disparities cohort to define new functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment that contribute to racially disparate breast cancer outcome.","The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health

"Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus Project Summary The ultimate goal of this research is to define the mechanisms through which specific endocrine and genetic risk factors contribute to breast cancer development. The focus of this proposed study is Emca4, a genetic determinant of susceptibility to 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer in the rat that has been mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7). Data presented herein indicate that Emca4 harbors multiple genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility that are orthologous to breast cancer risk loci mapped to chromosome 8q24.21. Also presented are novel data that indicate that a risk prediction model based on genotype across the Emca4 orthologous regions in the human genome can accurately distinguish cases from controls in a previously characterized case/control cohort. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to identify the cell types in which and the mechanisms through which the Emca4 variants influence development of mammary cancer. The knowledge gained will be translate to studies of human derived biospecimens to assess relevance of the data emerging from the rat models. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms through which Emca4.1 determines susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The genes upon which the Emca4.1 variants act will be identified in defined mammary cell populations. Aim 2 is to define the mechanism through which Emca4.4 influences mammary cancer susceptibility and modifies the actions of Emca4.1. The molecular bases of the epistatic interactions between Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 on mammary cancer susceptibility and the cellular and molecular phenotypes regulated by Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 will be defined. Specific Aim 3 is to define the function(s) of Pvt1 in the rat mammary gland and its role in mammary cancer development. Attention will be focused on functionally characterizing Pvt1 promoters and exons that are impacted by endocrine and genetic factors or differ between matched normal and neoplastic mammary/breast tissues. Novel, physiologically relevant, rat models of E2-induced mammary cancer will be utilized in this research. Successful completion of the proposed studies proposed is expected to identify the cell types in which the actions of the Emca4 variants on mammary cancer susceptibility are exerted, the specific gene product(s) that confers the actions of the Emca4 variants in those cell types, and the downstream biological processes that are influenced by the functional orthologs that reside within Emca4. The information generated in these studies is expected to advance our understanding of the etiology of the luminal breast cancer subtypes. Relevance to public health: This proposed research utilizes novel and physiologically relevant rat models of 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer to define the mechanisms and sites of action of “functional orthologs” that reside within the Emca4 mammary cancer susceptibility locus in rat and the genetically orthologous 8q24 breast cancer risk locus in humans. By genetically linking the Emca4/8q24 functional orthologs to the biological processes that influence development of E2-induced mammary cancer, these studies will enhance our knowledge of how genetic and endocrine factors interact to influence normal mammary gland biology and mammary cancer susceptibility and will lay the foundation for development of novel strategies for breast cancer risk prediction and prevention.","Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus",9860907,R01CA204320,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate

"Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women For the >200,000 older women who develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer yearly, adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for at least five years increases overall survival. Yet almost half of patients prescribed AET fail to take all their pills. Education- and reminder-based studies in this and a number of other settings have had disappointingly small effects on adherence, and more complex interventions have proven difficult to sustain. In this proposal we seek a better understanding of the symptoms that women describe as major barriers to AET adherence. We draw on prior research suggesting that preexisting symptoms may play an important role in patients’ experience with AET. Our proposal fills crucial gaps in our understanding by examining older and less selected subjects treated in a usual care practice, and by using a measure that is already routinely collected across the United States. Specifically, we will use the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s Distress Thermometer (DT) and its accompanying problem list, which have previously been shown to reveal a high burden of symptoms among older women with breast cancer but have not been examined in association with AET or while accounting for the wide spectrum of comorbid conditions of older women. Most cancer centers administer the DT and problem list at diagnosis or earlier in care, increasing their value for informing early intervention to help women continue their AET. We will investigate whether the DT and problem list are predictive of AET discontinuation among older women, with specific aims as follows: Aim 1 To examine the association of patient-reported distress at diagnosis with early discontinuation of AET. We will utilize electronic health record data from a cohort of incident postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients to examine the association of the DT (scored 0 to 10) measured at diagnosis with AET discontinuation in time-to-event analyses, accounting for age, osteoarthritis, and other comorbidities, and other breast cancer treatments. Aim 2. To explore the association of patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis with discontinuation of AET. In the same cohort and using the same general approach, we will explore AET discontinuation and a) patient-reported overall symptom count based on DT problem list) and b) symptom clusters (e.g., fatigue, sleep, concentration). We will use both standard regression and an innovative application of machine learning using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With this approach, we will produce immediately actionable findings to improve adherence outcomes, by providing a means of identifying high-risk patients who are the primary targets for the development of new interventions. It could also be an important model for other conditions that are treated with aggressive treatment regimens in older patients, informing care for a large number of older patients.

"Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating tumor cell aggregation Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pose continuous and persistent threats to create new metastases albeit at an unknown, extremely low efficiency. Compared to single CTCs, clusters of multicellular CTCs possess 20-100 times higher metastatic capacity, create more polyclonal metastasis, and correlate with worse prognosis. Our previous studies identified that in addition to collective migration and cohesive shedding, tumor cell aggregation is a new mechanism for CTC cluster formation, enhancing cancer stemness and polyclonal metastasis. The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CD44 and PAK2-promoted CTC aggregation, identify the drivers of CTC cluster-mediated polyclonal metastasis, and therefore develop proof-of-principle targeting strategies to block lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancer, using multiple human PDXs and CTC lines as well as mouse tumor models. The collaborative team includes Dr. Huiping Liu (Northwestern University) with expertise in CTC and cancer stemness, breast oncologist Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli (Northwestern University), imaging expert Dr. Constadina Arvanitis (Northwestern University), and bioinformaticist and structural biologist Dr. Yang Shen (Texas A & M). Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women and claims about 40,000 lives in the United States every year. Metastasis account for 90% of breast cancer deaths. In order to develop effective treatments against cancer, we need to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying metastasis. Using clinical specimens, patient-derived xenograft models, and other cell line and models along with cutting-edge technology, this project aims to identify a novel mechanism critical for circulating tumor cell cluster formation and targeting strategies to block metastasis, thereby eventually contributing to a reduced mortality rate of breast cancer.",Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating

"Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to assess the impact of built environments on changes in BMI, physical activity and cancer-related biomarkers in two successful weight loss interventions in women at In 2018, 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected. The Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program, funded by NIEHS and NCI, identified a need to better understand environmental exposures to inform cancer prevention efforts. Further, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) employ temporal and spatial cues to prompt behavior change, but little is known about spatial predictors of behaviors at the minute level and beyond home neighborhoods. Two successful weight loss trials in women at risk for breast cancer, conducted in harmony under the NCI-funded Transdisciplinary Research and Energetics in Cancer Center, offer a unique opportunity to examine the health impacts of changing environmental exposures in a heterogeneous sample. One trial focused on older breast cancer survivors, the other on women across the age range at increased breast cancer risk due to their obesity status. The studies included numerous identical measures at baseline and 6 months, including biomarkers, GPS and accelerometer measurements, and perceived environment surveys. We propose to investigate the relationship between minute level objective GIS measured walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments and changes in BMI, physical activity (PA), and cancer related biomarkers. Few studies have assessed the impact of the built environment on weight loss interventions using objective daily measures, and none included biomarkers of cancer risk. Further, no studies have employed novel GPS measures of total environment exposure that can change as behaviors change in an intervention. Assessing the effects of built environments on intervention outcomes and investigating changes in exposure over time will provide more causal evidence to inform the policy agenda. Most data on built environment and health are cross sectional. We need longitudinal, causal evidence to support policy changes in urban design that will have lasting impact on large population groups and those at risk, recommended by the WHO, IOM and CDC. In addition, we will use estimates of exposure change from the current study to simulate the potential impact of JITAIs and to identify decision points, decision rules and tailoring variables for future interventions. The current study will geocode each GPS coordinate (42 million), integrate built environment data on walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments in GIS using validated integrated data analysis techniques, and investigate whether the environment influences changes in biomarkers, BMI and PA. The Ecological model posits that factors at the individual, interpersonal, and community level can influence behavior and health. These analyses will assess the multi-level predictors, while adjusting for interpersonal and individual covariates. Results will be disseminated to existing community partners from cancer, aging and transportation planning to inform local advocacy efforts. This study will also inform future RCTs controlling for individual and environmental predictors at baseline and inform JITAIs by developing and testing minute level spatial, temporal and behavioral rules. Women in two weight loss interventions changed their behavior overtime. We will assess how the environment around them may have affected their behaviors to inform future studies that use spatial cues to prompt behavior change.","Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to

"Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone ABSTRACT Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with 1.6 million new cases and 500,000 BC deaths annually. Patients diagnosed in low- resource settings (LRS) account for half of new cases, and the majority of deaths from BC worldwide. The first critical step to starting life-saving treatment for BC is the accurate and timely pathologic confirmation of a cancer diagnosis, a task which remains challenging in many LRS. Traditional pathology assessment involves processing surgically excised specimens with cell-block methods for: (1) cellular histopathology, which identifies abnormal cellular morphologies indicative of malignancy, and (2) molecular pathology, which identifies tumor biomarkers, specifically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and the proliferation maker Ki67. Breast cancer subtyping using these markers is essential for determining prognosis, as well as for selecting subtype-specific therapies. Unfortunately, histology-based pathology services require a strong pathology infrastructure and trained pathologists, limiting access to these services in many LRS. For example, there are only 15 trained pathologists in Tanzania, a country of over 55 million people. There is hence an urgent need for new methods to accurately diagnose cancer, as well as to analyze expression levels of molecular biomarkers for tumor subtyping. A technology driven solution that could automate cellular pathology with minimal user-intervention and virtually no infrastructure requirements could thus enormously impact the management of breast cancer in LRS. Motivated by this need, the objective of this proposal is to finalize the development of the EpiView-D4 point-of-care test (POCT) to analyze both the cellular and molecular features of breast cancer from needle aspiration specimens. The EpiView component of the device enables easily accessible, low-cost, smart-phone based brightfield cellular imaging of fine needle aspirate breast biopsies without the need for pathologist assessment. In parallel, the D4 POCT component of the device images a point-of-care antibody microarray for the quantification of ER/PR/Her2/Ki67 levels from breast FNA lysate with picomolar sensitivity within 30 minutes at point-of-care, eliminating the need for additional visits before a treatment plan can be initiated. The EpiView-D4 will enable automated readout of both cytopathology and the molecular profiles of breast cancer, using machine learning algorithms integrated into a smartphone application. In this proposal, we will conduct final device development and training of ML algorithms, followed by pre-clinical validation and clinical investigation of the Epiview-D4 POCT, first at Duke University Medical Center, and then in the intended LRS of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center. The impact of this technology lies in its potential to dramatically improve breast cancer management worldwide by enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis and subtyping of breast cancers, thereby driving timely and appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients and hence improving the outcomes for hundreds of thousands of women with BC annually in LRS. PROJECT NARRATIVE In less developed parts of the world, there is an urgent need for accurate and more informative diagnosis of breast cancer as trained pathologists are scarce‚ and pathology infrastructure is often very limited. The proposed research will complete the currently ongoing development of a cell-phone based device that: (1) images cells from breast tumors and analyzes them by software to identify whether a person has breast cancer, and (2) measures levels of clinically-relevant protein biomarkers to help guide treatment. If successful, this technology can be widely by health care workers to provide the same level of care in low-resource settings as is currently available in the US and will thereby save many

"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer.

"Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment ABSTRACT  Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States, despite the advances made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer treatment. Mammographic reporting is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal mammographic findings such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density can lead to a cancer diagnosis. The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate biopsy decision-making. However, application of the BI-RADS lexicon has resulted in substantial inter-observer variability, including inappropriate term usage and missing data. This observer variability has lead in part to a considerable variation in the rate of biopsy across the US, with a majority of breast biopsies ultimately found to be benign lesions. Hence, there is the need for a system that can better stratify the risk of cancer and define a more optimum threshold for biopsy. To address this need, we propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.  This study aims to develop a well-defined, novel risk assessment system incorporating multi-modality datasets with a novel predictive model that outputs a probability measure of cancer that is more clinically relevant and informative than the six discrete BI-RADS scores. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI- RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a predictive model that is more precise and clinically relevant may be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. Our proposed technique entails a novel strategy using Natural Language Processing to extract pertinent clinical risk factors related to breast cancer from vast amounts of patient charts automatically and integrate them with corresponding image-omics data and radiologist- generated reports. We will extract and quantitate image features from both large amounts of mammography and breast ultrasound images and combine them with the radiology reports and pertinent clinical risk profile and other patient characteristics to generate a risk assessment score to aid radiologists and oncologists in breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decisions. Such a web-based application tool will be the first breast cancer risk assessment system based on integrative radiomics data augmented by AI methods. The iBRISK tool will enhance engagement between the patient and clinician for making an informed decision on whether or not to biopsy.  Our hypothesis is that BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics contain significant features for the breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decision-making. By using BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics, we will be able to develop new metrics to better breast cancer risk assessment. The novelty of the breast cancer risk assessment system is that it will incorporate a new predictive model that deploys deep learning and AI technology to provide a more reliable stratification of the BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies and patients’ anxiety. Project Narrative  We propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI-RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a more precise and clinically relevant predictive model will be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. The more reliable stratification of BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment will reduce the number of unnecessary breast biopsies and save billions of dollars in medical costs annually.",Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment,10028242,R01CA251710,"['Anxiety ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Female ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Clinical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk Management ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Mammary Ultrasonography ', ' Breast Ultrasonography ', ' Ultrasonic Mammography ', ' Ultrasound Mammography ', ' breast ultrasound ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Calcified ', ' calcification ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"INTEGRATING OMICS AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING DATA IN CO-CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very challenging disease because it is biologically aggressive, there are no targeted therapies, and, consequently, patients have poor prognosis. Although immunotherapy is promising for treating many cancers, TNBC lacks specific molecular targets, no predictive biomarkers to chemotherapy response have yet been identified, and treatment response is difficult to evaluate using current biomarker assessments. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC offer the exciting opportunity of evaluating this disease in terms of molecular features (e.g., genomic copy number, whole exome sequence, and mRNA expression) to identify candidate “omic” biomarkers that best predict the ultimate response to treatment and could provide surrogate endpoints to validate novel imaging biomarkers in co-clinical trial human trails. Moreover, emerging quantitative MRI methods, such as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), contain rich physiological signals in the images for predicting treatment response, but it is challenging to integrate both animal and human data to reliably predict the treatment response. A paradigm of “co-clinical trials” is emerging in which new treatments are evaluated in animals, and the results guide treatments in clinical trials, but there is a paucity of informatics tools and resources to enable analyses in such animal-to-human work. We believe that an informatics-based methodology that integrates molecular `omics' and imaging data will propel advances in TNBC by enabling development of machine learning models to predict the response to therapies. In order to develop research resources that will encourage consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging results for co-clinical trials, we will leverage an ongoing co-clinical trial we are undertaking to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify molecular biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX); (2) Identify quantitative MRI biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts; and (3) Evaluate our informatics tools in a prospective co-clinical trial. Our proposed research is significant and innovative because it leverages advances in basic cancer biology, state-of-the-art imaging technologies, and informatics methods to develop a resource to catalyze discovery in this important disease. Our PDX-based approach will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical methodology and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens for TNBC patients. Our methods and tools will likely also generalize to other cancers and could, therefore, substantially benefit the care of all cancer patients. Project Narrative Determining the optimal therapies for a specific triple negative breast cancer tumor is currently not possible, as the number of possible treatment combinations is too large to evaluate experimentally in clinical trials. Our proposed methods that leverage patient derived xenografts and machine learning analysis of integrated `omics and quantitative imaging data will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical trial approach and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens in these patients.

"Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance. Project Narrative Breast cancer is not one disease, but instead, represents multiple diseases. Each of these unique subtypes requires a different therapeutic approach, thus, determining which new drugs will benefit each disease subtype is critical. To address this need, we are focusing on one of the most therapeutically difficult to treat breast cancer subtypes, namely Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC). We also propose to develop a mathematical representation of a key growth regulating pathway (i.e. EGFR-MAPK) that will predict its activity in TNBC patients, and thus could be used to guide therapies to those patients who have this pathway active within their tumors. We will ultimately test our predictive model on human tumors coming from clinical trials, and if successful, we will have developed a new biomarker for guiding TNBC patient treatments through the use of objective mathematical models",Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,9928400,U01CA238475,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant

"Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk SUMMARY Risk of developing contralateral breast cancer is a major concern among breast cancer survivors, especially for those who received radiotherapy for a first primary breast cancer. The risk of developing radiation-associated contralateral breast cancer (RCBC) is further increased among those who were exposed to radiation at an early age. Several genotyping studies have shown that variation in the individual risk of developing RCBC is associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic variants. However, these studies have mainly analyzed a limited set of target/candidate SNPs that had been associated with general primary breast cancer in prior studies. This approach, building predictive models based on a small set of SNPs, has made marginal progress in distinguishing individual risk of RCBC. To the contrary, complex phenotypes or traits are likely the result of interactions of many biological sub-systems, most of which individually provide small effect size to predictive models, incrementally improving risk prediction. We have recently developed novel machine learning methods that use genome-wide SNPs to build patient-specific risk models of radiation-induced toxicity. These models use hundreds of SNPs in a nonlinear fashion and can be used to identify key biological correlates. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinical decision support tool that can be used to guide radiotherapy treatment decisions based on individual risk of RCBC. To improve patient-specific risk prediction of RCBC, we propose to apply these innovative methods to a rich dataset of the Women’s Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. Under SA1: Genome-wide genotyping of the WECARE Study II, as part of this grant, we will complete genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotyping of 1626 samples from the WECARE Study II. Under SA2.1: Predictive modeling and biological analysis, we will apply our novel machine learning methods to the combined WECARE Study I and II to design a predictive model of RCBC risk in a young subpopulation treated with radiotherapy, using GWAS genotyping, clinical, and radiation data. We will also use bioinformatics methods to identify key biological correlates associated with RCBC risk. Under SA2.2: Comparison of biological correlates between subgroups, we will further investigate biological processes associated with radiation-unrelated contralateral breast cancer for the combined cohort in the WECARE Study I and II who did not receive radiotherapy. The resulting biological correlates will be compared with those found in SA2.1 for radiotherapy-treated women to better understand RCBC-specific biological mechanisms. Our model validation using an independent series of childhood cancer survivors who have developed radiation-associated breast cancer will enable us to examine the reliability and reproducibility of the model as a decision-making tool. If the RCBC risk model is validated, it will provide a clinical guide to identify high-risk patients who may need altered radiotherapy techniques (e.g., proton therapy), which offer reduced scatter dose. NARRATIVE Young women who receive radiotherapy are at increased risk for radiation-associated breast cancer. We have developed innovative modeling methods to build a predictive model of radiation-associated breast cancer risk based on patient genetic profiles using the unique, multi- center WECARE Study dataset for this study. If successful with rigorous validation on an independent dataset, this project will result in a clinical tool that could be used to inform breast cancer treatment decisions for young women at increased risk of radiation-associated breast cancer.",Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk,9878491,R21CA234752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Decision Making ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Female ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Methods ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Radiation Scattering ', ' Woman ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' proton therapy ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' environmental radiation ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' dosimetry ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Radiation-Induced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Radiation-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' radiation related cancer ', ' radiation related neoplasm/cancer ', ' Radiation-Induced Cancer ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Environment-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Environmental Cancer ', ' Environmental Malignant Neoplasm ', ' environment related cancer ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Dose ', ' Age-Years ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Childhood Cancer Survivor Study ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' Validation ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genetic profiling ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pediatric cancer survivor ', ' childhood cancer survivor ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biological systems ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Cancer survivor ', ' model building ', ' support tools ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' Contra-lateral Breast ', ' Contralateral Breast ', ' radiation risk ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' random forest ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2020,293870,NY-12,0.3100926777370203
"Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating tumor cell aggregation Project Summary Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pose continuous and persistent threats to create new metastases albeit at an unknown, extremely low efficiency. Compared to single CTCs, clusters of multicellular CTCs possess 20-100 times higher metastatic capacity, create more polyclonal metastasis, and correlate with worse prognosis. Our previous studies identified that in addition to collective migration and cohesive shedding, tumor cell aggregation is a new mechanism for CTC cluster formation, enhancing cancer stemness and polyclonal metastasis. The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CD44 and PAK2-promoted CTC aggregation, identify the drivers of CTC cluster-mediated polyclonal metastasis, and therefore develop proof-of-principle targeting strategies to block lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancer, using multiple human PDXs and CTC lines as well as mouse tumor models. The collaborative team includes Dr. Huiping Liu (Northwestern University) with expertise in CTC and cancer stemness, breast oncologist Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli (Northwestern University), imaging expert Dr. Constadina Arvanitis (Northwestern University), and bioinformaticist and structural biologist Dr. Yang Shen (Texas A & M). Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women and claims about 40,000 lives in the United States every year. Metastasis account for 90% of breast cancer deaths. In order to develop effective treatments against cancer, we need to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying metastasis. Using clinical specimens, patient-derived xenograft models, and other cell line and models along with cutting-edge technology, this project aims to identify a novel mechanism critical for circulating tumor cell cluster formation and targeting strategies to block metastasis, thereby eventually contributing to a reduced mortality rate of breast cancer.",Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating

"Risk-based Breast Cancer Screening and Surveillance in Community Practice - Admin Supplement for P3 PROJECT SUMMARY This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA- 20-038. The goals of this supplement are to advance progress toward implementing risk-based imaging surveillance for breast cancer in clinical practice. We propose to improve methodological approaches for developing risk models for breast cancer imaging surveillance outcomes, including surveillance detected second breast cancer (benefit) and interval invasive breast cancer (failure), and inform the development of an optimal risk-based imaging surveillance strategy for individual women with primary breast cancer. This proposal builds on the resources of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) from more than 60,000 women with a personal history of breast cancer and more than 330,000 surveillance mammography examinations. The investigators will leverage modern data-adaptive modeling approaches, specifically regularized regression models and machine learning methods which can potentially enhance prediction accuracy, to develop risk models of surveillance outcomes (Aim 1). The investigators propose a comprehensive internal validation with multiple metrics to evaluate the risk models developed via alternative methods for a full understanding of their utilities and trade-offs between models in improving breast cancer survivorship while maintaining clinical usability and interpretability (Aim 2.1). Specifically, the investigators will evaluate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the calibration of each risk model developed in Aim 1, and conduct comparison across models using net reclassification improvement and variable importance measures. Additionally, an online tutorial created using R Markdown is proposed to accelerate uptake of best practices for modern risk model development and validation in other cancers (Aim 2.2). The evaluation and dissemination of alternative methodological modeling approaches in this supplement will directly inform development of risk-stratified surveillance algorithms in breast and other cancer types. PROJECT RELEVANCE This proposal, combined with work funded under the parent award to model surveillance failure using conventional logistic regression, will accelerate the pace of progress toward generating evidence for risk- guided surveillance strategies, including imaging modalities and follow-up frequencies, tailored for each woman with primary breast cancer. In addition, the proposed methodological investigation of alternative data- adaptive risk modeling approaches is applicable to multiple other cancers. Evaluating the impact of alternative modeling approaches in improving predictive accuracy and comparing trade-offs across modeling approaches will guide more rigorous, thoughtful, and accurate prediction model development to guide clinical decisions about cumulative risk of post-treatment outcomes over time, as well as decisions regarding the frequency of surveillance based on recurrence risk.",Risk-based Breast Cancer Screening and Surveillance in Community Practice - Admin Supplement for P3,10164432,P01CA154292,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Parents ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' interest ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' model development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium ', ' Data ', ' Surveillance Modeling ', ' Community Practice ', ' Validation ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' usability ', ' online tutorial ', ' clinical practice ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' Breast Cancer survivorship ', ' surveillance imaging ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P01,2020,149977,CA-03,0.27075383183913443
"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls. The study will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammograms and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening.",Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening,9954013,R01CA218405,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' mortality ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Appearance ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' Network-based ', ' public health relevance ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' mammography screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' interactive tool ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,357994,PA-18,0.2354171031302795
"Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Project Summary Even though invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of the breast cancer seen in the US, there remains much to be learned about the unique nature of this disease. For example, patients with ILC are likely to have tumors with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a biomarker of good prognosis. Yet, patients with ER+ ILC have worse long-term outcomes compared to patients with the more commonly studied subtype of ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The standard treatment regimen for ER+ disease includes endocrine therapy, so the big picture focus of this grant asks: why do some ILC patients have a worse outcome than expected on endocrine therapy, and for those patients, what additional treatments can we provide? This grant aims to assess the effect of FGFR4 expression on cell survival and signaling in vitro, identify biomarkers for FGFR4 activation in silico, and test the efficacy of FGFR4 inhibition on clinical samples ex vivo. Methods include 1) FGFR4 inhibition with shRNAs and small-molecule inhibitors, 2) RNA-Sequencing, 3) machine-learning, and 4) explant models of ILC patient tumors. The ultimate goal of the proposed aims is to provide rationale for specific combination targeted therapy in patients with lobular breast cancer, in accordance with the mission statement of the NCI. Project Narrative The goal of this research is to identify why endocrine therapy has lasting benefits for only a subset of women with breast cancer. The proposed studies include RNA-Sequencing to understand how molecular changes impact survival outcomes. Results of this and future research will complement findings from ongoing clinical trials to identify the best combination of targeted therapy for each individual with breast cancer.",Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma,9837419,F30CA203154,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor ', ' DNA Synthesis Factor ', ' Endothelial Cell Growth Factor ', ' FGF ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Gene Family ', ' Fibroblast Growth Regulatory Factor ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' In Vitro ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Woman ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ', ' FGF Receptors ', ' FGF-R ', ' FGFR ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Family ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical ', ' Lobular ', ' Lobular Adenocarcinoma ', ' Lobular Breast Carcinoma ', ' Lobular Carcinoma ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Dependence ', ' Endocrine ', ' experience ', ' ERalpha ', ' ERα ', ' Estradiol Receptor alpha ', ' Estradiol Receptor α ', ' Estrogen Receptor α ', ' Estrogen Receptor alpha ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' FGFR4 ', ' JTK2 Gene ', ' TKF Gene ', ' FGFR4 gene ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' infiltrating ductal carcinoma ', ' invasive ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' invasive ductal carcinoma ', ' infiltrating duct carcinoma ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' shRNA ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' efficacy testing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' targeted agent ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' survival outcome ', ' 3D cell culture ', ' 3D culture ', ' three dimensional cell culture ', ' clinical development ', ' translational cancer research ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2020,45273,PA-18,0.24646633069633278
"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy that will lead to maximal psychosocial adjustment.

"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients. Our team will develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and will share these tools with cancer researchers and pathologists on a publicly available platform.",A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis,9997819,U01CA231782,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Color ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Marketing ', ' Mastectomy ', ' Mammectomy ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Second Opinions ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' Slide ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Atypia ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' digital ', ' imaging informatics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Breast biopsy ', ' imaging system ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' feature extraction ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U01,2020,323139,WA-07,0.13550973214082734
