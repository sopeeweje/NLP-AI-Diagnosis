"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",10133760,R01NS110779,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aminocaproic Acids ', ' Antifibrinolytic Agents ', ' Antifibrinolysins ', ' Antifibrinolytics ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Desmopressin ', ' 1-Desamino-8-arginine Vasopressin ', ' Deamino Arginine Vasopressin ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Eptacog Alfa ', ' Factor VII ', ' Proconvertin ', ' Serum Prothrombin Conversion Accelerator ', ' Stable Factor ', ' autoprothrombin I ', ' cothromboplastin ', ' Factor VIIa ', ' Activated Blood Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Activated Factor VII ', ' Coagulation Factor VIIa ', ' Fibrinolysis ', ' Fibrinolyses ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hematoma ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Texas ', ' Thrombelastography ', ' Thromboelastography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Tranexamic Acid ', ' AMCA ', ' AMCHA ', ' t-AMCHA ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' clopidogrel ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Platelet Transfusion ', ' Blood Platelet Transfusion ', ' Plts ', ' Hypomagnesemia ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Survivors ', ' disability ', ' Intuition ', ' Measurement ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' American ', ' metropolitan ', ' Reporting ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' stroke trials ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,609173,IL-07
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,10237248,K08NS109315,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Calcium ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Control Groups ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Forelimb ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Publishing ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' joint mobility ', ' joint movement ', ' joint mobilization ', ' meetings ', ' brain cell ', ' experience ', ' sensory cortex ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' career development ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' rehabilitation research ', ' rehab research ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' stroke recovery ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' disability burden ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' motor recovery ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' imaging study ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2021,213840,CA-33
"Data Harmonization PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the fifth most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. afflicting nearly 800,000 per year. About three quarters of strokes are first events, underscoring the importance of primary prevention. Designing optimal preventive strategies requires identification of risk factors and estimation of the risk of stroke. The most recent American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Primary Prevention of Stroke conclude that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted, and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” One of the most commonly recommended predictive models is the Framingham Stroke Profile, developed and updated more than 25 years ago. Newer models have been proposed (including the Self-Reported Stroke Risk Stratification tool from the REGARDS study) but have not been thoroughly validated. Consequently, the Primary Prevention of Stroke guidelines call for more research “to validate risk assessment tools across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups” and “to evaluate whether any of the more recently identified risk factors add to the predictive accuracy of existing scales”. We propose to address these gaps by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. The data will be obtained through a partnership with the coordinating center for the REGARDS Study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and by a request submitted to the NIH dbGap repository to obtain data from the Framingham Offspring, ARIC and MESA cohorts. At the same time, we will expand the advanced machine learning techniques developed as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to Duke. We will apply these models to the harmonized data to facilitate development and validation of prediction tool for primary strokes. These complex analyses will require advanced computational resources that will utilize the AHA's Precision Medicine Platform (PMP), built based on Amazon Web Services.

"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,10240277,K02NS104207,"['Animals ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dyskinetic syndrome ', ' Abnormal Movements ', ' Dyskinesias ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Standardization ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' user-friendly ', ' stem ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' clinical practice ', ' motor recovery ', ' Data Science ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke model ', ' stroke outcome ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2021,228159,NY-12
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS.

"Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Project Summary: Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common causes of death and permanent disability worldwide, costing the U.S. health system more than $71 billion per year in lost productivity and medical expenses. Existing paradigms for stroke/TBI diagnosis require computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to classify ischemic versus hemorrhagic variants prior to intervention, as treatment for these conditions varies widely. Delays in diagnosis and issues related to transport of unstable patients associated with diagnostic imaging increase the likelihood of neurological injury and death. Translational medical devices that accelerate time-to-treatment in the field or hospital setting may help to reduce morbidity and mortality in stroke/TBI patients on a global level. Our team has developed a portable, rapid and noninvasive imaging and detection device based on eddy current damping (ECD) sensors that can detect brain hemorrhages associated with stroke and TBI, and have demonstrated feasibility in a benchtop, human cadaver and clinical patient setting. This device can potentially diagnose and classify hemorrhagic stroke/TBI subtypes with accurate spatial localization in minutes, rather than hours, thereby guiding early responders and medical providers in making time-sensitive medical decisions for clinical intervention, such as administration of tissue plasminogen activator for ischemic stroke. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel stroke detection device in rapidly triaging stroke/TBI patients and achieving a level of diagnostic accuracy capable of guiding clinical intervention. We hypothesize that: 1) Regional conductivity changes in brain tissue can be imaged and detected using the portable ECD sensor; 2) Hemorrhagic stroke and TBI-related hemorrhages will increase regional conductivity, whereas ischemic stroke will decrease dependent brain conductivity in affected ischemic regions; and 3) Portable stroke imaging may reduce time-to-treatment and diagnosis associated with stroke/TBI. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) Perform benchtop laboratory experiments to further elucidate how direction and magnitude of measured conductivity changes can differentiate stroke subtype and location, 2) Use validated human cadaver stroke simulation models to optimize ECD tri-coil array sensor detection of hemorrhage depth, volume, and location, 3) Utilize machine learning algorithms to quickly classify brain lesions with high accuracy, and 4) Implement early clinical stroke/TBI ECD sensor device testing to gauge effectiveness in live human patients, compared to CT/MR imaging. Development of methods for rapid bedside stroke/TBI diagnosis will provide practitioners with knowledge required to rapidly administer life-saving treatments, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this will help to reduce time-to-treatment and guide triage and intervention, which is likely to translate to improved morbidity and mortality associated with these common conditions. Project Narrative Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are leading causes of major disability and death, and delays in diagnosis and treatment are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Current diagnostic standards in stroke and TBI require that patients undergo computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in a hospital setting to differentiate ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes before initiating treatment. Our study proposes to develop a portable, noninvasive stroke/TBI detection and imaging system based on tri-coil eddy current damping technology, thereby rapidly identifying stroke subtypes, accelerating time-to-treatment, and providing early responders with information necessary to more efficiently administer triaged and appropriate intervention in the field or acute care setting.",Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device,10100064,R01NS119596,"['Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cadaver ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Coma ', ' Comatose ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gelatin ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Morbidity -

"Impact of Clot Histological and Physical Properties on Revascularization Strategies in Acute Ischaemic Stroke - Administrative Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY In the last four years, our group collected >1800 stroke emboli from centers across the US and Canada as part of the Stroke Thromboembolism Registry of Imaging and Pathology (STRIP). The STRIP registry was our current R01 award’s Aim 1 and is very fruitful. We have further elucidated the association between clot histology and revascularization outcomes, as well as clot histology and imaging characteristics. The STRIP registry has also allowed us to uncover novel mechanisms in stroke thrombosis, catalyzing thrombectomy device research and thrombolysis related research in our lab. We believe that the most impactful finding from our registry will be uncovering associations between histopathology of retrieved emboli and stroke etiology. Developing tools to predict stroke etiology is important because nearly 40% of strokes are of unknown etiology. Determine stroke etiology (i.e. cardiac source versus large artery atherosclerosis) is important as secondary stroke prevention strategies are highly dependent on determination of stroke etiology. However, when we performed superficial quantitative analyses examining the relationships between fibrin, platelet, WBC and RBC density, our results were unrevealing. Still, we hypothesize that it remains feasible to predict stroke etiology based of analysis of retrieved stroke emboli through deep learning and machine learning approaches. Machine learning and deep learning approaches can also aid in uncovering histological features associated with device and pharmacological failure related to stroke revascularization. Thus, this administrative supplement’s goal of is to 1) allow for complete digitization and online archiving of our database of over 1800 retrieved clot specimens as well as all available anonymized clinical data from Aim 1 of our current R01 to facilitate deep learning and machine learning and 2) to perform deep learning on the whole slide specimens from these patients to determine if various deep learning and machine learning algorithms can be used to predict stroke etiology based solely off of the histological appearance of retrieved stroke emboli. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute ischemic stroke affects up to 800,000 people per year in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death. Mechanical thrombectomy has become standard of care for acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion and up to 150,000 of these procedures will be performed annually by 2025. The etiology of the stroke is unclear in 30-40% of LVO cases. Understanding etiology is important for secondary stroke prevention strategies. The goal of this project is to predict stroke etiology based off histologic characteristics of retrieved clots using AI/ML techniques. The first step is to render our data AI ready which is the main focus of this administrative supplement.",Impact of Clot Histological and Physical Properties on Revascularization Strategies in Acute Ischaemic Stroke - Administrative Supplement,10410193,R01NS105853,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' aortic arch ', ' aorta arch ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arteries ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Canada ', ' Cause of Death ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Embolism ', ' Embolus ', ' Therapeutic Embolization ', ' Embolization Therapy ', ' Embolotherapy ', ' embolization ', ' Fibrin ', ' Goals ', ' Histology ', ' neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' von Willebrand Factor ', ' Ristocetin Cofactor ', ' Ristocetin-Willebrand Factor ', ' von Willebrand Protein ', ' Work ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Thrombectomy ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Left atrial structure ', ' Left Atrium ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' thrombolysis ', ' extracellular ', ' physical property ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Devices ', ' Appearance ', ' Sampling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' shear stress ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' histological specimens ', ' histological samples ', ' histology samples ', ' histology specimens ', ' online repository ', ' on-line archive ', ' on-line repository ', ' online archive ', ' web repository ', ' web-based repository ', ' atherosclerotic plaque rupture ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,315871,MN-01
"Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers The proposed study will be based on a multimodal approach using 4D flow MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and high-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) together with patient information (demographics and clinical factors) to predict the risk of recurrent stroke of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) stenosis. This will allow integrating the vulnerability of the stenosis as well as the patient by assessing the hemodynamic impact, plaque stability, and stroke lesion pattern together with patient information into a prediction model. PWI will provide tissue perfusion, VWI will provide plaque stability, DWI will provide stroke lesion pattern and 4D flow MRI will provide macroscopic hemodynamics of the circle of Willis (CoW). We will concentrate on the following innovative developments: 4D flow MRI: In order to allow 4D flow MRI scanning with a high dynamic velocity range (necessary to measure slow and fast velocities simultaneously), we recently developed dual-venc 4D flow MRI. However, this method suffers from extended scan tome of an already long acquisition. We, therefore, aim to minimize scan time for dual-venc 4D flow MRI scan while using the required spatial resolution and volume coverage, targeting 5-10 minutes so that this sequence can be added to clinical protocols. We aim to achieve this by integrating compressed sensing acceleration. Rigorous testing of the sequence will be done in phantom experiments as well as in a healthy test-retest control study. Data Analysis and Outcome Prediction: Currently, the multi-modal information that can be acquired with MRI has not been combined and used for comprehensive prediction of recurrent stroke risk in ICAD. Information that can be acquired from different MRI modalities may be critical in characterizing ICAD patient status. We will develop a new analysis tool that combines all data into a single network graph. All imaging data will be reported relative to supplying the intracranial artery of the CoW by using the vascular territory region of interest analysis. This will allow gathering all imaging parameters in a network graph. In a cross-sectional patient study, we will use combined data to see if it enables differentiation between healthy subjects, ICAD subgroups. Patient Study: In Aim 3, we will develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict which of the patients are at risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. In order to achieve this, we will enroll a total of 150 ICAD patients from two institutions (Northwestern Memorial Hospital and San Francisco General Hospital). The combined data from the four different MR modalities and all other patient information will be used to identify only the discriminative features. This will be realized by using support vector machine recursive feature elimination to rank features associated with the risk of an ischemic event. The SVM will be trained and tested using information from the patient's clinical follow-up as outcome measure. The outcome (ischemic event or death yes/no)) will enable the development of the SVM classifier to predict outcome. Project Narrative (2 – 3 sentences) In the proposed study, we will develop an advanced intracranial MRI protocol together with a comprehensive image processing pipeline allowing full characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Imaging biomarkers together with clinical and demographic factors will enable the identification of patients at risk to suffer recurring stroke. Machine learning methods will be used to predict risk. Successful completion will allow for better identification of patients who could benefit from endovascular stenting to reduce stroke recurrence.",Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial

"Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha    Advances in wearable electronics, personal mobile devices, and sensor technology are opening the door to many promising applications in medical care and biomedical research. However, the resulting datasets are often challenging to process due to variability caused by extraneous effects unrelated to the tasks of interest, such as changes in environmental conditions, heteroscedasticity in measurement noise, or patient idiosyncrasies. These effects produce systematic differences between the data used to train machine- learning algorithms and the data on which they are applied in practice, impairing real-world performance. The proposed research will address the fundamental problem of factoring out extraneous effects associated with known nuisance variables. We will develop a novel methodology for extracting features that ar.e invariant to nuisance variables-and hence also to the associated extraneous effects-but that are still useful for classification or regression. The methodology is based on nonparametric deep-network models that perform automatic normalization of the data, and further enforce invariance via adversarial learning. We will apply the approach to an important problem in stroke rehabilitation, the quantitated dosing of motor training. Using a dataset of sensor-based motion data, we will train the model to identify and count functional movements in stroke patients performing rehabilitation activities. We expect to show that our approach can surmount patient variability to enable rigorous movement classification and quantitation. The proposed work is significant, because it will empower investigators to undertake the dosing trials critically needed in stroke rehabilitation. The proposed work is innovative, because it departs from traditional data preprocessing techniques by combining advanced data normalization and model calibration procedures. Our work is likely to have a positive impact on stroke rehabilitation by facilitating the research required to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. Our quantitative approach is broadly generalizable to applications hindered by nuisance variables, such as medical diagnostics and genomics. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise measurement of rehabilitation after stroke. This will facilitate important recovery research that is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability. The quantitative methodology will advance data-driven discovery in the presence of nuisance variables, which is relevant to biomedical research applications such as diagnostics, genetics, and imaging.",Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha   ,10199051,R01LM013316,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Calibration ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Due Process ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' network models ', ' clinical practice ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' patient variability ', ' patient variation ', ' variability between patients ', ' variation between patients ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke outcome ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' ']",NLM,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1,NY-12
"Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals Project Summary/Abstract Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States. Endovascular stroke therapy (EST) has revolutionized the management of large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS), which accounts for a disproportionate amount of disability in stroke. While this therapy has been shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes in multiple clinical trials, these studies nearly all required screening patients with advanced NeuroImaging such as CT Perfusion (CTP), a modality not available to the majority of community hospitals. As such, there is a pressing need to for a tool able to identify EST candidates leveraging the infrastructure already existing in community hospitals. We envision a software-based service to automate the NeuroImaging evaluation for EST using CT angiography (CTA). We developed and tested a prototype of a novel deep neural network architecture called DeepSymNet. Our preliminary data indicate that uniquely using CTAs we can determine (1) the presence or absence of a large vessel occlusion (2) if the extent of ischemic core and (3) volume of tissue “at risk” (penumbra) is above or below the thresholds used in the clinical trials, when compared to concurrently obtained results using CTP. We will pursue our project goal with three aims: - Aim 1 - Establish one of the largest multi-institution dataset for neuro-imaging research in acute ischemic stroke. We will acquire a multi-center dataset including imaging and clinical data from 15 hospitals across Texas and California, from a range of scanners, imaging acquisition protocols, and hospital types (i.e. large academic and smaller community). - Aim 2 - Develop interpretable deep learning models to determine the eligibility for EST. We will methodically test a set of model architectures, data augmentation strategies, loss functions and pre-processing steps based on DeepSymNet. We will train and test the algorithm against various definitions of infarct core and penumbral volume based on CTP results. This approach will allow for models adaptable to the everchanging definition of EST eligibility.  – Aim 3 - Evaluate the external validity of DeepSymNet-based models on a large multi-center independent dataset. To accomplish this aim, we will deploy our DeepSymNet software on patient imaging and data from multiple hospitals, which were not used in the creation of the software. We will also validate our approach of using CTA alone to determine ischemic core by validating blinded reads of infarct core from CTA source images performed by expert readers against concurrently acquired CTP results. Completion of these aims will have a sustained, transformative impact by supporting the creation and validation of decision support tools readily translatable to the patient bedside in the vast majority of community hospitals across the country. In doing so, we hope to expand the access to high-quality EST screening to thousands of additional AIS patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE With endovascular stroke therapy, we now have the ability to dramatically improve patient outcomes after stroke. To date, however, screening for patients that may benefit from this procedure has been relegated to larger academic centers, as the advanced imaging modalities required for this evaluation are not widely available. The goal of our proposal is to develop and validate machine learning-based software tools to identify patients eligible for endovascular stroke therapy using CT angiography, an imaging modality readily available in the vast majority of community hospitals.",Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals,10184809,R01NS121154,"['post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' loss of function ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' screening ', ' community center ', ' support tools ', ' Industry Standard ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' patient screening ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' Patient imaging ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' tool ', ' Intravenous ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Dependence ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' brain tissue ', ' thrombolysis ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' referral center ', ' biomedical referral center ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Institution ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Therapy Evaluation ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,481432,TX-09
"Massively high-throughput profiling of the circulating antibody pool for identification of diagnostic signatures with utility for stroke triage PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Stroke is currently the third leading cause of death and leading cause of permanent disability in the United States. Due to the time-efficacy relationship associated with acute stroke interventions, tools which allow for accurate stroke diagnosis during triage have the potential to streamline care and improve patient outcomes. Early transport, transfer, and referral decisions are often made by emergency medical services personnel, triage nurses, and emergency physicians with limited neurological expertise using symptom-based stroke recognition scales. Unfortunately, these assessments exhibit limited accuracy in triage scenarios, and it is currently estimated that up to 30% of patients experiencing stroke are misdiagnosed at first clinician contact, leading to life threatening delays in care. As a result, there has been a push for the identification of stroke-specific blood biomarkers which could be rapidly measured at the point-of-care to help clinicians without extensive neurological expertise make better-informed early triage decisions. It is becoming increasingly evident that the peripheral immune system is intricately involved in stroke pathology, and may be targetable for the development of stroke diagnostics. Not only is there a rapid systemic inflammatory response to the acute injury, but emerging evidence suggests that peripheral immune changes may precede symptom onset and in some cases trigger the acute event itself. The peripheral blood contains up to 1018 unique antibodies targeting antigens associated with nearly every adaptive immune response an individual has experienced in their lifetime, and the repertoire of antibodies found in an individual’s blood can serve as a detailed molecular fingerprint of their immune history as well as current immune status. In the proposed investigation, we aim to identify stroke-associated alterations to the circulating antibody pool which could be used to aid in stroke recognition during triage. To address this aim, peripheral blood will be sampled from a group of consecutive patients suspected of stroke at emergency department admission. Upon final clinical diagnosis, patients will be divided into either a confirmed stroke group or a stroke mimic group. Peptide arrays comprised of 330,000 unique probes will be used to comprehensively assess the binding characteristics of each patient’s peripheral blood antibody pool, and a machine-learning approach will be used to identify a pattern of binding which can optimally discriminate between groups. This work will be the first ever to take a comprehensive approach to profiling the circulating antibody pool in stroke to globally search for disease-specific patterns of alterations; the level of throughput, in combination with the use of powerful machine-learning methods, will increase the odds of identifying diagnostically robust biomarker profiles. Furthermore, diagnostically useful probes identified via peptide array can be readily adapted for use at the point-of-care, providing a clear path to clinical use. This novel, innovative, and highly translational workflow will address an area of dire clinical need; we fully expect to identify a set of candidate peptide probes which will provide the immediate foundation for the development of a rapid point-of-care stroke triage diagnostic. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Quick and confident recognition of stroke at initial clinician contact increases the odds of successful treatment and positive outcome. The proposed clinical study aims to identify patterns of molecular changes in the immune system that are associated with stroke. If successful, the work will lay the immediate groundwork for the development of a rapid blood test that could be used to aid in stroke diagnosis.",Massively high-throughput profiling of the circulating antibody pool for identification of diagnostic signatures with utility for stroke triage,10302835,R21NR019337,"['Ambulances ', ' Antibodies ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Play ', ' Prehospital Emergency Care ', ' Pre-hospital emergency care ', ' Proteins ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Troponin ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immunological markers ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' peripheral blood ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' immunological status ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Proteome ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Immune Targeting ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' stroke intervention ', ' symptom science ', ' symptom cluster ', ' clinical translation ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' clinical implementation ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' stroke patient ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' antibody detection ', ' antibody based detection ', ' detect antibodies ', ' point-of-care detection ', ' ']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,201250,OH-11
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,10135698,R01HD071686,"['Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Computers ', ' Electrodes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Recovery ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' behavior change ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' skills ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' theories ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' forging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' neural patterning ', ' neurofeedback ', ' network architecture ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' arm movement ', ' Learning Skill ', ' stroke survivor ', ' high dimensionality ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke model ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,415784,PA-18
"Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform Project Summary / Abstract  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. Most recovery of functional impairments occurs within the first few weeks after stroke and plateaus thereafter. Unfortunately, even after patients reach a stable phase of recovery, their functional level of the stroke-affected limb may decline. Therefore, it is clinically important to maintain the regained functional level beyond the first couple weeks of spontaneous recovery by continuing to practice the use of the affected limb during daily living.  Wearable technologies have emerged as a low-cost, objective tool to monitor the performance of the upper limbs during activities of daily living (ADLs). However, to date, there exists no study that has investigated the effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) system aiming to enable high-dosage motor performance in chronic stroke survivors in the real-world setting. Specifically, the optimal configuration of the goal setting, feedback mechanism and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) remains unknown.  This proposal aims to develop and validate an mHealth technology that aims to encourage affected limb use during the performance of ADLs in chronic stroke survivors. To accomplish this goal, we will employ the unique finger-worn ring sensor (accelerometer), developed by our academic-industry partnership, that can capture both gross-arm and fine-hand use of the limbs that are essential in the performance of ADLs. We will study important aspects of making positive behavior changes to encourage the affected limb use by fully leveraging the computational insights drawn from sensor data combined with clinical insights from providers.  To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on the development of an mHealth platform, composed of body-networked sensors and cloud-based systems, to monitor the real-world use of the limbs in chronic stroke survivors. In Aim 2, we will develop machine-learning based algorithms to extract clinically meaningful information regarding real-world upper limb use from sensor data. Aim 3 will investigate the optimal design of our mHealth system – such as individual tailoring of the goal, design of the feedback, medium and timing to deliver feedback, and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) – via human-centered design approaches. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the short-term (8 weeks) effectiveness of the mHealth system in improving the use of the affected limb through a field deployment study.  We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable a high dosage of physical and occupational therapy, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. It is clinically important that stroke survivors continue to practice the use of the stroke-affected limb in their home and community settings to maintain the functional level learned in the clinic, but currently, there exists no effective, practical clinical tool.

"Comparative Safety of Seizure Prophylaxis within the Medicare Program PI Name(s): Moura, Lidia Maria Veras Rocha de   Project Title: Comparative Safety of Seizure Prophylaxis within the Medicare Program 1R01AG073410-01 Each year thousands of Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease and/or Alzheimer’s-related dementias (AD/ADRD) receive anticonvulsant drugs for seizure prophylaxis. These drugs are life-saving given the severity of seizure sequalae, but also life-threatening because of serious adverse events. Patients with AD/ADRD are particularly vulnerable given their high susceptibility to both stroke and adverse events. The decision to start and stop anticonvulsants also might change when the patient have AD/ADRD, in part because anticonvulsant therapy management becomes more complex when patients have difficulty with therapy having a narrow therapeutic range or difficulty recognizing early complication symptoms. There are no trial data to guide decisions about prophylaxis after an ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD. The sparse and conflicted existing literature has been limited by the difficulty assessing relevant measures, e.g., stroke severity or AD/ADRD status, in claims. Medicare claims offer potential, but lack well-validated definitions for stroke severity, AD/ADRD status, seizures, or adverse effects. We will address these issues using a novel dataset with individual-level linked longitudinal information from registries, electronic health records, and Medicare claims, and will develop prediction models for key baseline and outcome variables. Then, using a random 20% sample of national traditional, fee-for-service Medicare claims over 18 years (2006-23), we will emulate clinical trials assessing two critical decisions in the setting of first mild to moderate ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD: a) initiating outpatient prophylaxis versus not; and b) stopping prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. We will apply multiple analytical tools to address confounding and other challenges. We will stratify our population based on AD/ADRD status because the patterns of strokes, post-stroke seizures, and treatment complications differ among patients with compared to those without AD/ADRD, as could the clinical management patterns. We have three aims: 1) To validate claims-based prediction models for our study variables; 2) To emulate a clinical trial comparing outpatient prophylaxis initiation versus not; and 3) To emulate a clinical trial comparing stopping outpatient prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. This comparative safety study could inform future policy and clinical care and improve stroke and AD/ADRD care, e.g., through adjustments in Medicare quality incentives and clinical guidelines. Moreover, these data could help inform patients, families, clinicians, and policy makers about how we can improve care for patients who could require seizure prophylaxis. NARRATIVE Anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed to older adults after stroke to prevent seizures, but these drugs may not be necessary or the harms could outweigh the benefits. There is limited rigorous evidence guiding when and how physicians should prescribe this type of treatment. This project will use the real-world experience of millions of Medicare beneficiaries to generate this evidence and inform both policy and future clinical decisions.",Comparative Safety of Seizure

"Precision blood pressure management after endovascular stroke therapy based on real-time autoregulation measurements Abstract The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Nils Petersen, a Neurocritical Care and Stroke Neurologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital, and Assistant Professor at Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Petersen is a physician- scientist with specialized knowledge of human cerebral hemodynamics who is investigating personalized, autoregulation-guided blood pressure management after ischemic stroke. About 40% of patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion (LVO) are rendered non-ambulatory, bedridden or deceased despite treatment with endovascular thrombectomy. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation in the acute phase of LVO stroke increase the risk of secondary brain injury from relative cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion. Thus, autoregulation-guided, personalized blood pressure management presents a promising alternative to the current practice of targeting fixed thresholds. By providing a more favorable physiologic environment for the injured brain, the autoregulation-guided approach may reduce secondary brain injury and improve outcomes. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Petersen have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan that uses near- infrared spectroscopy and real-time data processing to identify a patient-specific blood pressure range that yields optimal brain blood flow. This research proposal will evaluate if blood pressure management outside personalized limits of autoregulation increases the risk for neurologic worsening from infarct progression or hemorrhagic transformation, leading to increased rates of unfavorable outcome (Aim 1). Next, Dr. Petersen will evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic blood pressure interventions and explore the feasibility of an intervention protocol targeting a personalized blood pressure range (Aim 2). Under the expert mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth, Chief of Neurocritical Care, Dr. Randolph Marshall, Director of Stroke Division at Columbia University, and Dr. Cynthia Brandt, Director of Medical Informatics, this K23 award will allow Dr. Petersen 1) to acquire skills in informatics, advanced signal processing and machine learning in order to enhance current methods of quantifying cerebral autoregulation, 2) to develop expertise in clinical trial design, 3) to build a research group dedicated to discovery and clinical evaluation of physiology-based individualized treatment strategies after stroke, and 4) to foster inter-institutional collaboration and data-sharing. This proposal will leverage Yale’s cutting-edge neuro-monitoring technologies along with extensive informatics and research resources from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation to generate new insights into cerebral hemodynamics and identify treatment opportunities. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Petersen will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in the area of cerebral hemodynamics. His long-term goal is to use neuro-monitoring to develop physiology-based, personalized, early interventions to reduce the disability and morbidity associated with stroke. Narrative Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and this research proposal addresses the NIH mission to reduce the burden of neurological disorders and enhance the quality of life of people with disability. Current stroke treatments are primarily aimed at treating blockage of blood vessels but are only partially effective, leaving a great need for additional adjunctive therapies. Effective blood pressure management tailored to individual patients, with the aim of maintaining optimal brain blood flow, may prevent additional brain injury, and is an important first-step towards

"Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and the most common stroke-related impairment is upper-limb hemiparesis, affecting 80% of stroke patients acutely and 40% chronically. Full recovery is unlikely with current rehabilitation approaches, and as a result, stroke reduces quality of life, increases healthcare costs, and burdens caregivers. The long-term goal of this project is to leverage assistive bionic devices to restore motor function and promote long-term neuro-regeneration, ultimately replacing more expensive and less effective rehabilitation approaches with a patient-centered rehabilitation strategy. The objective of this proposal is to control assistive bionic exoskeletons and quantify stroke recovery with electromyographic (EMG) recordings of residual muscle activity from the paretic arm. Our central hypothesis is that an EMG-controlled powered orthosis – that assists individuals in activities of daily living – can be used as a patient-specific rehabilitative tool that improves stroke recovery. Aim 1 will adapt dexterous EMG-control algorithms for upper-limb orthoses, and then demonstrate improved hand dexterity and functional mobility for stroke patients. Aim 2 will utilize large EMG datasets over time to precisely quantify changes in muscle strength and spasticity throughout recovery and to provide robust long-term control of assistive devices via deep learning. Aim 3 consists of a pilot study to determine the feasibility of patient-specific assistive-device-driven rehabilitation. The proposed research is innovative because it will address gaps in knowledge critical to merging assistive and rehabilitative devices. These findings are significant because they will enable devices that can immediately and simultaneously promote usage, strengthen muscles, and provide closed-loop visual feedback – thereby merging multiple effective rehabilitation strategies into a single holistic approach. This proposal will have a positive impact on society by increasing rehabilitation compliance, promoting independence and improving recovery outcomes for stroke patients, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving patients’ quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This project aims to bridge the gap between assistive devices and rehabilitative tools so that stroke patients with a paretic arm can immediately return to their daily routine and use their activities of daily living as a patient-specific rehabilitation strategy. Assistive bionic exoskeletons will be intuitively controlled with residual muscle activity from the paretic arm, and artificial intelligence will elucidate underlying muscle impairment, improve the dexterity of bionic devices, and temporarily assist and rehabilitate stroke patients. This proposal is relevant to NIH’s mission because it has strong potential to improve quality of life for stroke patients and their caregivers, as well as reduce overall healthcare costs.",Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography,10260456,DP5OD029571,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Bionics ', ' Electromyography ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hand ', ' Hospitals ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Muscle Spasticity ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Regeneration ', ' Neuro-regeneration ', ' Neuronal regeneration ', ' Neuroregeneration ', ' nervous system regeneration ', ' neural regeneration ', ' neuroregenerative ', ' regenerated nerve ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Orthotic Devices ', ' Orthosis ', ' orthotics ', ' Paresis ', ' Muscle Paresis ', ' Muscular Paresis ', ' paretic ', ' paretic muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Medicine ', ' Physiatrics ', ' Physiatry ', ' Rehabilitation Medicine ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Rehabilitation Centers ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Running ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Societies ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' muscle strength ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' handbook ', ' exoskeletal ', ' exoskeleton ', ' visual feedback ', ' professor ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Agreement ', ' graduate student ', ' holistic approach ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' lecturer ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' BCL2-Interacting Protein ', ' DP5 ', ' Harakiri ', ' HRK gene ', ' Address ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' Motor ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Rehabilitation device ', ' rehab device ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' upper limb hemiparesis ', ' hemiparetic stroke ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' Secure ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' dexterity ', ' data visualization ', ' arm paresis ', ' paretic arm ', ' faculty mentor ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,DP5,2021,327385,UT-02
