"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional

"Transfer Learning for Digital Curation of the EMR Clinical Narrative Project Summary This proposal is in response to PAR 18-796 to seek support for advancing methodologies for a transfer learning framework for the digital curation of the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative. In the current era of increasing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biomedicine, our proposal tackles a critical AI component – automated annotation of health-related text. Since 2015 the development and application of machine learning (ML) methods has exploded propelled by the convergence of plentiful digitized unstructured data (text, speech, images), hardware and the refinement of neural networks or deep learning. 2018 marked a turning point in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transfer learning through pre-trained models like Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification, Allen AI's ELMO, OpenAI's Open-GPT. In November 2018, Google published the Bidirectional Encodings Representations from Transformers (BERT), a transformer-based model pre-trained on massive general text databases (3.3B words total). The publication reported using BERT representations to build classifiers for 11 NLP tasks which outperformed the state-of-the- art (SOTA) with large margins. The NLP research community jumped to the idea of exploring this new framework but quickly came to the realization that building BERT-style models from scratch is affordable and feasible to only a few. Thus, research investigation proceeded in the direction of using these gigantic models as resources for language representations. Scientific efforts focused on pre-trained models (e.g. BERT) as a source of extracting high quality language features or fine-tuning on a specific task, i.e. using a model as a checkpoint and re-training with much smaller amounts of task-specific data to produce predictions by typically adding one fully-connected layer on top of the representations and training for a few epochs. This general watershed shift in NLP to transfer learning which parallels the developments in computer vision a few years ago coupled with our latest work brings to the forefront a critical NLP research topic ripe for exploration – a transfer learning framework for the digital curation of the EMR clinical narrative. The proposed work is research of novel scientific methods for extracting detailed information from health-related text especially the EMR, the major source of phenotype data for patients. Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on responsiveness. This research is in line with the latest developments in neural deep learning approaches and AI in general and is expected to enhance biomedical research and through that the health of the public. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose research on transfer learning methods for the digital curation of a key biomedical asset – the clinical narrative as part of the Electronic Medical Record.

"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,10111556,K01HL145345,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Procedures ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Titrations ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Failure ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Provider ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' cost ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' hypertension control ', ' hypertension management ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' data warehouse ', ' blood pressure medication ', ' blood pressure medicine ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' provider adherence ', ' adherence by clinicians ', ' adherence by providers ', ' clinician adherence ', ' clinician compliance ', ' physician adherence ', ' physician compliance ', ' provider compliance ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' ']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2021,121124,TN-05
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",10102260,R01HD087363,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' wasting ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' Organ failure ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' data registry ', ' Emergent care ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' support tools ', ' electronic registry ', ' pediatric emergency ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' Pediatric cohort ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' ']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,597143,IL-07
"LIVOPT -- LIVer cirrhosis - Optimizing Prediction of Patient OuTcomes PROJECT ABSTRACT Cirrhosis is a leading cause of mortality in the United States (US), diagnosed in millions of people and resulting in over 40,000 deaths each year, predominately in older people. These patients are at higher risk of serious complications (e.g. infection, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy), hospitalization and death. Little is known about the epidemiology and disease progression and older patients are more vulnerable and might have different risk profiles. The clinical challenge is to accurately and early predict who is at highest risk for requiring hospitalization and/or death and understanding how this might be different in older versus younger adults. . One barrier to date has been the lack of an epidemiologically representative patient sample that captures those with cirrhosis and goes beyond one health system, as many data repositories are skewed or limited: CMS only captures elderly and those with debility, NIS does not allow longitudinal observation, UNOS represents less than one percent of those with cirrhosis. Hence, we will build on our previous work to use a unique dataset, the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN). CAPriCORN captures the electronic health records (EHR) from nine health systems from 2011-present (incl. academic center, county, VA and private), catching most of the diverse patient population in the greater Chicago metropolitan area, namely ~160,000 patients with liver cirrhosis. The dataset is extensive, allowing the use of traditional (e.g., regression) and novel analytical techniques (e.g. deep learning) to pursue the aims of the study. We aim to model cirrhosis progression in the elderly and to predict the risk of hospitalization and death in older patients with cirrhosis. We also aim to perform sub-group analyses focusing on race and socioeconomic factors in the elderly. The impact of accurate and early prediction of mortality and hospitalization risk in elderly patients with cirrhosis allows for targeted interventions of the most vulnerable patients to improve outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because liver cirrhosis affects a large segment of the elderly population with high mortality and high risk for decompensation requiring resource-intensive care, yet little knowledge exists about disease progression and risk prediction. We use a large population based dataset, Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN), which captures the electronic health records (EHR) from nine health systems from 2011-present (incl. academic center, county, VA and private), catching most of the diverse patient population in a large metropolitan area, namely ~160,000 patients with liver cirrhosis.

"PheMAP: Measured, Automated Profile to Facilitate High Throughput Phenotyping Electronic health records (EHRs) are a powerful and efficient tool for biological discovery globally. However, a vital step for EHR-based research is valid, accurate, and reliable phenotyping (i.e., correctly identifying individuals with a particular trait of interest). Conventional approaches to phenotyping are ad hoc, domain expert dependent, rule-based, and usually specific to EHR environments. However, each requires an extensive investment of time and resources to develop due to the heterogeneity, complexity, inaccuracy, and frequent fragmentation of EHRs. The lack of general, automatic, and portable approaches to enable accurate high- throughput phenotyping is a critical barrier that hampers our ability to leverage valuable clinical data in EHRs for better healthcare. We propose a new generalizable high-throughput approach: Phenotyping by Measured, Automated Profile (PheMAP) that we have developed from public resources and will further refine and implement across various EHRs. We recognize that mass information about phenotypes is often described in significant detail and continuedly accumulated within publicly available resources (e.g., MedlinePlus and Wikipedia). We hypothesize this information can be retrieved, filtered, organized, measured, and formalized into standard EHR phenotype profiles. Indeed, we have used such an ensemble approach to integrate four generalizable online medication resources (e.g., SIDER and RxNorm) to create MEDI--a resource linking 2,136 medications and 13,304 indications. In preliminary studies, we extended this strategy to phenotyping and created a prototype PheMAP. For each phenotype, we identified relevant clinical concepts and weighted each based on its importance to the phenotype. We then mapped all associated concepts to commonly-used clinical terminologies. Our preliminary studies showed an average consistency of 98.6%±0.8% between our early-stage PheMAP and three validated eMERGE algorithms (Type 2 Diabetes, dementia, and hypothyroidism). We seek support to refine and optimize PheMAP and develop tools to allow researchers to implement PheMAP efficiently in different EHRs. This will allow researchers to rapidly and accurately determine the status of thousands of phenotypes for millions of individuals with minimal human intervention. Since PheMAP is created using independent resources that are more generalizable than a local clinical dataset, the implementation will generate more consistent outcomes in different EHRs for large-scale analyses.The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to conduct high-throughput genome-wide and phenome-wide association analyses (GWASs and PheWASs). We will use data from multiple biobanks to accomplish these tasks. Specifically, we will achieve the following goals in this grant: 1.refine PheMAP and conduct large-scale validation, 2. implement PheMAP and perform representative GWASs and PheWASs, 3. Use PheMAP to conduct GWASs for unstudied or understudied diseases and phenotypes, and 4. Share PheMAP to facilitate research using EHRs. Electronic health records (EHRs) are a powerful and efficient tool for biological discovery globally while a vital step for EHR-based research is valid, accurate, and reliable phenotyping. Conventional approaches to phenotyping are ad hoc, domain expert dependent, rule-based, and usually specific to EHR environments. We propose to refine, validate, and share a new generalizable high-throughput approach: Phenotyping by Measured, Automated Profile (PheMAP) that allows researchers to rapidly and accurately determine the status of thousands of phenotypes for millions of individuals with minimal human intervention.","PheMAP: Measured, Automated Profile to Facilitate High Throughput Phenotyping",10095131,R01GM139891,"['Algorithms ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Sensorineural Hearing Loss ', ' Sensorineural Deafness ', ' Sensory Hearing Loss ', ' sensorineural hearing impairment ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothyroidism ', ' Investments ', ' Maps ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Terminology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' MedlinePlus ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' Outcome ', ' Heritability ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' prototype ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biomedical ontology ', ' phenome ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network ', ' eMERGE Consortium ', ' eMERGE Network ', ' off-label drug ', ' off-label medication ', ' off-label use ', ' off-label application ', ' off-label prescribing ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' implementation tool ', ' ']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,432500,TN-05
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10136739,R44TR003254,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Belief ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Language ', ' language training ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patients ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Licensing ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' System ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' rapid growth ', ' next generation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' commercialization ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' cloud based ', ' model building ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Natural Language Processing pipeline ', ' NLP pipeline ', ' clinical database ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' ']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2021,496453,TX-09
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging

"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,10085674,R01LM012973,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Boston ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Israel ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Records ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' data resource ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network ', ' machine translation ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,366696,MA-07
"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,10202727,R01HS026246,[''],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,396733,MA-07
"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

"A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In radiology practices, timely and accurate formulation of reports is closely linked to patient satisfaction, physician productivity, and reimbursement. While the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Soci- ety of North America have recommended implementation of structured reporting to facilitate clear and consistent communication between radiologists and referring clinicians, cumbersome nature of current structured reporting systems made them unpopular amongst their users. Recently, the emerging techniques of deep learning have been widely and successfully applied in many different natural language processing tasks (NLP). However, when adopted in a certain speciﬁc domain, such as radiology, these techniques should be combined with extensive domain knowledge to improve efﬁciency and accuracy. There is, therefore, a critical need to take advantage of clinical NLP and deep learning to fundamentally change the radiology reporting. The long-term goal in this appli- cation is to improve the form, content, and quality of radiology reports and to facilitate rapid generation of radiol- ogy reports with consistent organization and standardized texts. The overall objective is to use radiology-speciﬁc ontology, NLP and computer vision techniques, and deep learning to construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph, which will then be used to build a reporting system that can assist radiologists to quickly generate struc- tured and standardized text reports. The rationale for this project is that through integration of new clinical NLP technologies, radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graphs, and development of new reporting system, we can build au- tomatous systems with a higher-level understanding of the radiological world. The speciﬁc aims of this project are to: (1) recognize and normalize named entities in radiology reports; (2) construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph from free-text and images; and (3) build a reporting system that can dynamically adjust templates based on radiologists' prior entries. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it combines deep learning, NLP techniques, and domain knowledge in a single framework to construct comprehensive and accurate knowledge graphs that will enhance the workﬂow of the current reporting systems. The proposed research is signiﬁcant because a novel reporting system can expedite radiologists' workﬂow and acquire well-annotated datasets that facilitate machine learning and data science. To develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Yifan Peng, requires additional training and mentoring in clinical NLP and radiology. During the K99 phase, Dr. Peng will conduct this research as a research fellow at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. He will be mentored by Dr. Zhiyong Lu, a leading text mining and deep learning researcher, and co- mentored by Dr. Ronald M. Summers, a leading radiologist and clinical informatics researcher. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Peng to achieve the career goals of becoming an independent investigator and leader in the study of clinical NLP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it entails a new strategy to construct a radiology- speciﬁc knowledge graph to facilitate the development of a new reporting system that enables rapid generation of structured radiology reports. The proposed knowledge graph and reporting system will contribute to advancement in understanding of the radiological world, and promise to enhance clinical communication and patient-centric care. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission that pertains to applying deep knowledge of clinical terminology and natural language processing to improve clinical data science and health services.",A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications,10224953,R00LM013001,"['Award ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' North America ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resort ', ' Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Development Plans ', ' radiologist ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' impression ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Nomenclature ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' American College of Radiology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Ontology ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' lexical ', ' Systems Development ', ' Data Science ', ' Formulation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' long short term memory ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' ']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R00,2021,236549,NY-12
"EHR-based vs population-based CVD risk predictions for older patients with diabetes Our application entitled “Fair Risk Predictions for Underrepresented Populations using Electronic Health Records” responds to NOT-OD-21-094: “Administrative Supplements to Support Collaborations to Improve the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning [AI/ML]-Readiness of NIH-Supported Data”, and supplements our parent NIA R01 grant (R01 AG065330) entitled “EHR-based vs population-based CVD risk predictions for older patients with diabetes”. The overarching goal of the parent grant is to develop individualized absolute risk predictions of Cardiovascular diseases for older patients with diabetes using EHRs. We propose the supplement study, in parallel, to 1) investigate under-representations (bias) of racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged Social Determinants of Health (SDOHs) in EHRs, 2) develop fairness-aware EHR prediction methods; and 3) share the simulated EHR datasets, linked SDOH datasets along with the developed fair risk prediction tools to inspire and enable the AI/ML research community for further investigations of fair EHR algorithms. During the implementation of our parent R01 project, we found emerging evidence of under- sampling bias in EHRs for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged SDOHs. Such patients are more likely to visit multiple institutions to receive care, and often receive fewer diagnostic tests and medications in the EHR data of a single institution. We hypothesize that racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged SDOHs are under-represented with smaller sample sizes, insufficient diagnostics and laboratory information, and less frequent encounters in EHRs. Consequently, we hypothesize that EHR-based risk prediction models (including conventional linear models and modern AI/ML methods) ignoring the unbalanced samplings will have less-accurate predictions for these under-represented patient populations. Little or no work has been done to systematically investigate the impact of these biases. We then propose to develop fairness improvement prediction approaches for EHRs. Upon the supplement project completion, the developed fair predictions will lay the groundwork and provide resources for the broader AI/ML research community for developing fair predictions to advance disease predictions and detections for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged SDOHs. Project Narrative In this administrative supplement proposal, our interdisciplinary team proposes to 1) investigate under- representations (bias) of racial/ethnic minorities and patients with disadvantaged Social Determinants of Health (SDOHs) in EHRs, 2) develop fairness-aware EHR prediction methods; and 3) share the simulated EHR datasets, linked SDOH datasets along with the developed fair risk prediction tools to inspire and enable the AI/ML research community for further investigations of fair EHR algorithms.",EHR-based vs population-based CVD risk predictions for older patients with diabetes,10412553,R01AG065330,"['Algorithms ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Censuses ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' prescription procedure ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' open source ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' demographics ', ' parent grant ', ' parent project ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' social health determinants ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' learning community ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' risk prediction model ', ' social vulnerability ', ' social disadvantage ', ' social determinants ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,320767,NY-12
"Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks Project Summary/Abstract Patient care has been transformed by the availability of high-dimensional sources like electronic health records (EHR) and genomic data, allowing health care decisions to be tailored to individual patients. Statistical methods have been developed to efﬁciently use such high dimensional data, but critical gaps still remain. Several common models for survival analysis have recently been extended to accommodate high-dimensional variable selection and machine learning prediction methods, but similar tools have not yet been developed for the setting of semi- competing risks. In the semi-competing risks setting, interest focuses on jointly modeling both a terminal time- to-event outcome, as well as a non-terminal time-to-event outcome which can only occur for subjects who have not yet experienced the terminal event. Examples of this exist in severe pregnancy-related diseases such as pre-eclampsia (PE - further described below). PE and subsequent delivery are natural semi-competing risks, as PE can develop before delivery, but not after. Current methods do not provide analysts with data-driven tools for uncovering important covariates from high-dimensional data, and clinicians lack meaningful, personalized predictions of patients' joint probability of experiencing one or both outcomes prospectively through time.  This proposal addresses these methodological gaps with tools for high-dimensional inference and prediction. In Aim 1, I will address the challenge of variable selection by developing a suite of regularized estimators for se- lecting important covariates from large datasets into a semi-competing risks model, and evaluating performance by simulation. In Aim 2, I will create a deep feed forward neural network modeling framework for predicting individual patients' joint probabilities of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest across future time points. Together, these aims will improve personalization of health care decisions. Software will be developed that provides researchers practical and user-friendly tools for applying these methods. In Aim 3, I will apply these approaches for semi-competing risks to evaluate risk of PE, which is globally a leading cause of maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality and morbidity. Using EHR pregnancy data from 50,000 births between 2011-2020, I will use the proposed variable selection methods to develop a model identifying risk factors for PE along with factors affecting time-to-delivery among PE patients. Through this work, I will also build a deep learning model in order to jointly predict maternal PE and NICU admission of the infant, yielding personalized prediction plots to facilitate care decisions that balance maternal and fetal health risks. For ease of use by clinicians and patients, I will disseminate this prediction model using an interactive online tool. Project Narrative  Using personalized risk prediction to help clinicians and patients make health care decisions is a vital and rapidly growing way to improve outcomes and quality of care. However, in the common survival analysis setting known as semi-competing risks where both a non-terminal event and a terminal event are of interest, there lack adequate methods for modeling patients' joint risks using high-dimensional data sources such as electronic health records. The focus of this proposal is the development of statistical and machine-learning methods for this setting to predict individual patients' prospective joint risk over time of experiencing one or both outcomes of interest, and apply them to risk stratiﬁcation and individualized prediction of outcomes for preeclampsia in pregnant women.",Methods for High-Dimensional Statistical Inference and Individualized Risk Prediction under Semi-Competing Risks,10249946,F31HD102159,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Israel ', ' Joints ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' newborn death ', ' newborn mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Probability ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Lasso ', ' Caring ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' neonatal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' user-friendly ', ' unborn child ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' tailored health care ', ' tailored healthcare ', ' interactive tool ', ' individual patient ', ' personalized health care ', ' personalized healthcare ', ' precision health care ', ' precision healthcare ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' high dimensionality ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' Fetal health ', ' feedforward neural network ', ' feed forward neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' neonatal health ', ' newborn health ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2021,34886,MA-07
"Increasing Interoperability of Brain Morphometrics Using FHIR PROJECT SUMMARY With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in medicine, radiologists have new tools at their disposal to quantitatively assess imaging data. However, in order to unlock this potential, data needs to be shared easily and effectively between all parts of the health information technology (IT) system. The goal of this project is to reduce data access barriers by developing software to cleanly integrate medical imaging data stored in a radiology department’s picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) with the rest of patients’ electronic health record (EHR) using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard. CorticoMetrics will use our THINQ™ software as a medical device (SaMD) product to provide brain morphometrics derived from MR imaging data, and extend its functionality to output results in both Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine structured reporting (DICOM-SR) and Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) compliant formats. Based off of the scientifically validated FreeSurfer suite of automated neuroimaging analysis software, THINQ provides measurements of brain structures that can aid in the care of neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Output in FHIR and DICOM-SR formats will be validated and included in CorticoMetrics’ next FDA 510(k) submission of THINQ. Incorporating this information with the rest of the rest of a patient’s EHR will enable a seamless workflow for clinicians to make decisions more efficiently and accurately while also improving the performance of those with less experience. This project will develop and disseminate an open source software tool to interconvert neuroimaging data between formats used in academic settings (such as FreeSurfer’s MGH or Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI)) with the standard formats used in health care settings (DICOM and FHIR). Common Data Elements (CDE) will be used to facilitate data sharing across studies where appropriate. The product will lead to an increase in interoperability of brain morphometrics, giving medical professionals access to key data directly in the EHR. While THINQ will serve as an initial use case of this technology, the conversion tool will be easily extensible to other use cases, and freely available to developers of the next generation of quantitative imaging software. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will develop software using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard to integrate quantitative assessment of brain MRI data from CorticoMetrics’ THINQ™ software as a medical device (SaMD) product into existing clinical workflows. FHIR application programming interfaces (APIs) enable seamless connection of medical imaging data and metadata stored in a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) with the rest of patients’ electronic health record (EHR), giving radiologists more information for earlier and more accurate assessment of changes in brain structure that occur in many neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. The resulting efforts will lead to the standalone release of open source tools, enhancing the ability to share data within and between health information systems and leading to improved quality of care and reduction in radiology report turnaround time.",Increasing Interoperability of Brain Morphometrics Using FHIR,10255591,R43EB030910,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hydrocephalus ', ' Hydrocephaly ', ' hydrocephalic ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Rest ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' radiologist ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Health Information System ', ' Reporting ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Update ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' health information technology ', ' data sharing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' health data ', ' imaging software ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' data access ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' DICOM ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' Data Store ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIBIB,"CORTICOMETRICS, LLC",R43,2021,149500,MA-06
"Developing an Unbiased Machine Learning Tool for Prediction of Acute Coronary Syndrome Abstract Significance: Racial and sex disparities in the diagnosis and care of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients are well documented. As machine learning algorithms (MLA) become more common in healthcare settings, it is imperative to ensure that these methods do not contribute to disparities through biased predictions or differential accuracy across racial and sex groups. Research Question: Can a MLA be trained to be more accurate and less biased than commonly used risk stratification systems for ACS prediction? Prior Work: The research team developed a preliminary gradient boosted tree model for myocardial infarction (MI) prediction using retrospective data from electronic health records. On a hold-out test set, the algorithm classifier attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value of 0.92 when tested for the detection of MI at any point during a patient’s hospital stay. Other prior work by the research team involved development of a MLA to minimize bias in inpatient mortality predictions between White and non-White patient groups. The model was found to be unbiased as measured by the equal opportunity difference (EOD = 0.016, p = 0.204) and outperformed commonly used severity scoring systems MEWS, SAPS-II, and APACHE in respect to bias and accuracy. Specific Aims: In Aim 1, an unbiased model for early ACS prediction will be developed. Preprocessing the MLA training data will remove aspects of the data that reflect systemic health inequities while maintaining the aspects of the data that reflect relevant patient measurements and outcomes. Assessment of equal opportunity difference (EOD) and the Zemel statistic will provide a means to evaluate the MLA’s ability to operate without sex or racial bias. In Aim 2, the model’s performance will be compared to three commonly used ACS risk stratification scores. Evaluating model performance and bias against these systems will allow for comparison of the unbiased MLA to the current ACS standard of care. Methods: Aim 1: An ACS prediction algorithm that will be demonstrated to be unbiased when comparing performance accuracy on White vs. non-White and male vs. female emergency department patients will be developed. The model’s performance will be assessed with regard to the EOD and Zemel statistic, which measure the difference in false negative results and average predicted risk, respectively, between White and non-White and male and female patients under the null hypothesis of no difference. Aim 2: Model performance will be compared to modified versions of three other commonly used ACS risk stratification scores: the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score; the Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin (eptifibatide) Therapy (PURSUIT) score; and the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, some of which have been shown to perform differentially across gender and race. EOD and the Zemel statistic will also be assessed as a measure of bias for the MLA, GRACE, PURSUIT and TIMI scores. Future Directions: The MLA will be implemented in live hospital settings for prospective evaluation. Narrative Race- and sex-related differences in the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are well documented and can influence patient outcomes. Conventional risk stratification scoring systems used to guide resource allocation and treatment decisions may reflect racial and sex bias in their design and, in some cases, in their implementation. In response to the need for unbiased ACS clinical decision support tools, it is proposed herein to use machine learning to develop and validate an unbiased ACS prediction tool on the basis of electronic health record data to promote accurate and equitable recognition of ACS.",Developing an Unbiased Machine Learning Tool for Prediction of Acute Coronary Syndrome,10258045,R43MD016363,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Unstable angina ', ' Angina at Rest ', ' Preinfarction Angina ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' California ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex ', ' GP IIb IIIa complex ', ' GPIIb-IIIa Receptors ', ' Glycoproteins IIb-IIIa ', ' Integrin alpha-IIb beta-3 ', ' Integrin alphaIIbbeta3 ', ' glycoprotein IIb IIIa receptor ', ' Future ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Platelet Glycoproteins ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' eptifibatide ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' thrombolysis ', ' age group ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' trait ', ' resource guides ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' RA70 ', ' SAPS ', ' SCAP2 ', ' SKAP-HOM ', ' SKAP55R ', ' SCAP2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Mind Research ', ' Mind/Body Research ', ' mind-body research ', ' mind/body method ', ' Mind-Body Method ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Scheme ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical practice ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Acute Coronary Event ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' support tools ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive tools ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' clinical decision support ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' classifier algorithm ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' algorithm development ', ' acute care ', ' algorithm training ', ' live stream ', ' livestream ', ' ']",NIMHD,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2021,256585,CA-15
"Opening The Black Box:  Enhancing Machine Learning Interpretability To Optimize Clinical Response To Sudden Deterioration In COVID-19 Patients Project Summary/Abstract Advanced machine learning (ML) has consistently been shown to outperform expert opinion and more simple analytics for predicting clinical outcomes. However, there has been a paucity of successful prospective clinical implementations of such tools. The unique barriers to advanced ML implementation and adoption in healthcare are (1) the technological challenges of running and displaying these models in real-time within existing workflows and (2) a general distrust for black box algorithms among highly skilled providers. As a result, the promise of these tools is largely lost in healthcare. This is particularly problematic in COVID-19, where patients can deteriorate rapidly, from appearing stable to suddenly being in respiratory failure or shock with little obvious warning. Early recognition of this deterioration is vital to proactive interventions, which can improve outcomes. eCART is a predictive analytic that has been developed iteratively at the University of Chicago over the past decade to identify hospitalized patients at risk for acute clinical deterioration. A simple (logistic regression based) ML model (eCARTv2) is commercially available within electronic health records on AgileMD’s clinical decision support platform. eCARTv2 was developed in a retrospective multicenter dataset and its use in clinical practice was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction in mortality in a multicenter trial. Our team recently completed development and validation of a gradient boosted machine (GBM) version of the model (eCARTv4), using nearly 100 variables, including trends and interactions. The advanced ML model was significantly more accurate than the simple ML and other models for predicting acute clinical deterioration across all hospital settings, in both septic and non-septic patients as well as in COVID-19 patients. The next challenge is clinically implementing it. The goals of this project are to a) upgrade the existing AgileMD platform to support the previously derived and validated eCARTv4 model and overhaul the human-machine interface for an advanced user experience (UX) that provides, for the first time, interpretable, graphical insight into the contribution of individual variables to a real-time EHR-embedded advanced ML analytic, and b) measure the impact of the new tool on HCP effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. We hypothesize that the combination of high accuracy and interpretability afforded by the advanced ML and UX will result in earlier recognition of acute deterioration as well as increased System Usability Scores (SUS) and usefulness scores in the treatment of deteriorating COVID-19 patients over standard care. Project Narrative Advanced machine learning (ML) has the potential to improve patient outcomes by alerting health care providers to early signs of patient deterioration they may otherwise miss. However, clinical teams have been hesitant to fully embrace these tools because of their black box nature and inability to verify the logic underpinning them. This project intends to give medical staff the transparency they need to confidently leverage sophisticated ML tools to better treat hospitalized patients, particularly those with COVID-19.",Opening The Black Box:  Enhancing Machine Learning Interpretability To Optimize Clinical Response To Sudden Deterioration In COVID-19 Patients,10259197,R44EB030955,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Chicago ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Logic ', ' Medical Staff ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' satisfaction ', ' Relative Risks ', ' uptake ', ' septic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' prospective ', ' usability ', ' standard of care ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' Visualization ', ' distrust ', ' COVID-19 patient ', ' COVID infected patient ', ' COVID patient ', ' COVID positive patient ', ' COVID-19 infected patient ', ' COVID-19 positive patient ', ' COVID19 patient ', ' COVID19 positive patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 infected patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 patient ', ' SARS-CoV-2 positive patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 infected patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 patient ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 positive patient ', ' coronavirus disease infected patient ', ' coronavirus disease patient ', ' coronavirus disease positive patient ', ' coronavirus patient ', ' patient infected with COVID ', ' patient infected with COVID-19 ', ' patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' patient infected with coronavirus disease ', ' patient infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' patient with COVID ', ' patient with COVID-19 ', ' patient with COVID19 ', ' patient with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' patient with coronavirus disease ', ' patient with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' patient with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patient ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patient ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patient ', ' ']",NIBIB,"AGILEMD, INC.",R44,2021,1995966,CA-12
"Using Clinical Treatment Data in a Machine Learning Approach for Sepsis Detection Abstract Significance: We propose to evaluate the performance of HindSight in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). HindSight is a novel encoding software designed to optimize alerts for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight identifies clinicians’ sepsis-related decisions in the electronic health records of former patients and then uses these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of true positive sepsis cases. In our retrospective work, we have shown that HindSight enables InSight to adapt to the idiosyncrasies of real-world clinical deployment by successfully reducing false and irrelevant alarms, without human supervision. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the retrospective success of HindSight can be successfully translated to live clinical environments. Research Question: To what extent can a machine-learning-based labeler, which has retrospectively learned to autonomously label sepsis cases according to a clinician-labeled sepsis gold standard, successfully reduce false alerts in a prospective RCT? Will this tool perform more successfully than a sepsis CDS tool that is not designed to autonomously reproduce clinician identification of sepsis? Prior Work: In our Phase I work, HindSight achieved an AUROC of 0.899, 0.831 and 0.877 for clinician sepsis evaluation, treatment, and onset, respectively. By using an online learning algorithm to incorporate HindSight-labeled data into the InSight predictor, we showed that the online-trained InSight can adapt to the HindSight-labeled data and outperform both baseline and periodically re-trained versions of InSight (p < 0.05). Specific Aims: To prospectively validate HindSight’s performance on real-time patient data streams in four diverse hospitals non-interventionally (Aim 1); and to evaluate the effect of the tool in a prospective, interventional RCT (Aim 2). Methods: HindSight will be evaluated in the background at four academic and community hospitals. Following any necessary algorithm optimization arising from live hospital validation, we will perform an RCT to evaluate reductions in false alerts from InSight trained on HindSight sepsis labels (experimental arm), compared to InSight trained on gold standard Sepsis-3 labels (control arm). The primary outcome measure of interest will be false alert reduction. Successful completion of Aim 1 will be demonstrated by a positive predictive value (PPV) in a live clinical setting for which the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval meets or exceeds the benchmark from prior retrospective studies. Meeting the retrospective PPV benchmark indicates that prospective CDS quality reflects retrospective CDS quality, and is sufficiently high to reduce alarm fatigue and improve clinical utility. Success of Aim 2 is contingent upon achieving a 15% relative reduction in false alerts when comparing between the two treatment arms (p < 0.05; Fisher’s Exact Test). Future Directions: The clinical validation of HindSight’s impact on reducing false alerts in a multi-center, cross-ward RCT will demonstrate that alerts match local clinical practice and will promote commercial expansion to new hospital systems. Narrative Machine learning is a powerful method for creating clinical decision support (CDS) tools, when training labels reflect the desired alert behavior. In our Phase I work for this project we developed HindSight, an encoding software designed to examine discharged patients’ electronic health records (EHR), identify clinicians’ sepsis treatment decisions and patient outcomes, and pass these labeled examples to an online algorithm for retraining of InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for real-time sepsis prediction. HindSight has been shown to improve the performance of InSight sepsis alerts in retrospective work, and in this project we propose to assess the clinical utility of HindSight through a multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) for sepsis alerts.",Using Clinical Treatment Data in a Machine Learning Approach for Sepsis Detection,10258043,R44AA030000,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Client ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inpatients ', ' Judgment ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' falls ', ' Charge Nurses ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' septic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' ward ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' prospective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' support tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' experimental arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' primary endpoint ', ' primary end point ', ' Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ', ' learning algorithm ', ' data streams ', ' ']",NIAAA,"DASCENA, INC.",R44,2021,1999554,CA-15
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life.

"Bridging the Gap between Genomics and Clinical Outcomes in CHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The NHLBI has invested extensively in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), recognizing that translating genomic discoveries into optimized management and therapeutic strategies for congenital heart disease (CHD) can only be achieved in the context of multi-center, collaborative research. Currently, the PCGC is lacking two fundamental capabilities that hinder its ability to define the genomic basis for CHD outcomes: (1) a robust mechanism for extracting pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across multiple institutions; and (2) a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that is capable of teasing apart the complex interplay between maternal factors, phenotypes, genotypes, gene functions and clinical outcomes. Here, we propose innovative solutions to these challenges, by assembling teams of content experts to leverage existing infrastructure to extract relevant outcomes directly from the EHR of participating PCGC Centers and by designing best-practice AI tools for outcomes research. Our principal goal is provide the vision, infrastructure and expertise to collaboratively empower CHD outcomes research, foster knowledge exchange, and train the next generation of genomic scientists. We propose to leverage existing data infrastructure to obtain Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical variables at scale by partnering with other research networks to create a PCGC Data Resource. Using this resource, we will create and deploy a platform of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based predictors for CHD outcomes research, with the goal of translating genomic discoveries into improved management and therapeutic strategies for CHD.

"Leveraging the electronic health record to characterize and optimize care delivery for children with cerebral palsy. Abstract/summary Leveraging the electronic health record to characterize and optimize care delivery for children  with cerebral palsy: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood, but it is highly  heterogeneous with respect to its severity, response to therapy, care needs, and impact on wellness  for the child and family. To optimize health and wellness throughout life and enable new research  avenues to be effectively tested, it is critical to develop a comprehensive clinical care and  biopsychosocial data model. Development of a comprehensive model would both accelerate and improve  understanding, care, and further research, including the identification of novel targets for  interventions. The overriding objective of this proposal is to develop a precision health model for CP-related phenotypes, health status, care activities, and psychosocial well-being that will individualize care. To accomplish this objective, we will automate the collection, cleaning, and integration of multi-dimensional, multi-domain and multi-cohort based ""big data"" extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), and combine this EHR data with prospectively  collected, high-resolution clinical, functional, environmental and psychosocial data. The focus of this proposal will be on children between ages 6 and 12 years. Preliminary work indicates that the medical center provides care for  approximately 1,800 patients with CP who are between the ages of 6 and 12 years and have at least  three years of EHR data. From this EHR cohort, we will prospectively recruit 200 children and their  families for detailed phenotyping. Recruitment will be stratified by Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) Levels: 60%  GMFCS I, II, or III (able to walk) and 40% GMFCS IV or V (use a wheelchair). Using this  multi-cohort design will allow for robust characterization of multi-dimensional factors that impact care receipt, functional  outcomes, quality of life and participation. Aim 1 will focus on creating a diverse and comprehensive data repository  using both retrospective and prospective data to characterize actual versus optimal care (defined  by current evidence-based literature). Aim 2 will lead to development of a receipt of care  coefficient score and characterize how the degree of optimal care relates to function, quality of  life and participation, controlling for functional status and age. [Models developed in Aim 2 will  be translated into a clinical decision tool prototype. Aim 3 will demonstrate proof of concept for  scalability of machine learning algorithms with the PEDSnet Learning Health System. This project  innovatively combines retrospective EHR data with prospective clinical data to elucidate  individual, treatment, family, and environmental factors associated with greater receipt of  evidence-based care and/or better outcomes. This project will move the field toward precision  medicine for CP and create a foundation for development of clinical dashboards to optimize practice.] Project Narrative The proposed project innovatively applies machine learning methods to retrospective electronic  health record and prospective clinical data to develop a precision health model for cerebral  palsy-related phenotypes, health status, care activities, and psychosocial well-being that will  individualize care.

"SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance  Two decades have lapsed since the seminal publications of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, cast a national spotlight on health-care safety and quality, yet US patient outcome indices continue to lag behind those in other industrialized countries. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated health-care providers adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to widespread EHR adoption, albeit primarily for billing purposes rather than research or quality improvement efforts. Thus EHR impact on health-care quality has tended to be in the domains of physician efficiency and guideline compliance. Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care selling, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over lime. Widespread adoption of EHRs in U.S. hospitals now allows determination of outcome quality indicators for all patients in a hospital for real-time feedback to nurses. Quality indicators are often only determined by piecing together other information to determine occurrence of an incident, e.g., exhuming information buried in nursing notes. The goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-lime Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. CARI NG will reflect algorithmic innovations to mine sequential patterns from multi-sourced, heterogeneous data including nursing narratives, yielding robust predictive models that are insensitive to uncertain labels and evolve with changes in health-care practices. CARING will represent EHR data using inter-connected tensors, capturing higher-order relations, temporal weighting, i.e., more recent data receives more weight, and incorporating domain expert feedback in development. Although CARING will be developed initially for the ten hospitals of our industry partner Emory Healthcare, its flexible refinement will enable adaptation at other health-care institutions. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now. Moreover, this system can be implemented into the health information infrastructure at an institutional level, integrating multi-scale and multi-level clinical, contextual, and organizational data surrounding each patient for real-time reporting and incorporation into predictive models. CARING supports the National Library of Medicine mission 1) by creating an innovative open source suite of tools for advancing patient safety; and 2) through educational efforts: training graduate students and fellows, and developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOG), ""Big Data Analytics for Nursing,"" covering topics at the confluence of computer science, nursing, and patient outcome quality indicators. CARING will improve nursing care quality and make direct, positive impacts on patients, their families, and caregivers.",SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance ,10221054,R01LM013323,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Decision Making ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Fees ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' National Medical Library ', ' Nurse Administrator ', ' Director of Nursing ', ' Nurse Executive ', ' Vice President for Nursing ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses Performance Evaluations ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Time ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Recovery ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' Clinical Pathways ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' American ', ' nursing care quality ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' graduate student ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Documentation ', ' patient safety ', ' Limes ', ' Institution ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Nursing Informatics ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Seminal ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' vector ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' patient population ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' massive open online courses ', ' massive open on-line courses ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' Infrastructure ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' learning algorithm ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' acute care ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' ']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,230564,GA-05
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advance care planning and palliative care represent evidence-based, high-quality care for patients with advanced cancer. Early identification of patients at risk of short-term mortality is a promising strategy to increase advance care planning and palliative care. However, this is limited by prognostic inaccuracy among oncology clinicians, who overestimate prognosis for 70% of their patients with advanced cancer. While recent advances in electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure and machine learning (ML) have allowed accurate identification of patient' mortality risk, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to integrate ML prognostic algorithms alongside clinician intuition (“human-machine collaborations”) in the routine care of patients with cancer. Dr. Parikh's research objective is to develop and test human-machine collaborative systems that leverage ML algorithms to improve clinicians' prognostic accuracy in order to prompt earlier advance care planning and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. In prior work, Dr. Parikh has prospectively validated and embedded into the EHR an automated ML algorithm to predict short-term mortality risk among patients with cancer. In this application, Dr. Parikh proposes to take a fundamental next step in this work by exploring strategies to improve prognostic accuracy and decision-making among oncologists treating patients with advanced cancer. In Aim 1, Dr. Parikh will retrain and validate the existing ML mortality risk prediction algorithm by integrating recently-available patient-generated health data. In Aim 2, Dr. develop prognostic that Parikh will a vignette-based survey to assess optimal strategies of presenting ML predictions to improve accuracy. He will administer this survey to a large national sample of medical oncologists to ensure clinician perspectives are incorporated into interventions.In Aim 3, Dr. Parikh will develop two models of human-machine collaborative systems to generate real-time mortality estimates that integrate clinician and algorithm predictions. In a pragmatic multi-institutional clinical trial among patients with advanced cancer, Dr. Parikh will test the impact of human-machine collaborations on prognostic accuracy and rates of advanced care planning and palliative care referral. These findings will have important implications for patients with cancer, their caregivers, oncology clinicians, and health systems. More broadly, the methods proposed may serve as a blueprint to develop and evaluate human-machine collaborations in oncology. This facilitate judgment highly-qualified Dr. development improving research will t raining in areas vital to Dr. Parikh's career goals: dvanced predictive modeling, survey methods and and decision-making, human-machine interfaces, and pragmatic clinical trials. Dr. Parikh has two and committed mentors: Dr. Justin Bekelman, an expert i n cancer care delivery r esearch, and Jinbo Chen, an expert in EHR-based predictive model development. The proposed research and career plan will enable Dr. Parikh to transition to an independent physician-scientist devoted to the quality and applicability of predictive analytics in the care of patients with cancer. a PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to improve prognostication for patients with advanced cancer by developing frameworks to integrate clinician intuition with machine learning algorithm- based mortality risk predictions (“human-machine collaborations”), a critical step to better identify patients who may benefit from earlier advance care planning and palliative care. This research proposal will optimize an existing machine learning mortality risk prediction algorithm and methodologically assess strategies to present machine learning estimates to clinicians in order to increase prognostic accuracy, advance care planning, and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. The project is relevant to the NCI's mission by generating fundamental knowledge to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about effective methods to improve and integrate predictive algorithms into clinical practice, thereby allowing better targeting of evidence-based interventions to improve quality of life for patients with advanced cancer.",Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer,10284721,K08CA263541,"['Algorithms ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rain ', ' rainfall ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Oncologist ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Medical Oncologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Dependence ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Early identification ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' cancer care ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' analytical tool ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical practice ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' health data ', ' prognostic tool ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' algorithm development ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,231174,PA-03
"Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular intervention"" Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular intervention Project Summary/Abstract Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects over 200 million people worldwide. Peripheral vascular interventions (PVI) are the most common procedures that are performed to manage PAD. Existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of patient outcomes after PVIs all had limited follow-up lengths due to difficulties in long-term data collections. In addition, heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) for stent placement vs. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone has not been well understood with the current approach of effect modifier assessment. Real-world data (RWD), particularly registries linked with electronic health data (EHR), are useful for studying long-term outcomes after vascular procedures. However, methods for working with multiple data sources and analyzing unstructured text data are still evolving. The proposed research aims to address current evidence gaps in long-term patient outcomes after PVI procedures. This will be facilitated by innovatively apply and refine data linkage, natural language processing (NLP), and effect modifier assessment methods. Specifically, this project will link registry and EHR data to 1) examine long-term major adverse limb events after stent placement vs. PTA alone as well as assess heterogeneity of treatment effect by patient characteristics; 2) develop an NLP pipeline with machine learning methods to analyze unstructured text data and examine long-term efficacy endpoints after stent placement vs. PTA alone, and; 3) establish feasibility and updating requirements for the deployment of the NLP tool for long-term PVI outcome assessment to other institutions. To support the research activities and the transition toward independence, the candidate will undertake the following career development activities during the award period: 1) gaining an in- depth understanding of NLP and machine learning methods; 2) refining data science expertise to integrate EHR into medical device epidemiologic research; 3) strengthening knowledge in current and novel vascular disease treatment; 4) developing and improving skills in grant writing and academic leadership; 5) training in responsible conduct of research. The candidate will be mentored by a team of experts with complementary strengths in surgical and device outcomes research, natural language processing and machine learning, and vascular disease and surgery. The proposed career development and research activities will develop the candidate's skillset and expertise and lead to an R01 level application. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an independent researcher focusing on the development and application of advanced multidisciplinary methods in the evaluation of surgical and device outcomes in the vascular disease area, supporting clinical, patient, and regulatory decision-making. Project narrative The proposed research will evaluate long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular interventions for peripheral arterial disease and assess heterogeneity of treatment effect. These will be supported by implementing and advancing data linkage, natural language processing, and effect modifier assessment methods for vascular research. The proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to foster fundamental knowledge generation and innovative research strategies that will ultimately help protect and improve health.","Leveraging linked registry and electronic health records to examine long-term patient outcomes after peripheral vascular intervention""",10283367,K01HL159315,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Balloon Angioplasty ', ' Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty ', ' Transluminal Angioplasty ', ' Transluminal Arterial Dilatation ', ' Award ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medical Device ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stents ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient registry ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' electronic structure ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' Natural Language Processing pipeline ', ' NLP pipeline ', ' multiple data sources ', ' unstructured data ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2021,162252,NY-12
"Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this K01 application is to give Dr. Hofer the necessary training and research experience to establish himself as an independent investigator focused on using machine learning (ML) on a variety of healthcare data to predict outcomes during the perioperative period. The career development activities consist of escalating coursework on machine learning beginning with an online course of ML fundamentals and ending with a UCLA course on ML applications in healthcare. Augmenting these courses are tutorials on the application of these techniques to healthcare data and a research program is designed to use ML on healthcare data to predict perioperative cardio-respiratory instability (CRI) – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia.  To achieve these goals, Dr. Hofer has established an outstanding team of leaders in machine learning, perioperative medicine, and clinical informatics. Dr. Maxime Cannesson, his primary mentor, is an expert in perioperative medicine and the use of ML on physiologic signals. Dr. Eran Halperin, the co-mentor for this pro- posal, is an expert in ML and its application to genomic and other healthcare data. Dr. Hofer has ongoing collab- orations with Drs. Cannesson and Halperin on joint projects. Both Drs. Cannesson and Halperin have a strong track record of mentoring individuals who have progressed to independent and productive academic careers. Dr. Hofer will be aided by an advisory committee consisting of Dr. Douglas Bell (who will provide guidance on integrating data from multiple sources), Dr. Mohammed Mahbouba (providing support regarding data security and creating enterprise level analytic solutions) and Dr. Jeanine Wiener-Kronish (providing guidance on the most relevant questions in perioperative outcome prediction).  Challenges managing CRI have been implicated in the more than 15 million annual postoperative com- plications, costing more than $165 billion, however no scores exist to predict CRI. This study will leverage unique infrastructure at UCLA where whole EMR data has been combined with physiologic waveforms and genomic data on more than 30,000 patients. This proposal will use a variety of ML techniques on these data to create predictive models for CRI.  In summary, this proposal will provide Dr. Hofer with both technical training in ML and hands on experi- ence in using ML to predict perioperative outcomes. This study has the potential to create models that will help clinicians predict, and thus avoid, perioperative instability, thereby improving patient outcomes. Additionally, this program will provide Dr. Hofer with the tools he needs to successfully compete for a R01 focusing on using ML models on a variety of healthcare data to predict the downstream effects of CRI – perioperative complications. Project Narrative During the perioperative period hemodynamic instability is the norm rather than the exception; the ability of clinicians to manage this instability has been associated with postoperative complications affecting more than 15 million Americans and costing more than $165 billion each year. There are no current risk scores that predict instability in real time, however the recent widespread adoption of electronic medical records and creation of genomic biobanks creates unique opportunities to develop scores that are both accurate and precise. We will use machine learning techniques to create risk scores for perioperative cardiorespiratory instability – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia – using combined electronic medical record, genomic and physiologic waveform data.","Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability",10247089,K01HL150318,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Atlases ', ' California ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Modernization ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' pressure ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' acute stress ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Process ', ' electronic data ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Perioperative complication ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' genetic information ', ' online course ', ' E-course ', ' online curriculum ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' Infrastructure ', ' random forest ', ' long short term memory ', ' multiple data sources ', ' structured data ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' prognostic model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2021,175284,CA-33
"Bio-digital Rapid Alert to Identify Neuromorbidity The silent development and progression of neurologic morbidity, or neuromorbidity, among hospitalized, critically ill patients represents a newly recognized and emerging epidemic. This includes patients admitted to intensive care units with primary neurologic diagnoses, those at increased risk based on their underlying disease (e.g. neurotropic viral infections including COVID19), and those where the development of neuromorbidity is occult and unexpected. Neuromorbidity associated with critical illness can be caused by physiologic instability, biochemical derangements, side effects of medications, invasive mechanical support, immobility, and/or other therapies used to prevent death. It spans the age spectrum from neonates to the elderly, occurs across gender and race, and is underrecognized in patients with systemic illnesses (e.g. sepsis, viral infections, and other inflammatory conditions) and critical organ failure (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome, cancer, hepatic and renal failure). In the U.S. the incidence of neuromorbidity ranges from 5-47% in critically ill children and adults, thus impacting hundreds of thousands of patients annually. Often neuromorbidity evolves undetected until after clinical manifestations emerge and is irreversible. Neuromorbidity can strike acutely, e.g. seizures, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and/or delirium, or in a more protracted fashion, e.g. neuromuscular weakness and/or cognitive decline, and is often permanent, endured throughout the remainder of a person’s lifetime. No standard clinical tool exists to identify patients at risk for neuromorbidity or for real-time neurologic monitoring, in stark contrast to the heart, kidney, liver, and many other organs.  To fill this gap and transform the way clinicians detect and monitor for evolving brain injury, we developed a Bio-digital Rapid Alert to Identify Neuromorbidity (BRAIN) that continuously feeds electronic health record (EHR) variables in 9 clinical domains (A through I) into proprietary informatics and machine learning platforms. Prototype BRAIN A-I models are robust and predict clinician concern for neuromorbidity before clinical action is taken. To link biological and digital signatures, we have defined a panel of serum biomarkers that can identify time-documented neuromorbidity before clinical detection. Using a “Bayesian to Bedside” approach, we have created a live data pipeline bridging the EHR and a dedicated host server, establishing the infrastructure necessary to operationalize BRAIN A-I as an embedded predictive analytic and decision-driving support tool.  In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that digital signatures in the EHR coupled with brain-specific biomarkers can rapidly detect neuromorbidity in critically ill children. Successful deployment of interoperable, 24/7 point-of-care neurologic monitoring for early detection of neuromorbidity would represent a breakthrough for the clinical management of critically ill patients. The silent development and progression of neurologic morbidity, or neuromorbidity, among hospitalized, critically ill patients represents a newly recognized and emerging epidemic. Despite this, no standard clinical tool exists to identify patients at risk for neuromorbidity or for real-time neurologic monitoring, in stark contrast to the heart, kidney, liver, and many other organs. To fill this gap and transform the way clinicians detect and monitor for evolving brain injury, we propose to validate and deploy a bio-digital process for 24/7 point-of-care neurologic monitoring for early detection of neuromorbidity in critically ill patients.",Bio-digital Rapid Alert to Identify Neuromorbidity,10313294,R01NS118716,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral Edema ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Consultations ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Heart ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Pediatric Intensive Care Units ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Gender ', ' Encephalopathies ', ' Liver Failure ', ' Hepatic Failure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Intracranial Hemorrhages ', ' Custom ', ' Critically ill children ', ' critically ill child ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Organ failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' neuromuscular ', ' vector ', ' neonate ', ' digital ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' interoperability ', ' neurotropic ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' support tools ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' Infrastructure ', ' side effect ', ' data pipeline ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' biomarker signature ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,651658,PA-18
"Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters PROJECT SUMMARY ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small vessel vasculitis associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to reduced quality of life and excess mortality compared to the general population. In the context of improving rates of flare and mortality with contemporary treatments, increasing attention is shifting to complications (e.g., renal failure, infection, cardiovascular disease) as clinically-relevant and patient-oriented outcomes. However, our understanding of how best to address and prevent complications is limited because they are typically studied in isolation from a “single disease framework.” We do not understand how complications tend to co-occur in individuals in complication clusters. Moreover, with several available treatment options for AAV, comparative effectiveness studies using real-world experience data and relevant outcomes like complication clusters are needed to guide treatment decisions in a manner that personalizes care, improves quality of life, and reduces mortality. However, we do not have the methods to accurately and efficiently assemble an AAV cohort using state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage heterogeneous claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. The aims of this proposal are to (1) apply advanced clinical informatics methods (i.e., machine learning and natural language processing) to identify AAV cases in big data to assemble a large cohort and (2) determine complication clusters in an AAV cohort by applying latent transition analysis. To achieve these aims, we will leverage methodologic expertise developed through collaborations established during the PI’s K23 and use a novel data source that includes EHR data linked to Medicare and Medicaid claims. The PI’s team has previously demonstrated that unstructured (i.e., free-text) EHR data can be used to study topics mentioned in clinical notes of AAV patients and that keywords in these notes can help identify AAV patients but neither machine learning nor sophisticated natural language processing have been previously used to identify AAV cases. In addition, our prior work has examined AAV complications in isolation (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease) but here we seek to identify phenotypes of complications (complication clusters) that tend to co-occur in patients, how patients transition between clusters over time, and what factors predict a person’s membership in a complication cluster. The major goal of this proposal is to build further preliminary data in preparation for an R01 application over the next 24 months. The planned R01 will focus on comparative effectiveness studies in AAV using cohorts assembled in big data and clinically-relevant, patient-oriented outcomes, like complication clusters. The results of these studies can then be used as inputs in simulation models built during my K23 to guide optimal patient-oriented treatment decisions. Ultimately, the goal of this research program is to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality by using data to inform personalized approaches to AAV treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite treatment advances, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) remains associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of death compared to the general population. To further improve these outcomes, we need to understand which medications work best to treat AAV and this requires a large group of patients to study and a better understanding of complications in AAV.

"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data Project Abstract/Summary Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools to support preparedness plans and decision-making. Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim 2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models. This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these algorithms to other US cities. Project Narrative We will develop innovative algorithms for detecting emerging respiratory viruses within US cities. To do so, we will model the syndemic dynamics of respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases and apply machine learning to combine geospatial data that track early indicators of emerging threats. Working with local public health and healthcare collaborators, we will translate this research into practical tools for addressing socio- geographic gaps in surveillance and accelerating the detection, prevention and mitigation of severe outbreaks.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results.

"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,10087958,R01LM013061,"['Automation ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' vector ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' patient population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' clinical risk ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' health data ', ' support tools ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' feature selection ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,455669,NY-13
"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",10086996,R01HL144692,"['clinical risk ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' support tools ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' data streams ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' simulation environment ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Insufflation ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Intraoperative Care ', ' Peroperative Care ', ' intra-operative care ', ' Intraoperative Period ', ' intra-operative period ', ' Intubation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' mortality ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' pressure ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Running ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' Otomy ', ' incision ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preconditioning ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' Skin ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Perioperative ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' information display ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' interoperability ', ' data structure ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' iterative design ', ' demographics ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' relational database ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,734363,CA-33
"Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  There are approximately 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. today. Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to late effects of therapy including chronic health conditions and premature death. Predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects, discussing how to manage these risks, and offering early preventions and interventions are critical components of survivorship care. Over 75% of childhood cancer survivors have prevalent symptoms, and constantly poor or worsening symptoms are associated with onset of medical late effects. However, regular symptom monitoring is uncommon in survivorship or primary care. The core concept of this R01 grant proposal is to enable regular monitoring of patient-generated health data (PGHD), including symptoms, physical activity, energy expenditure, sleep behavior and heart rate variability, and utilize these data in predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects to improve survivorship care and outcomes.  The proposed application will enroll 620 adult survivors of childhood cancer from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who are ≥5 years post diagnosis and currently ≥18 years of age at enrollment to achieve the following 3 specific aims: Aim 1) use a mobile health platform to collect dynamic PGHD data over 3 months and use them to develop and validate risk prediction models for future quality-of-life (QOL); Aim 2) develop/validate risk prediction models and establish personalized risk prediction scores for other outcomes (unplanned care utilization, physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) using the same approach as Aim 1; and Aim 3) create a web-based tool to calculate and report personalized outcome-specific risks, and facilitate integration of risk scores into the survivor’s patient portal and hospital’s Electronic Health Record (EHR).  We have a series of preliminary data to support this R01 grant proposal: a) in a pilot study assessing 20 common symptoms with a mobile health platform, childhood cancer survivors completed 90% of all required evaluations over 3 months; and b) in a prediction analysis from ongoing cohort of childhood cancer survivors, the inclusion of longitudinal symptom data generated a superior model performance in predicting future QOL (prediction measure, AUC=0.85) compared to the use of only age, sex, and childhood cancer type (AUC=0.63).  Linking through a mobile health platform, we will use a smartphone to collect symptom data, a wrist-worn accelerometer to collect momentary activity/behavioral data, and a finger sensor to collect heart rate variability data. We will predict patient-reported outcomes (poor QOL, unplanned healthcare utilization) and clinically- assessed outcomes (physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) on the 12th and 24th months after collecting risk factors. We will apply state-of-the-art machine/statistical learning techniques to capture features of dynamic changes in PGHD to predict these outcomes. We will build a Central Cancer Survivorship Platform to integrate predicted risks presented with interpretable scores into a patient portal and EHR, and to inform clinicians and survivors about potential adverse-event risks for risk management/intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop survivor-specific risk models to predict adverse outcomes of childhood cancer through collecting daily symptoms and other patient-generated health data (physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate variability) using mobile health devices. We will apply machine/statistical learning methods to develop and validate risk prediction models, and use qualitative methods to receive input from clinicians and survivors for developing a user-friendly dashboard and decision support tools. Our risk prediction tool will facilitate informing individualized levels of specific adverse outcomes, and providing key information for clinicians and survivors to discuss in view of preventive interventions.",Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes,10178979,R01CA258193,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', '

"Semi-supervised Approaches to Denoising Electronic Health Records Data for Risk Prediction Project Summary While clinical trials remain a critical source for oncology research, their study findings may not be gener- alizable to the real world due to the restricted patient population. In recent years, due to the increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and the linkage of EHR with specimen bio-repositories and other research registries, integrated large datasets now exist as a new source for translational research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based prediction models for disease progression and treatment response, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice. These models can also be contrasted with models derived from clinical trials, bridging the gap between clinical trials and the real world. However, efficiently deriving and evaluating personalized prediction models using such real world data (RWD) remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, validated outcome information from EHR, such as development of colon cancer and 1-year treatment response, requires laborious medical record review and hence is often not readily available for research. Naive use of error prone surrogates of the outcome, such as billing codes or procedure codes, as the true outcome may greatly hamper the power of EHR studies and produce biased results. Semi-supervised risk prediction methods, leveraging noisy surrogates and a small amount of human annotations on the outcome, may greatly improve the utility of EHR for precision medicine research. Deriving a precise estimate of the risk model becomes even more challenging when the number of candidate features is not small relative to the number of annotated outcomes. Another major challenge with EHR risk modeling lies in the transportability. Complex machine learning models trained in one EHR system often attain low accuracy in another EHR system, due to the heterogeneity in the patient population and healthcare system. Transfer learning methods that can automatically adjust model developed for one EHR cohort to better fit to another EHR cohort is of great value. Synthesizing information from multiple data sources can improve the quality of evidence. However, meta analyzing EHR from multiple EHR cohorts faces an additional challenge due to patient privacy. We address these challenges by developing semi-supervised risk prediction methods with high dimensional predictions in Aim 1; semi-supervised transfer learning methods to enable risk prediction modeling in target populations with no gold standard labels uted learin Aim 2; and distributed learning methods for high dimensional predictive modeling in Aim. Project Narrative The research proposal addresses the pressing need for advanced statistical tools that meet challenges in current development of prediction models with high dimensional predictors using noisy data from electronic medical records augmented by a small amount of gold standard outcomes. By providing statistical tools that enable clinical investigators to effectively develop accurate and interpretable risk prediction models, this proposal will join prior and ongoing research activities towards the goal of finding efficient and cost effective personalized disease management strategies.",Semi-supervised Approaches to Denoising Electronic Health Records Data for Risk

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually.

"Enhancing Assisted Reproductive Technologies with Deep Learning and Data Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) is a clinical treatment for infertile couples who want to achieve a pregnancy. In ART, embryologists fertilize eggs retrieved from the patient or a donor, culture the resulting embryos in vitro, and then transfer the selected embryo(s) to the mother's uterus. While ART is responsible for 1.9% of babies born in the United States as of 2018, selecting which embryo to transfer is a signiﬁcant challenge. The difﬁculty comes from the complexity of confounding factors and the lack of understanding of human pre-implantation embryo development. Because of this difﬁculty, multiple embryos are often transferred to increases the potential of success, resulting in multiple pregnancy rates of nearly 20%, which can lead to signiﬁcant morbidity and medical expenses to patients. The ideal is to transfer only a single embryo, but this necessitates the ability to select the best embryo from a cohort. Here, we propose to create a clinical decision support system to improve embryo selection in ART. To this end, we will develop novel deep learning models for robust embryo feature extraction and interactive data visualization methods for human-in-the-loop analysis. We will ﬁrst extract and analyze visual features from routinely collected images of embryos. We will then combine these visual features with patients' electronic health record (EHR) data to develop interpretable computation models that score embryos on their viability. We plan to integrate our machine learning solutions into an easily accessible cloud service platform that will be adaptable across clinics to improve ART embryo selection and clinical data analysis. Our research goals will be achieved by novel machine learning-based models for morphological feature extrac- tion and importance estimation of each confounding factor and a clinical decision support system for ART. For morphological feature extraction, we plan to conduct semi-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks to minimize manual labeling that requires extensive human effort. Our feature extraction model will be the ﬁrst comprehensive classiﬁcation and segmentation method for ART. To aid in embryo selection, we will develop novel deep learning-based models to predict probabilities of achieving pregnancy by accepting visual features and EHR data as the input. We will also develop visual analytic tools that allow analysts to better understand and steer these deep learning models. We will estimate the importance of each input interpretable factor in embryo selection to explain the prediction to embryologists. Finally, we will develop EmbryoProﬁler, a clinical decision support system for ART, that combines our machine learning-based models with a user-facing suite of visual analytic tools to support user guidance and clinical decision making. EmbryoProﬁler will help facilitate daily operation in clinics, foster human-guided decision making, enrich data-driven embryo analysis, and enhance the ability to select the developmentally most competent embryo for transfer to improve ART success rates. Our project will create state-of-the-art analysis approaches for ART clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a widespread treatment for infertility, over 300,000 treatment cycles were performed in the US in 2018, but success rates remain low. In this project, we will develop novel machine learning algorithms and a clinical decision support system to assist embryologists in embryo selection.

"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,10198019,K01HL141771,"['Accounting ', ' Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Boston ', ' Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ', ' chronic lung disease in infants ', ' chronic lung disease in neonatal infants ', ' chronic lung disease in neonates ', ' chronic lung disease in newborns ', ' chronic lung disease in prematurity ', ' infant chronic lung disease ', ' neonatal chronic lung disease ', ' newborn chronic lung disease ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Conceptions ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Patent Ductus Arteriosus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hospitals ', ' Teaching Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Premature Labor ', ' Premature Obstetric Labor ', ' Preterm Labor ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neonatology ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Physicians ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Retinopathy of Prematurity ', ' Retrolental Fibroplasia ', ' premature retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' portability ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' education planning ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Human Pathology ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' respiratory distress syndrome ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' clinical practice ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' clinical predictors ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' 37 weeks gestation ', ' 37 weeks completed gestation ', ' data resource ', ' insurance claims ', ' deep learning ', ' Data Scientist ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' structured data ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2021,166320,MA-07
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance Project Summary Post-surgical complications (PSCs) have been an increasing concern for hospitals, particularly in light of payment reform focusing on longer episodes and Medicare penalties for 30-day readmissions and adverse outcomes including deep or organ space surgical site infections (DOS-SSIs). Readmission due to post- discharge complications in particular has become a target for quality improvement since many of these events are considered preventable. The wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to a number of clinical risk models for PSCs. These modeling efforts have primarily been targeted at the surgical specialty areas within which a large number of events occur (such as colorectal surgery) as well as applying sophisticated statistical modeling / machine learning to allow for missing data, interactions, and nonlinearities. However, there is still considerable room for improvement both in terms of accuracy and generalizability. In our current funding period, we have demonstrated the predictive value of clinical notes for PSCs. However, one glaring limitation of current models is that they are trained on high volume surgical specialties at large tertiary care institutions with high quality clinical data and use of advanced informatics approaches. The impetus of this proposal is essentially two-fold: (i) Accurate models can be created for lower volume institutions and specialties via transfer learning and leveraging more data via unconfirmed outcomes (i.e., those that mimic gold standard outcomes, but are less reliable) with proper accounting of reliability. (ii) Decision making can be significantly improved by leveraging time varying, real-time data such as labs, vitals, and clinical notes to provide the current risk of PSCs for patients using all information as it becomes available. We aim to i) develop and apply longitudinal risk models for PSCs to explicitly account for the time varying nature of some of the information (e.g., labs, vitals, clinical notes) as it becomes available in real-time so that it can be integrated into the clinician’s decision making; ii) develop and apply transfer learning to PSC risk models; iii) develop modeling approaches that allow for the use of more widely available unconfirmed outcomes, while explicitly accounting for the additional uncertainty and bias due to the use of such unconfirmed outcomes when compared to a less available gold standard; and iv) develop a widely applicable framework for model evaluation and monitoring. Models will often not perform in practice as they do in research for a variety of reasons. This framework will allow us to identify these issues and more efficiently translate and apply these complex predictive models into practice so that the research can have an immediate clinical impact. Successful development would open the door for next generation patient monitoring, alerts, and interventions for all surgical specialties and all institutions. We will make the relevant modeling results publicly available so that lower volume institutions can leverage the transfer learning approach developed here without the need for our actual data. This will ultimately lead to improved patient care and lower overall cost by identifying complications early and limiting readmission due to PSCs at Mayo Clinic and other institutions across the nation. Narrative Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EHRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EHRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EHRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,10202598,R01EB019403,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Breast ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Colorectal Surgery ', ' Colon and Rectal Surgery ', ' colon and rectum surgery ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surgical Specialties ', ' Surgical Profession ', ' surgery specialty ', ' Surgical Wound Infection ', ' surgical site infection ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Translating ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' Glare ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' rapid growth ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' tertiary care ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' clinical risk ', ' genetic information ', ' Data Science ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical implementation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' unstructured data ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,630812,MN-01
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),10141287,R01HL141916,"['Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Paramedical Personnel ', ' Paramedic ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Running ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Traumatic Hemorrhage ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Refractory ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Melons ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' success ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' simulation ', ' Agreement ', ' Graph ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Organ failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' advanced system ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' iterative design ', ' demographics ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' signal processing ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Trauma patient ', ' support tools ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' in silico ', ' data streams ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,652539,PA-18
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,10206237,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Data Collection ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Sentinel ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' national surveillance ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' risk minimization ', ' surveillance data ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' comparative treatment ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data streams ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,486155,WA-07
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was

"Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families PROJECT ABSTRACT  To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati (MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates (GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.) We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC. To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families. Project Narrative Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) proposes to join eMERGE IV by enrolling of local Cincinnati African-American newborn babies and their mothers with available fathers and brothers and sisters to develop predictions of their risk for Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer (along with 15 disorders chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and disorders chosen by CCHMC Faculty) using genetic variation, environmental factors, and family history. We will test whether knowledge of having a higher genetic risk for these disorders will motivate closer adherence to health recommendations made to reduce disease risk.",Polygenic Risk Scores for

"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our team has developed and validated an assisted web-based interface for longitudinal clinical data collection of cognitive function measures, physical disability and depression measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death. This proposal uses natural language processing to improve on current research methodology in order to account for patient-specific, physician-specific, and system-specific factors in peripheral arterial disease care and outcomes.",Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques,10464976,F32HL151181,"['Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Inequality ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' ICD-10 ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' Provider ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' claudication ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment effect ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' provider adherence ', ' adherence by clinicians ', ' adherence by providers ', ' clinician adherence ', ' clinician compliance ', ' physician adherence ', ' physician compliance ', ' provider compliance ', ' ']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,85488,NC-04
"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance SUPPLEMENT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are data- driven approaches looking for patterns in massive datasets. While the AI/ ML algorithms rapidly advanced and built successful imaging processing applications, the promise of AI/ML in sepsis and antimicrobial resistance research remains largely unfulfilled. The main reasons stem from deficient, inaccessible and poorly labeled clinical data allowing for only a small portion of the electronic health records (EHR) data to be used. More so, clinical narratives such as notes and imaging reports which contain unstructured data elements in free text format are almost never used. Our parent K08 award aims to identify sepsis phenotypes at risk for MDR GNB that will enable better antibiotic prescribing practices and standardize comparisons across hospitals. We propose to accomplish our goal by leveraging big data and using innovative methods such as ML methods. This supplement will strengthen our project by analyzing in detail the barriers to efficiently using EHR data including unstructured data elements and providing data engineering solutions. The objective is to provide the framework for ML use in sepsis research. Demonstrating reproducibility and rigor of our ML methods and making the algorithms and datasets accessible per FAIR and TRUST principles will be responsive to NIGMS and broader NIH priorities. Our aims reflect these priorities: 1) Analyze barriers to use of EHR structured data and provide data engineering solutions for data enrichment, 2) Extract and assess the importance of unstructured data in developing ML sepsis models, and 3) Compare the ML sepsis models using unstructured and structured data VS structured data only and ensure algorithm fairness by testing it across subgroups of interest based on gender and race. We will incorporate clinical data from the 15 hospitals in our healthcare system serving an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patient population in rural, suburban and urban hospitals. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in sepsis research. This supplement complements and broadens the initial K08 award. It serves as the natural next step in deepening her expertise in innovative methods. This supplement will provide the opportunity for meaningful collaborations with data scientists with ample expertise in unstructured data methods and data engineers specialized in ML methods. It will help Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to promote clinically applicable algorithms for challenging problems such as sepsis treatment. For this supplement, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet will continue the collaboration with her multidisciplinary team of mentors and add data engineering support. An accredited course in unsupervised machine learning will be added to her career development plan. She will continue her path to becoming an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis with focus on data availability, the experienced mentorship team now incorporating data engineering expertise and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in sepsis and antimicrobial resistance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are critical issues.

"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! !

"Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach Project Summary There is growing evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning (ML) can perpetuate or even worsen social inequalities when deployed into real-world settings. This has been demonstrated in many realms, including policing, the court system, banking, social services provision, and there is growing concern the same is true in medicine. At the same time, there has been an outpouring of new AI-based interventions, with a ten-fold increase in the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for AI-based technologies since 2017. However, little research empirically examines the health equity implications of ML-based clinical decision-making tools. One clinical arena in which ML-based tools are already in use is emergency department (ED) triage, as an alternative to the common Emergency Severity Index (ESI) system. Despite its widespread popularity, evidence has shown that ESI-based triage has many problems, including poor acuity discrimination, with up to 50% of patients triaged at the midpoint of the scale, and is associated with racial inequalities, with African-American patients experiencing longer wait-times and lower triage levels controlling for illness severity. This study will use an ML-based ED triage tool that is already in use at a major academic medical center in the United States to explore the extent to which several factors are associated with inequality in predictive performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This research will take a mixed methods approach to concurrently examine both human and ‘machine’ elements that affect the triage tool’s final impact on patients. Aim 1 will be a qualitative study involving ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviewing of triage nurses, to develop a conceptual framework for clinicians’ understanding of and interaction with an ML-based tool. Aim 2 will examine ‘label bias’, a type of measurement bias. The Applicant will use synthetic and real electronic health record (EHR) data and simulate different levels of label bias, then examine predictive performance of the triage tool across patient racial/ethnic groups. Aim 3 will explore different methods for imputing missing EHR data. The Applicant will deploy common, simplistic deletion-based methods as well as a promising new ML-based imputation method called an autoencoder, apply the triage model to generate predictions and examine performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This project is innovative because it contributes to the development of a ‘life cycle’ model of ML-based tools and their health equity implications using a mixed methods approach that integrates both human and computational elements, while also providing a rigorous training plan for the Applicant, an MD-PhD student in epidemiology. This training plan is rigorous, synergistic yet diverse, and will include advanced coursework, dedicated 1-on-1 and group mentoring with experts in the field, attendance at seminars and targeted conferences, integration with clinical education and professional development. This project will be an essential step toward the Applicant’s maturation into an independent physician-scientist. Project Narrative This proposal represents a significant contribution to public health in that it seeks to improve upon current emergency department (ED) triage processes, which are associated with racial inequalities in wait time and triage severity. Specifically, this research will evaluate the performance of an alternative machine learning (ML) -based tool for ED triage across racial/ethnic groups, contributing to a more accurate and equitable triaging of patients and directly improving patient health outcomes. More broadly, this project will enhance the ability of many stakeholders, including data scientists, clinicians, researchers and health policy-makers to evaluate the health equity impacts of any proposed ML-based interventions for health.",Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach,10248299,F31LM013403,"['Critiques ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Police ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' base ', ' court ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' social inequality ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' health equity ', ' health inequalities ', ' Health Inequity ', ' Inequalities in Health ', ' Inequities in Health ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Personalized Rejection Risk Assessment in Cardiac Transplantation Project Summary: Cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) is a serious concern in transplant medicine, representing the leading threat to short- and long-term allograft survival. As a result, CAR surveillance and prevention is a primary focus of post-transplant care, with recipients undergoing frequent, scheduled, surveillance endomyocar- dial biopsy (EMB) for histologic CAR grading along with frequent, scheduled de-escalation of immunosuppres- sion (IS). The uniformity of this standardized approach to CAR mitigation is the result of an inability to employ reliable, proactive, and tailored strategies based on individual CAR risk. Consequently, patients at low CAR risk are exposed to unnecessary EMB procedures and excess IS therapy, while patients at high risk experience inadequate CAR surveillance and early/inappropriate weaning of IS. This exposes patients to potential harm, and highlights the clear, unmet need for precision CAR risk-assessment tools. The overarching premise for this proposal is that contained within the clinical data and EMB tissues already collected as part of usual care at transplant centers exists the means to provide actionable CAR risk assessments. Extensive immunologic, diag- nostic, and pharmacologic data are captured in electronic health records (EHR) at transplant centers, while large collections of EMB histology samples are stored (and often digitized) in pathology archives. This proposal seeks to utilize advanced machine-learning algorithms and in-situ diagnostic methods to deeply mine these archival resources for the purpose of validating novel CAR risk-prediction models. In Aim 1, we will leverage our experi- ence with automated histologic analysis pipelines to develop a ‘morphologic model’ for predicting future CAR using archived H&E slides. Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) histology slides are generated from all EMB events as part of standard-of-care. In published and patented prior efforts, we have extracted quantitative morphologic features from digitized H&E slides which, when modeled, demonstrate excellent performance for diagnosing myocardial injury and CAR grades. In Aim 2, we will move beyond standard H&E, leveraging our experience with quantitative, in-situ immune-profiling of transplant EMBs to develop a ‘morpho-molecular’ model for predicting future CAR. This aim will expand upon exciting pilot work which showed the CAR risk-stratification potential of combining quantitative image-analysis with multiplex immunofluorescence. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a ‘histo-informatics’ model for predicting CAR by integrating data from Aims 1 & 2 with comprehensive clinical informatics data extracted from the EHR. Ultimately, as a result of this work, we expect to validate a novel pre- cision prediction model for use in prospective investigations exploring personalized CAR surveillance and pre- vention strategies. Beyond the potential translational impact, this research plan will build on the Applicant’s knowledge of complex cohort design, integrated data modeling, and transplant immunodiagnostics. Along with planned coursework and a diverse mentoring, advisory, and collaborative team, this proposal provides the opti- mal vehicle for Dr. Peyster’s maturation into an investigator with proven expertise in multi-modality diagnostics. Project Narrative: There is considerable uniformity in the rejection surveillance and prevention protocols used in heart transplant medicine, primarily due to a lack of precision diagnostic tools for assessing individual rejection risk. The inability to provide personalized immunosuppression and biopsy schedules that are tailored to individual risk exposes patients to serious and avoidable opportunistic infections, procedural injuries, and rejection events. This proposal aims to apply advanced informatics, computer-vision, and in-situ diagnostic methods to archived clinical data and biopsy tissues in order to develop a rejection risk-prediction model

"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings.

"Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors PROJECT SUMMARY: Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Lili Chan's career development into an independently funded clinical investigator leveraging electronic health records (EHR) and improve risk prediction of adverse outcomes in patients on hemodialysis (HD) by incorporating social determinants of health. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Chan has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory team lead by Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Clinical Research in Nephrology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-mentor Dr. Peter Kotanko, Adjunct Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Research Director of the Renal Research Institute. Her advisory team consists of Dr. Weng, an expert and in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), Dr. Alex Federman, who has contributed significantly to the literature on the effects of psychosocial factors on patient care, and Dr. Mazumdar, an expert in biostatistics and risk prediction modeling. Dr. Chan's proposed training plan focuses on four areas, (1) advanced statistical methodology; (2) bioinformatics; (3) patient centered outcomes; and (4) career development. Environment: The Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research. Specifically the Division of Nephrology has over 30 funded investigators and has successfully mentored five faculty members from K awards to R01 awards. Research: Given the high morbidity and mortality of HD patients, there is a critical need for better risk stratification and identification of high risk groups in order for targeted interventions to be tested. This project utilizes prospectively collected surveys and retrospective chart review of a cohort of diverse patients on chronic HD who receive care from four Renal Research Institute and six Mount Sinai Health System hemodialysis units located throughout New York City. The Specific Aims of the research are: (1) to determine the association between domains of social determinants of health and hospitalizations using survey research methods; (2) to identify social determinants of health in an accurate manner using natural processing language; and (3) to create risk prediction models for hospitalization among patients on HD utilizing both standard measures and social determinants of health using standard statistical methods and machine learning. This research leverages novel computational methods to examine the association of social determinants of health and hospitalizations in HD patients and incorporates SDOH into risk prediction models which will allow for identification of high risk HD patients for inclusion in future intervention trials. The results of this proposal sets the foundation for future R01 studies validating these findings in external data sets and testing the utility of EHR integrated clinical decision tools on reducing hospitalizations, readmissions, and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients on hemodialysis have high rates of hospitalizations. Yet, social determinants of health (economic instability, education, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context, and health and healthcare access), which have previously been demonstrated to be associated with hospitalization in hemodialysis patients, are not easily identified and used in research. We plan to identify these factors using prospective surveys and natural language processing software on electronic health records, where these factors are routinely documented, and add these factors to standard clinical factors in complex machine learning models to identify patients at higher risk for hospitalization, and in the process train Dr. Lili Chan into an independent clinical investigator in the field of “big data” research in nephrology.",Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors,10127066,K23DK124645,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Coca ', ' Erythroxylon ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",10120737,R01NR017916,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Anesthesiology ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enabling Factors ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Public Health ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Perioperative Care ', ' Custom ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Nurse Anesthesiologist ', ' Nurse Anesthetists ', ' Certified registered nurse anesthetist ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Perioperative complication ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' user-friendly ', ' Network-based ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' health information technology ', ' waiver ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Patient risk ', ' cognitive process ', ' support tools ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' postoperative delirium ', ' post-operative delirium ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' clinical decision support ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' safety outcomes ', ' implementation framework ', ' implementation research framework ', ' implementation science framework ', ' remote monitoring ', ' remote patient monitoring ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,645032,MO-01
"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis

"Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data Project Summary/Abstract The routine operation of the US Healthcare system produces an abundance of electronically-stored data that captures the care of patients as it is provided in settings outside of controlled research environments. The potential for utilizing these data to inform future treatment choices and improve patient care and outcomes of all patients in the very system that generates the data is widely acknowledged. Given these key properties of the routine-care data and the abundance of electronic healthcare databases covering millions of patients, it is critical to strengthen the rigor of analyses of such data. Our group has previously developed an analytic approach to reduce bias when analyzing routine-care databases, which has proven effective in more than 50 empirical research studies across a range of topics and data sources. However, this approach currently cannot incorporate free-text information that is recorded in electronic health records, such as clinical notes and reports. This limitation has left a large amount of rich patient information underutilized for clinical research. We thus aim to adapt and refine a set of established computerized natural language processing algorithms that can identify and extract useful information from the clinical notes and reports in electronic health records and incorporate them into our validated analytical approach for balancing background risks of different comparison groups, a key step to ensure fair evaluation when comparing different therapeutic options. To test this newly integrated and augmented approach, we will implement and adapt it in simulation studies where we can evaluate and improve the performance of these new analytic methods in a controlled but realistic fashion. In addition, we will assess the performance of our new approach in 8 practical studies comparing medical or surgical treatments that are highly relevant to patients. To ensure highest level of data completeness and quality, we have linked multiple healthcare utilization (claims) databases, spanning from 2007 to 2016, with 3 electronic health records systems, including one each in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Texas. This data will allow testing of our newly integrated approach in a variety of care delivery systems and data environments, which will be very informative for the application of our products in the real-world settings. Narrative The project will yield a highly flexible and effective analytical method for reducing confounding bias in studies that utilize routine-care data to compare effects of medical or surgical treatments. This method will enable researchers to leverage a large amount of patient information recorded in the clinical notes and reports that are contained within electronic health records to adjust for differences in background risks of different comparison groups. Our proposal can improve the quality of evidence based on electronic healthcare data generated in the routine-care settings to better inform patient care and optimal prescribing.",Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data,10168610,R01LM013204,"['Algorithms ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Influentials ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' research study ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' safety study ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' operation ', ' treatment choice ', ' high dimensionality ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' preservation ', ' unstructured data ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Data Store ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,469927,MA-07
"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions).

"Sepsis online: learning while doing to understand biology and treatment PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT More than 1 million Americans are hospitalized with sepsis each year, and nearly one in five don’t survive. Most efforts to reduce sepsis deaths begin with the premise that patients are largely similar, and that ether moving treatment earlier or targeting therapeutics to a single mechanism will improve outcomes. In prior work funded by a NIGMS R35 award, we derived sepsis endotypes using a suite of machine learning methods inside the electronic health records (EHR) in a large integrated health system. These endotypes differed in biology, outcomes, and treatment response, and were reproduced in thousands of patients. But how will they lead to precision care? In this Renewal, we will leverage our clinical translational laboratory and remnant blood collection to better understand the biology of sepsis endotypes and explore new domains related to pathogen, microbiome, and molecular mechanisms. We will use Bayesian causal networks and reinforcement learning to optimize treatment policies over endotypes in more than 10 million EHR encounters. Finally, we will move learning online and embed endotypes inside the EHR at the point-of-care. These steps will take the science of sepsis endotypes and inform clinical decisions made under time pressure and uncertainty. By testing endotype treatment policies at the “live-edge”, we will strengthen causal inference, mechanistic insight, and learn while doing. My program will be supervised by external advisory boards with expertise in machine learning, inflammation, immunology, computational and systems biology, causal methods, artificial intelligence, and health information technology. This work will further develop my clinical-translational laboratory and cross-cutting mentorship of junior scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis endotypes are biological subtypes defined by distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms and identified by corresponding biomarkers. Endotypes may respond differently to sepsis treatment. Moving the science of sepsis endotypes from offline to online learning in the electronic health record has the potential to broaden our understanding of sepsis biology, improve causal inference, and advance precision care.",Sepsis online: learning while doing to understand biology and treatment,10169130,R35GM119519,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Ethers ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Science ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Immunology ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' American ', ' Systems Biology ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Molecular ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' microbiome ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' health information technology ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' improved outcome ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R35,2021,483099,PA-18
"3/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health factors, such as employment and educational attainment, can increase the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, as well as (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will generate new data in improving our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are highly prevalent in the general population and have a huge societal burden. Given the substantial heritability of these conditions and their polygenic architecture, there is increasing interest in using quantitative measures of genetic risk (polygenic risk scores) for risk stratification. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques for development of PRSs and their association to clinical outcomes and social determinants using large-scale integrated phenotype-genotype data.","3/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders",10197807,R01MH121923,"['Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Employment ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' psychogenetics ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' European ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' technique development ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' therapy resistant ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' social health determinants ', ' treatment-resistant depression ', ' treatment-refractory depression ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' deep learning ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' social determinants ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' structured data ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,429337,NY-13
"Multilevel Determinants of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic Abstract Annually in the U.S., nearly 60,000 women experience severe maternal morbidity and mortality (SMMM) with substantial health disparities by race/ethnicity, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has hit communities of color the hardest. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women who are pregnant appear to have disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 infection and death rates. Questions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial disparities in SMMM and the dynamics and interactions of multilevel determinants such as broader social contexts of SMMM remain unanswered. The overarching goal of this study is to investigate racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality (MMM), the contributing roles and mediating pathways of social contexts (e.g., residential segregation, racial discrimination in poverty, education, unemployment, and home ownership), and their long-standing health consequences postpartum. We will achieve our goal by studying the distributions of COVID-19 cases and multilevel determinants of maternal health in South Carolina (SC), a state with persistent racial disparities in SMMM within historical systemic Southern contexts, and in the U.S. We will build upon our existing statewide SC COVID-19 Cohort (S3C) by creating a pregnancy cohort that will link COVID-19 testing data, electronic health records (EHR), and birth certificate data for all births in SC in 2019-2020. To ensure the generalizability of our findings, we will confirm them using EHR data from the ongoing National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Nationwide social context databases and time-varying COVID-19 severity and social distancing policies will be added to S3C and N3c data. We will use the socio-ecological framework and employ a concurrent triangulation, mixed methods study design to achieve three specific aims: 1) to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic disparities in MMM; 2) to examine and explore how the key features of social contexts have contributed to the widening of racial/ethnic disparities in MMM during the pandemic (Aim 2a) and identify distinct mediating pathways through maternity care and mental health (Aim 2b); and 3) to examine the role of social contextual factors and identify protective factors for racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related, long-standing morbidities using machine learning algorithms. For Aim 2b, a convergent parallel design will be used, which includes a quantitative analysis of data from SC PRAMS and qualitative interviews of postpartum women (20 Black, 20 Hispanics) and 10 maternal care providers. Our experienced team is well positioned to investigate the complexity of racial disparities in MMM during the COVID-19 pandemic, while considering historical structural racism in a racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse population of pregnant women. A rigorous examination of social contexts on racial/ethnic disparities in MMM and mental health during the pandemic will inform continuing efforts to reverse the rising trends of SMMM in the U.S. Our proposal addresses Areas 1, 2, & 4 in the NOT-OD-21-071. Narrative Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented societal disruptions to individuals, communities, healthcare institutions, and society as a whole, it has hit communities of color the hardest. Empirical data on the scope of widening racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality and how historical structural racism and discrimination of all types have impacted women of color disproportionally are sparse. This study will be among the first to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic, structural racism, and racial discrimination– exposures with broad scale and reach – have contributed to the racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Multilevel Determinants of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in

"Curation at scale: Integrating AI into community curation Project Summary Biological knowledgebases are a critical resource for researchers and accelerate scientific discoveries by providing manually curated, machine-readable data collections. However, the aggregation and manual curation of biological data is a labor-intensive process that relies almost entirely on professional biocurators. Two approaches have been advanced to help with this problem: natural language processing (NLP; text mining (TM) and machine learning (ML)) and engagement of researchers (community curation). However, neither of these approaches alone is sufficient to address the critical need for increased efficiency in the biocuration process. Our solution to these challenges is an NLP-enhanced community curation portal, Author Curation to Knowledgebase (ACKnowledge). The ACKnowledge system, currently implemented for the C. elegans literature, couples statistical methods and text mining algorithms to enhance community curation of research articles. We propose to strengthen and expand ACKnowledge by including other species into our pipeline, incorporating more sophisticated machine learning models, and presenting sentence-level entity and concept extraction for more detailed author curation. In addition, we will develop an Author Curation Portal (ACP) to allow authors to easily upload and curate their own documents. Taken together, these enhancements will allow us to maximize community curation efforts by leveraging author expertise in multiple areas of biology, while at the same time supporting authors with as much AI-assisted curation as possible. This reciprocal interaction will improve not only the content of knowledgebases, but the AI methods themselves, as we will receive valuable feedback on our models. By developing an Author Curation Portal, we will further empower authors to participate in the curation process and alert knowledgebases to key information that can, and should, be readily discoverable in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Project Narrative The pace at which biological knowledge is published in the scientific literature far surpasses the ability of professional biocurators to collate and annotate such knowledge in a timely fashion. However, knowledgebases are a critical component of biological research whose utility depends on prompt entry of new data. Combining the dual benefits of text mining and community curation, the proposed ACKnowledge system, readily generalized, presents a novel approach to aiding curation by guiding authors to efficiently and accurately annotate their papers, thus quickly and reliably adding new information to knowledgebases.",Curation at scale: Integrating AI into community curation,10344771,R01LM013871,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Feedback ', ' Gold ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Names ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Paper ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Ingestion ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Speed ', ' member ', ' Bypass ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biological research ', ' learning engagement ', ' dashboard ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' WormBase ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' genome resource ', ' ']",NLM,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,355938,CA-27
"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning. This project concerns development of technologies to quantify and enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning , where, currently, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy.

"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",10064003,R00HL141678,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Critical Care ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Competence ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' cognitive function ', ' Physical Function ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Statistical Bias ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Reporting ', ' Regaine ', ' Rogaine ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' hands-on learning ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' ventilation ', ' emotional functioning ', ' patient health information ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2021,249000,PA-03
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,10091381,R01AG060993,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Alabama ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutes ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Sample Size ', ' Descriptor ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' phrases ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' validation studies ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' model development ', ' Ally ', ' Provider ', ' ward ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' elder care ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' virtual ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' confusion assessment method ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' high dimensionality ', ' care costs ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' acute care ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,376860,AL-07
"Large scale clinical and economic impact analysis of potentially malignant incidental findings in radiology reports Abstract Unexpected findings, or incidentalomas, are increasing dramatically with the growth in the use of imaging technology within healthcare organizations. Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy in the medium or long term. However, they also may lead to overinvestigation, unnecessary radiation exposure, overtreatment, substantial downstream expenditures, and patient anxiety. Several systematic reviews have explored the prevalence and outcomes of incidentalomas. These studies used inconsistent and often inappropriate synthesis methods, commonly only focusing on one imaging scan or organ in a very limited number of patients. As a result, there is need for large-scale study of incidentalomas that can inform their follow up and guide efforts to optimize health outcomes. To address this need, we propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches to identify cancer-related incidentalomas reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and to create the first large-scale incidentaloma database covering over half-a-million patients (Aim 2). Our research dataset will contain radiology reports, clinical notes containing imaging orders, as well as structured data such as demographic information (e.g., age) and diagnoses codes of patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC), Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center (NWMC) between 2007-2019. Our patient population will be linked to Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research (HICOR) data repository for detailed cancer outcomes and claims data. The created database will be used for clinical and economic analysis of incidentalomas (Aim 3). We will (1) evaluate the concordance between radiologists' documentation of incidentaloma follow-up and established clinical guidelines for thyroid, lung, adrenal, kidney, liver, and pancreas incidentalomas, (2) determine risk of subsequent cancer diagnosis and median survival for each category of incidentaloma, and (3) determine the incremental cost associated with follow-up imaging in patients with incidentalomas. All models and their implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open source. Additionally, the de-identified incidentaloma database will be made available to the research community under a data use agreement. By identifying risk factors for cancer diagnosis and death for common incidental findings, we will be able to provide critical information for future clinical practice guideline development and appropriate use criteria. We assembled a highly interdisciplinary team of experts in NLP, medical informatics, radiology, oncology, health outcomes, and health economics to ensure the successful completion of the proposed project. Project Narrative Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy to the patient in the short or medium term, but also may lead to overtreatment, which comes with substantial downstream expenditures as well as patient anxiety. In this project, we will build natural language processing approaches to extract cancer related incidentalomas reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and create the first large scale incidentaloma database for half-a-million patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center between 2007 and 2019 (Aim 2).

"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Identification of Trauma-related Features in EHR Data for Patients with Psychosis and Mood Disorders Project Summary Psychotic and mood disorders represent a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. There is considerable clinical heterogeneity among patients. Developing clinically implementable machine learning (ML) tools to enable accurate patient stratification is critically important in order to augment effective personalized treatment plans. Among the factors contributing to heterogeneity, childhood trauma is an under-recognized source. The prevalence of childhood trauma is significant in adults with psychiatric disorders. Robust evidence shows that: i) individuals exposed to childhood abuse are 2-3 times more likely to develop a psychiatric disorder later in life, particularly psychosis; ii) childhood traumas impact critical windows of brain development and can trigger the onset of psychosis; and iii) among patients with psychotic and mood disorders, childhood trauma influences psychopathology, leading to more severe symptoms, poorer long-term outcomes (longer and higher rate of relapses or rehospitalization), associated with substance abuse, and are often treatment resistant and function poorly in society. Although evidence clearly indicates that childhood trauma contributes to psychiatric risk and poor treatment outcomes, large-scale computational approaches to stratify subpopulations, extract trauma features (e.g., frequency, type), and examine the links or the impact of trauma features on psychopathology and treatment outcome have yet to be developed. We propose to create gold standard annotations from Electronic health records (EHRs) and to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and ML methods to develop a standardized re-useable data model for automatically extracting trauma-related features, complex concepts, and symptom dimensions from EHRs. We will train and evaluate a semi-supervised NLP model, which is built as a joint sequence model that can both identify named entities as well as extract the relations between them. We will apply multiple strategies to validate the robustness of our model. Our proposed NLP model is essentially a “computational version of a chart review” tool, designed to mimic human chart review but performed automatically with the ability to scale. We will use this model to stratify psychosis subgroups (with or without childhood trauma history) and to correlate among the extracted features with important clinical outcome variables. Importantly, the annotation guidelines, corpus, and the data model developed by us will be valuable resources to researchers in the field. The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in psychiatric phenotyping and application of EHRs, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in ML to natural language data. The model architecture developed in this application will lay the groundwork for a future clinical trial application. Project Narrative There is considerable clinical heterogeneity among patients with psychotic and mood disorders. This project will use electronic health record databases and machine learning approaches to automatically stratify subpopulations, to examine the impact of childhood trauma on psychopathology, and to establish a gold standard annotation guideline and a standardized re-useable data model for use by the psychiatric community.

"Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major challenge in caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determining the optimal therapy. Several effective biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available for RA, reflecting both advances in therapy, and the heterogeneity of RA; subsets of patients respond while others do not. Prior studies focused on patients with a good response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the most common bDMARD, with limited success in finding predictors that can be used in clinical care. This proposal seeks to address that gap in knowledge by taking a different direction. The objective of this study is to focus on exceptional bDMARD non-responders, defining and characterizing patients who have been on ≥3 classes of bDMARDs for RA. We will test whether data available in clinical electronic health record data (EHR) or genomic data can identify exceptional non-responders from TNFi responders. In Aim 1, we leverage data from an EHR cohort of ~16K RA patients to determine clinical factors associated with exceptional non-response using traditional epidemiologic approaches. As well, we will apply approaches using machine learning and topic modeling that will enable us to evaluate the predictiveness of a broader range of features. Examples of features include billing codes, prescriptions, and medical concepts extracted from text notes using natural language processing. In Aim 2, we will test whether RA genetic risk factors available in a subset of patients in Aim 1, and those of other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. axial spondyloarthropathy, can predict exceptional non- response to bDMARD therapy. As part of aim 2, we will also incorporate any predictive clinical factors identified in Aim 1 through the traditional or topic modeling approach. The overarching hypothesis is that the exceptional non-responders may be less “RA-like” than patients who respond to TNFi, with fewer RA genetic risk alleles and classic RA features from the narrative notes. This definition provides a new way to sub- phenotype RA, focusing on those that will have a poor response to therapy. This study is significant because a screen will be helpful not only in the clinic but can also identify patients to target for future studies of novel drug targets. This approach is innovative because it considers contemporary data where patients now have more “opportunity” to fail 3 classes of bDMARDs, where in the past there were only a limited number available. These data will be examined both using traditional epidemiologic models and newer approaches such as topic modeling that can integrate a broader range of data types. Finally, this proposal is designed to anticipate a time when patients will come for their visit with genetic data as part of their medical record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune joint disease worldwide. In line with NIAMS’ mission to conduct research in the treatment of arthritis, this proposal will investigate approaches using recent data and state-of-the-art approaches to improve RA management.

"Advancing Drug Repositioning for Alzheimer’s Disease using Real-world Data Project Summary: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is the 6th leading cause of death affecting about 5.7 million Americans. Generally, one in five women and one in ten men are expected to develop AD/ADRD; and the number of people living with AD/ADRD is expected to grow to 14 million in the next two decades. The quality of life of AD/ADRD patients is gradually diminished and caring for AD/ADRD patients imposes tremendous emotional and financial burden on family caregivers, communities, and healthcare systems. However, up until now, there is no cure and not even effective treatment for AD/ADRD patients, probably due to the complex mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD/ADRD. As drug development is becoming increasingly expensive and time-consuming (with estimated cost from $648 million8 to $2.5 billion9 and an average of 9-12 years for new drugs), drug repurposing, aiming to discover new uses of existing drugs, is one potential solution to speed up the drug development for AD/ADRD. However, previous attempts on drug repurposing for AD/ADRD based on omics data have not been successful so far, indicating that animal models may not translate to humans as readily as hoped. New methods that can speed up drug development for AD/ADRD are needed. In this study, we propose to detect drugs that can be potentially repurposed for AD/ADRD using 4 unique EHR data sets. This study will address the critical challenges of EHR-based drug repurposing including incomplete patient’s information and misclassification error associated bias. Aim 1 will focus on a drug repurposing knowledgebase for AD/ADRD, natural language processing methods to extract risk factors from clinical narratives, and phenotyping algorithms to accurately identify MCI and AD/ADRD patients to support the patient cohort construction. In Aim 2, we will develop drug repurposing methods that account for the high-dimensional of risk factors and misclassification error associated bias and apply them to detect drug repurposing signals using large collections of EHRs from (1) the OneFlorida network (2) the Cerner Health Facts database, (3) EHR from physician practice at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and (4) EHR data from the University of Pennsylvania. In Aim 3, we propose to validate the top-ranked signals through a prospective cohort study. We will recruit patients and routinely collect detailed pragmatic information and genotypes to validate the efficacy of the identified drug signals. The success of our study will: (1) produce a knowledgebase with timely updated risk factors, biomarkers, genotypes, and drug signals for AD/ADRD, (2) develop an open- source drug repurposing package - RAIDER (Repurposing Alzheimer Impacting Drugs using Electronic health Records) for AD/ADRD, and (3) generate drug repurposing signals validated in a prospective cohort study, which will inform the design of future large-scale national trials for AD/ADRD.

"Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data"" PROJECT SUMMARY Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. With statistical modeling and machine learning, these datasets have been be used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, decision support, cost reduction, and personalized medicine. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing. A common approach to addressing this problem is to apply data checks that filter the EHR for patients whose data appear to be more “complete”. Examples of filters include requiring at least one visit per year or ensuring that age, sex, and race are all recorded. However, in a previous study using EHR data from seven institutions, we showed that these filters can greatly reduce the sample size and introduce unexpected biases by selecting sicker patients who seek care more often and changing the demographics of the resulting cohorts. This project extends this prior research by implementing an expanded set of data completeness filters and testing their accuracy and potential biases using a combination of national claims data and EHR data from dozens of hospitals and healthcare centers across the country. This will enable us to understand how data completeness varies in different EHRs and quantify the tradeoffs of different approaches to correcting for gaps in patients' records. First, we will develop and measure the accuracy of data completeness filters using national claims data. This provides a “gold standard” of longitudinal data where patients' complete medical histories are known during the periods in which they were enrolled in the insurance plan. After partitioning the data by provider groups to model gaps in EHR data, we will test how well data completeness filters, individually and in combined machine learning models, select patients with fewer gaps. We will then test whether the filters introduce biases by selecting sicker patients (more diagnoses, more visits, etc.) or changing their demographic characteristics (age, sex, and zip code). Then, we will test the filters on EHR data, first at a single large medical center, and then across a national network of 57 institutions, representing different geographic regions, patient populations, number of years of data, and types of health care facilities. We will evaluate the filters by measuring whether they improve the performance of a machine learning model for predicting hospital admissions. Our ultimate goals are to (a) help researchers balance the need for complete data with the biases this might introduce to their models and (b) help them predict how well models trained on one EHR dataset might work on other EHRs with different data completeness profiles.

"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout PROJECT SUMMARY Professional burnout is a growing epidemic with symptoms affecting over 500,000 US physicians at any given time and carries significant adverse consequences for physician mental health, health care value, quality of care, and patient safety. There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify work environments at high risk for physician burnout, and tailor process improvements accordingly. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a real-time prediction model that uses operational data in primary care practices to identify high-risk clinics for physician burnout, enabling timely and tailored process improvements. The central hypothesis is that routinely-collected electronic health record (EHR) usage metrics coupled with practice-specific metrics can predict physicians’ risk for burnout and inform process improvement. The rationale for the proposed research is that early identification of high-risk clinics will allow organizations to tailor interventions to those clinics before burnout and its individual or health system consequences arise. This would be an innovative approach that prevents burnout rather than reacting to it. This project capitalizes on routinely-collect data from Stanford primary care clinics to create a database encompassing EHR usage metrics and practice-specific metrics. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop a prediction model to quantify risk for physician burnout. The working hypothesis is that real-time metrics of practice efficiency tracked by the EHR and other practice-specific metrics can predict physician burnout using a machine learning approach. Aim 2: Refine the prediction model using qualitative methods. The working hypothesis is that qualitative assessment will inform refinements to the prediction model created in Aim 1, and will demonstrate the face validity of the model. Aim 3: Validate the use of the prediction model to identify high-risk clinics. The working hypothesis is that quality of care metrics will demonstrate the concurrent validity, that subsequent routinely administered burnout surveys will demonstrate the predictive validity of the prediction model created in Aims 1 and 2, when aggregated at the clinic level. This proposal is significant because physician burnout is a growing problem with important implications for patient safety. It is also innovative in deploying machine learning and mixed methods to identify physicians at increased risk for burnout which will enable testing interventions to reverse this trend. In combination with formal training in quantitative and qualitative methods, expert mentorship, and participation in selected scholarly activities at Stanford, the experience gained through this project will facilitate progress toward a long-term goal to become an academic leader advancing evidence-based reform of the health care delivery system to optimize human factors that improve quality and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify and improve work environments with high risk for physician burnout, and doing so will have broad public health relevance by reducing risk for burnout and its negative effects on quality and safety of care. Addressing physician burnout in primary care carries relevance for AHRQ’s priority populations of women, children, the elderly, and low-income patients, who are particularly dependent on high quality primary care. This project will support AHRQ’s mission of producing evidence to make health care safer and higher quality by developing and validating a prediction model to identify high-risk primary care clinics for physician burnout in order to 1) inform resource allocation to clinics with the highest need, 2) tailor process improvements to reduce risk for burnout and poor quality of care, and 3) lay the groundwork for expanding this model to other high-risk practice settings and provider types.",Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout,10252902,K08HS027837,[''],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,152581,CA-18
"Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million US adults, with high rates of hospitalization and nearly 50% mortality at 5 years from diagnosis. Nearly half of these patients have systolic HF with multiple evidence-based therapeutic options proven to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in this subgroup of patients. Evaluating the appropriate utilization of these therapies is currently limited to post-hoc assessments of manually abstracted patient records at a limited number of hospitals participating in quality improvement registries. These manual abstraction strategies do not offer opportunities to improve care in real-time, and even at hospitals engaged in quality improvement efforts, only 1 in 5 of eligible patients with HF receive all first-line evidence based medical treatments. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Rohan Khera proposes to leverage the ubiquitous digitization of medical records in the electronic health record (EHR) to address the adequate utilization of evidence based medical therapy in HF. He proposes to use a large, publicly accessible, deidentified EHR database to develop and validate an algorithm that uses deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) within unstructured clinical documentation for hospitalized HF patients to identify those with systolic HF (Aim #1). He will engage clinicians to design consensus-based algorithms to identify contraindications to HF treatments, developed as algorithms within the EHR (Aim #2). Finally, he will construct a prototypic clinical decision support (CDS) tool identifying HF treatment eligibility in real-time using the algorithms and evaluate potential implementation strategies using qualitative evaluation of feedback from clinicians and patients (Aim #3). While proposed as a strategy to evaluate quality of care of individual patients, the proposed research will also model a fully automated electronic clinical quality measure for HF. The algorithms will be made open source to allow institutions to validate and apply them to their individual care setting. The proposal is supported by strong mentorship from experts in quality measure design, informatics, advanced NLP, CDS design, and qualitative research methodology. The facilities at Yale Center of Outcomes Research and Evaluation, which designs and evaluates national quality measures, and has access to computational resources required to accomplish the research goals as well as to the Yale EHR to validate the models are major strengths of the application. The proposed period of mentored research will support Dr. Khera’s training in medical informatics, advanced analytic tools such as NLP, and qualitative research methodology. The experience and skillset acquired during this period will support Dr. Khera’s transition to independence where he plans to lead multi-institutional collaboratives to evaluate the use of automated tools in the measurement and improvement of the quality of medical care in HF. The career development plan that accompanies the proposal is designed to support Dr. Khera’s long-term career goal to be a national leader in the design and implementation of informatics- based approaches of delivering high quality, patient-centered, cardiovascular care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scope of quality improvement programs that focus on improving the utilization of first-line evidence-based medical therapies in patients with heart failure is limited by mechanisms to identify those who are eligible for specific treatments. The current proposal aims to design automated tools to identify patients eligible for heart failure therapies using various data components already captured in the electronic health record in hospitalized patients. The proposal will then pilot test strategies of improving treatment utilization with electronic alerts delivered to clinicians based on these tools.",Evaluating and Improving Utilization of

"Personalized Predictions for Glaucoma Progression Using Artificial Intelligence for Electronic Health Records Project Summary/Abstract: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, affecting over 60 million people worldwide. Glaucoma patients vary widely in their presentation, with some retaining long-term disease stability, and others progressing quickly to vision loss. If glaucoma patients at highest risk of progression could be identified early, clinicians could better personalize their treatment approaches. Many clinical factors that affect glaucoma progression, such as intraocular pressure, treatment history, and medication adherence, are documented within the free-text notes of the electronic health records (EHR) and are not in large-scale administrative claims databases. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the integration of the rich and complex EHR data into highly accurate predictive algorithms for health outcomes in medicine and surgery. We hypothesize that we can extend these AI and NLP techniques to build predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression that outperform traditional models reliant on only administrative features. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using large-scale EHR data, while developing Dr Wang's expertise in AI and NLP, advancing her career as an independent clinician scientist. Aim 1 focuses on using the structured clinical data within the EHR, which are numeric or coded and readily machine-readable, to build baseline machine learning models predicting glaucoma progression requiring surgery. Aim 2 focuses on using and augmenting clinical named entity recognition tools to integrate information from EHR free text into AI models predicting glaucoma progression to surgery. Aim 3 focuses on understanding, explaining, and evaluating the performance of AI algorithms in a real-world prospective setting, by evaluating their performance on key subpopulations, their reliance on key features, and investigating potential areas of bias in a new cohort of glaucoma patients. This proposal is innovative in developing AI-based predictive algorithms for glaucoma progression using numeric and textual clinical data uniquely available in the EHR. The tools and methods Dr Wang will build and evaluate will substantially impact the ophthalmology field by enabling evidence-based tailoring of treatment approaches to patients' unique clinical characteristics, a step towards precision medicine. Furthermore, the careful evaluation of AI predictive algorithms on a new cohort of patients will provide insights into their performance on key subpopulations and reliance on key features, which is critical to advancing our understanding of possible limitations of deploying AI in the clinical workflow. Dr. Wang's career and research will advance under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tina Hernandez-Boussard, a national leader in informatics and expert in using NLP on EHR to improve patient care. Her outstanding Advisory Committee, including clinician-investigators Drs. Pershing, Stein, Chang, and Goldberg, will ensure Dr. Wang's success in becoming an independent clinician-investigator integrating ophthalmology and informatics.

"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them. In particular, this study seeks to use electronic health records and biobanks to identify genomic variation associated with treatment resistance.",2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders,10074155,R01MH116269,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clozapine ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroconvulsive Therapy ', ' Electric Convulsive Therapy ', ' Electric Shock Therapy ', ' Electroconvulsive Psychotherapy ', ' Electroconvulsive Shock Therapy ', ' Electroconvulsive treatment ', ' Electroshock Psychotherapy ', ' Electroshock Therapy ', ' Electroshock treatment ', ' electric shock treatment ', ' electro-convulsive therapy ', ' electroplexy shock therapy ', ' shock treatment ', ' Engineering ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and

"Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with symptoms that directly impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While catheter ablation is routinely performed to reduce AF symptoms and improve HRQoL, we lack evidence about which symptoms are likely to improve and for which patients. Ablations themselves may cause complications that lead to lower HRQoL. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely encouraged practice to navigate such complex choices by aligning treatment benefits and risks with the patient's stated values. However, no SDM interventions have focused explicitly on AF symptoms due to a lack of rigorous evidence about post-ablation symptom patterns and the decision aids necessary to communicate those findings. In this K99/R00 application, we propose to use data from electronic health records (EHRs) to characterize post-ablation symptom patterns, and display them in decision-aid visualizations to support personalized SDM about the best treatment modalities for an individual's patient's AF symptoms. In the K99 phase, we will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to extract and analyze symptom data from narrative notes in EHRs. We will also employ a rigorous, user-centered design protocol created during my postdoctoral work to develop decision-aid visualizations. In the R00 phase, we will conduct a feasibility study in which the interactive decision-aid visualizations are introduced during consultations about ablation in clinical electrophysiology practices. Our specific aims are: (1) identify common symptom patterns in patients with paroxysmal AF post-catheter ablation (n>32,014); (2) develop and evaluate decision-aid visualizations of common AF symptom patterns (n=50); and (3) evaluate the feasibility of implementing the decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice (n=75). The training objectives of this project include mastering competencies in NLP, ML, human-computer interaction, symptom science, and implementation science. The long-term training goal is to assist Dr. Reading Turchioe to become a faculty member with an independent program of research. She seeks to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians committed to improving symptom management and HRQoL for individuals living with AF and other chronic cardiovascular conditions, with an eye towards health equity. To ensure success for the planned research and training activities, a multidisciplinary team of mentors with complementary expertise, established, well-funded programs of research, and a record of mentoring high-quality trainees will advise her. Moreover, this research will be conducted in a world-class academic medical center with exceptional resources for building and implementing technology and data science methods using EHR data. The proposed research is both significant and innovative: NLP and ML methods to extract EHR data for decision-aid visualizations are a novel approach to SDM in the understudied area of AF symptoms. Together, these techniques promise to enhance HRQoL for other AF treatment modalities (e.g. medications, lifestyle changes) and other chronic cardiovascular conditions. ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Our research has public health significance because atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and expected to double in prevalence in the next decade as the population ages. “Real-world evidence” from electronic health record data displayed in personalized decision-aid visualizations can enable patients and providers to choose together the optimal treatments for symptom reduction. Our proposal addresses NINR's key areas of “Symptom Science: Promoting Personalized Health Strategies” and “Promoting Innovation: Technology to Improve Health” by leveraging innovative technologies to deliver personalized interventions that reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life for individuals with chronic conditions. !",Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in

"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this field typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind  admission risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modifiable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital  admissions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classification models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to significantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close  mentoring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a  supportive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identification and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,10134412,K23HL141639,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' TimeLine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Interstitial Lung Diseases ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Chronic lung disease ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' Policy Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' discrete data ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trial design ', ' supportive environment ', ' enthusiastic atmosphere ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' supportive atmosphere ', ' risk prediction model ', ' statistical learning ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' clinical encounter ', ' clinical center ', ' Home ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173801,PA-03
"Domain-Knowledge Informed Deep Learning for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to leverage deep-learning algorithms on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a malignancy with high mortality and morbidity. Although numerous risk factors have been identified, PDAC is most often found in later stages when effective treatments are not feasible or their survival benefit is limited. In this R21, we aim to develop novel structured methodologies for systematically incorporating feature grouping strategy from expert domain knowledge into the training procedure of deep-learning algorithms for improving PDAC diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis for this study is that the groups of highly correlated variables will combine to form superior and interpretable predictors compared to individual clinical variables (current proposal). Furthermore, these new predictors represented by the group of related data will be useful for other downstream tasks such as risk factor identification via causal discovery (future research). The proposed research presents an innovative approach towards unifying human and artificial intelligence, using explainable algorithms to build interpretable prediction models, in contrast to conventional deep-learning algorithms which are non-traceable by humans due to their black-box nature. An optimal strategy for creating composite (grouped) variables should maximize both predictive power as well as human-interpretability. We will thus explore a variety of grouping strategies relying heavily on human-expert knowledge (e.g. clinical workflows) as well as auto-correlation tests. An effective grouping strategy will allow our prediction model to learn the relative importance of both individual measurements as well as interpretable groups of measurements in predicting PDAC. Examples in the literature show that such grouped predictors often have superior predictive power compared to their individual components, which can be attributed to the mutual information shared within the group. Different types of explainable (attention) neural networks may also be applied depending on the group characteristics to further improve interpretability as well as prediction accuracy. We believe that similar methodologies applied to predictive modeling in healthcare data have the potential to fundamentally advance clinical decision making with improved model interpretability. The success of this proposal will be leveraged in a larger ongoing project which aims to establish new causal relationships between various risk factors associated with PDAC. This involves an advanced graph-based approach for building interpretable models. Our direct application of causal discoveries in the future research will be a program for collecting patient-generated health data (PGHD) for PDAC early diagnosis. The goal of this proposal is to develop new protocols for the early detection of pancreatic cancer using a novel strategy for combining human-expert knowledge with deep-neural embeddings. Our study involves a structured exploration of feature grouping strategies using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to develop predictive and potentially insightful deep learning models. We will be able to propose new predictors represented by groups of related data that are expected to have superior predictive ability for improving pancreatic cancer diagnosis.",Domain-Knowledge Informed Deep Learning for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer,10317236,R21CA265400,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Statistical Study ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' direct application ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' demographics ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' electronic structure ', ' data format ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' health data ', ' Data Analytics ', ' associated symptom ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' feature extraction ', ' pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model ', ' PDA model ', ' PDAC Model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,176874,NY-13
"High Performance Text Mining for Translator We propose to build a knowledge provider that will seek out, integrate and provide AI-ready, BioLink-compatible models via high-performance text-mining of the biomedical literature. Problems with Translator’s current mining of the biomedical literature that we intend to solve include: (1) weaknesses in framework extensibility and benchmarking that make integrating and validating new text-mining approaches difficult; (2) problematic licensing of software, terminologies and other resources that do not adequately support FAIR (and TLC) best practices; (3) processing only PubMed titles and abstracts, not full text publications; (4) Translator’s use of older NLP technology with relatively poor performance; (5) lack of a mechanism for community feedback regarding errors and other problems; (6) lack of continuous updates to add knowledge from new publications; (7) output knowledge representation that is simplistic and vague, failing to reflect the richness of what is expressed in scientific documents. Plan for implementation: Our team has a long history of productive NLP research, successful open source software projects, effective benchmarking and broad community engagement. We will build on the results of NLM-funded work in information extraction, our gold-standard Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) corpus, a recent BioNLP Open Shared Task (BioNLP-OST) that we organized, and recent advances in state-of-the-art NLP. For Segment 1, we will: (1) Demonstrate BioStacks, an extensible, cloud-based text-mining framework that produces knowledge graphs grounded in the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBOs). This BioStacks demo will include a state-of-the-art OBO concept recognizer for multiple ontologies, a state-of-the-art semantic relationship prediction tool, and a state-of-the-art structural analysis tool. All generated assertions will have provenance metadata linking the assertion to a particular text span in a document specified by PMCID. (2) Demonstrate CRAFTST, a cloud-based text-mining evaluation system that evaluates the performance of text-mining systems against the CRAFT gold standard. (3) Demonstrate an adaptive machine learning process illustrating how to efficiently create tools to extract BioLink association types. For Segment 2, we propose to extend the text-mining and evaluation frameworks to align with BioLink and the Translator community, improve text-mining quality and expand the collection of source documents mined. Specifically, we propose to target 10 long term milestones: (1) Align CRAFT to BioLink. (2) Develop new tools for extracting associations from text. (3) Develop and manage a community engagement process on text-mining for Translator. (4) Extend benchmarking. (5) Improve recall. (6) Improve precision. (7) Improve computational efficiency. (8) Expand BioStacks to include all available full text biomedical journal articles. (9) Expand document collections to include Patents & Regulatory filings. (10) Develop a scientist-based movement to improve document access for text-mining from non-open publishers. The types of questions the resulting knowledge graph can be used to address are extremely broad, as it is generated by mining a large part of the biomedical literature. Questions that can be answered include those about specific assertions (e.g. is this drug an agonist-activator of this protein?), general relations (are these two proteins often mentioned together?), and documents (which publications mention this gene, mutation and drug?). Integration: We are long-time contributors to the open-science community and have longstanding collaborations with existing awardees; we were participants in the NIH Data Commons Pilot. We propose to align the output of text-mining tools to the BioLink model via OBO terms. We propose to implement our frameworks in NIH Cloud Computing environments. We propose to adopt the CD2H Contributor Attribution Model to foreground community contributions. We plan to coordinate with the NLM’s nascent benchmarking activities and the SmartAPI effort to build Translator standard interfaces. Challenges and gaps: High-performance mining of rich, contextualized knowledge from the literature remains a difficult task, and is unlikely to be solved in the next five years. Many important publications remain inaccessible to text-mining due to restrictive licensing.

"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,10221055,R01LM013325,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Methods ', ' Morality ', ' mortality ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Patient Rights ', ' Physicians ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Right to Treatments ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Societies ', ' Theoretical Studies ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Shortness of Breath ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' Drops ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' clinical practice ', ' network architecture ', ' health data ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' support tools ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical decision support ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' clinical database ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,232216,MI-12
"Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Project Summary  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) are morbid immunologic reactions to drugs that confer a mortality of 10-50%. Over the last decade, significant promise for prediction and prevention has come from the discovery that many SCARs are associated with variation within HLA class I alleles. For HLA-B*15:02, this has led to routine pre-prescription screening for carbamazepine in many Southeast Asian countries and a significant reduction in cases of carbamazepine SJS/TEN. Despite this progress, there is little known about genetic and epidemiological risk factors for SCARs related to commonly used drugs such as antibiotics. There is also limited information about HLA risk for SCARs across the diverse populations present in the United States. Furthermore, imprecision of clinical phenotyping and lack of standardized coding has led to challenges in finding SCAR cases in the electronic health record (EHR). Our proposed study aims to address critical challenges and gaps in our knowledge of antibiotic SCARs.  In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal EHR data for over 11 million patients from Partners HealthCare System since the 1980s to identify SCAR cases. We will create, optimize and standardize reproducible methods for finding SCAR cases and validating a cohort of SCAR patients. This iterative process will be used to refine and disseminate an electronic phenotype to be validated cross-institutionally.  In Aim 2, we will analyze SCAR prevalence and conduct a case-control study to identify drug-specific and patient-specific risk factors for antibiotic-associated SCARs. We will compare clinical sequelae, quality of life and adherence of SCAR patients compared to controls through validated survey instruments.  In Aim 3, we will identify candidate HLA and genetic associations from patients with validated antibiotic- associated SCARs. We will examine difference in genetic risk in minority and health disparity populations and predict that we will be powered to establish HLA associations for vancomycin DRESS (i.e., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and sulfonamide antimicrobial and beta-lactam SCAR. HLA alone, or in combination with clinical risk factors, can lead to improved SCAR prevention and early diagnosis. We will establish a data sharing platform, in the form of an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.  The roadmap we develop will translate into the development of electronic phenotypes for serious adverse drug reactions that facilitate genetic discovery. Knowledge gained will be crucial to the translation of genetic data into clinical decision making. This is in close alignment with NIH’s research mission to accelerate genetic discovery for iatrogenic and preventable drug-induced diseases that will translate into prevention, earlier diagnosis and an enhanced mechanistic understanding that may lead to targeted therapeutic approaches. Narrative  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) result in substantial morbidity, long term disability, health care burden and a mortality of 10-50%. To advance the science of clinical and genetic risk factor identification for antibiotic SCAR, we will leverage large electronic health record (EHR) data and advanced informatics technology. Through case validation we will create an informatics roadmap for other institutions with similar EHR data to identify SCAR cases and we will establish a data sharing platform, including an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.",Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions,10228607,R01AI150295,"['Tegretol ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dermatology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Administration Routes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eosinophilia ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis ', "" Lyell's Syndrome "", ' Nonstaphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Histocompatibility Antigens Class I ', ' Class I Antigens ', ' Class I Major Histocompatibility Antigens ', ' Complex Class 1 ', ' MHC Class I Molecule ', ' MHC Class I Protein ', ' MHC class I antigen ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Class 1 ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Mission ', ' Monobactams ', ' Lactam Antibiotics ', ' Monobactam Antibiotics ', ' Monocyclic beta-Lactams ', ' beta lactam antibiotic ', ' Morbidity -

"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination.

"Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models PROJECT SUMMARY  Racial-ethnic minorities (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals experience high levels of psychological distress. Psychological treatments can be effective in addressing mental health concerns, but disparities in quality of care still exist. Although systemic and institutional factors contribute to disparities in care, mental health providers are also critical to examine. A primary focus of efforts to understand and reduce provider contributions to mental health care disparities has been to examine cultural competency (CC), which involves a provider’s ability to navigate the cultural aspects of clinical interactions. Patient ratings of CC are generally associated with treatment outcomes and therapeutic processes. While patient perceptions of provider CC are important, a reliance on retrospective patient ratings limits what we know about how cultural identities are discussed, and the language that constitutes culturally sensitive care. Many studies of provider CC also require observers or patients to make complex judgments based on internal provider characteristics that are not reliably observable (e.g. rate provider awareness of their own cultural values). More studies are needed that examine patient-provider interactions in treatment in order to assess the impact of specific provider behaviors, and how they relate to perceptions of provider CC. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been applied to psychotherapy conversations to automatically capture the use of evidence based treatments, topics of conversation, empathy, and emotional expression. Prior research demonstrating the feasibility of automatically identifying topics of conversation in psychotherapy suggest that NLP models could be trained to automatically identify specific moments in sessions where patients and providers are talking about cultural issues. NLP models could allow researchers to not only examine how specific patterns of provider-patient interactions drive CC, but might also provide rapid feedback to providers, and in turn help address disparities in care. The purpose of the current study is to do the foundational work to develop and evaluate NLP tools that capture the cultural content of provider-patient interactions among REM and LGBTQ patients. First, utilizing 32,436 labeled talk turns from 200 psychotherapy sessions we will evaluate the accuracy of NLP models in recognizing the discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy. Second, we will use NLP models to explore differences in the content of 1,235 psychotherapy sessions that were rated as highly positive or negative on a measure of cultural competence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although disparities in the quality of mental health treatment for racial-ethnic minority (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) patients are well known, to date there are no tools that can identify specific patterns of provider-patient interactions that drive disparities in care. This project will evaluate the ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to recognize discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy among REM and LGBTQ patients, and explore differences in patient-provider interactions with low and high patient ratings of provider cultural competency.",Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models,10126722,F31MD014941,"['Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Client ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Empathy ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' culturally competent ', ' cultural competence ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' commercial application ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' sexual identity ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bi-sexual Transgender Queer ', ' provider behavior ', ' clinician behavior ', ' physician behavior ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F31,2021,46036,UT-02
"Biomedical Informatics Tools for Applied Perioperative Physiology Project Summary / Abstract Even though US hospitals have widely adopted electronic health record (EHR) documentation of patient care, interoperability of these systems remains an issue, leading to challenges in data integration. In the operating room (OR) setting, during surgery, physiological waveforms (arterial pressure, EKG, SpO2, central venous pressure, etc.) represent a large source of information used by clinical monitors to extract and display information in order for healthcare providers to make clinical decisions. Integration and synchronization of high-quality EHR and physiological waveform data in large datasets of surgical patients would allow machine learning and deep learning approaches to plumb these datasets for clinically relevant signatures that would promote advanced OR patient monitoring systems to define present state, predict state trajectory, suggest effective counter measures to minimize patients decompensated states, and define the usefulness and efficacy of new monitoring devices. The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining EHR and high fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. The study will begin with the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular collapse during surgery. This algorithm development will be based on physiological signatures predictive of cardiovascular collapse identified in the animal models of shock. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two separate OR databases containing EHR and physiological waveforms will allow for training and development of monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database. The surgical setting is relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted annually to an Intensive Care Unit, more than 50 million undergo surgery. OR databases are unique in medicine because: 1) Changes occur quickly and the lead-time before an event is compressed; 2) Knowledge of baseline/pre-stress status of surgical patients allows normalization, calibration, and markedly enhances prediction; 3) Continuous and immediate presence of dense skilled acute care practitioners allows faster implementation of complex treatment algorithms in the OR; and 4) Defined stages, procedures, and stressors allow building large common relational database registries. By helping to focus the provider's attention on significant events and changes in the patient's state and by suggesting physiological interpretations of that state, such systems will permit early detection of complex problems and provide guidance on therapeutic interventions improving patient outcomes.

"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"eMERGE IV Northwest: A partnership to evaluate the use of genomic information in the health care of diverse participants Project Abstract eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions. Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation, outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma.

"Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder Abstract  Major depressive disorder contributes substantially to morbidity, mortality, and health care cost. Standard treatments are ineffective for up to a third of patients, so new treatment options are needed along with strategies to make more effective use of existing treatments. However, progress in expanding therapeutic options has been hindered by heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course of depression.  In other disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and dementia, identifying disease subtypes has led to therapeutic discoveries. In major depressive disorder, efforts to identify subtypes based on clinical observation have yielded limited success, primarily because of the lack of availability of adequate cohorts for replication, and because those features most apparent to clinicians may not be the most relevant for differentiating subgroups. Efforts to leverage large electronic health record data sets for subtyping address some of these challenges, but standard approaches may not yield human-interpretable features nor those with value in prediction.  The investigators have developed methods for engineering features that balance utility in prediction with interpretability. Preliminary work by the investigators during a year of R56 support yielding 4 publications demonstrates that this approach indeed yields coherent topics without sacrificing predictive validity; electronic health records contain meaningful data that facilitates identification of interpretable patient subgroups. The present study draws on very large cohorts of individuals with major depression, defined by a validated algorithm, in electronic health records from two health systems. It will first apply methods developed by the investigators to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will then be examined in terms of predictive validity as well as interpretability by clinicians.  The study builds on a productive collaboration between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotyping and clinical investigation, analysis of large-scale longitudinal electronic health records, and development and application of innovative methods in machine learning that yield interpretable models rather than black boxes. Data-driven disease subtyping will facilitate clinically useful risk stratification as well as biological study of mood disorders. Narrative  The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to develop new treatments and make effective use of existing treatments. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records will enable the identification of interpretable disease subgroups, enabling development of more targeted treatment strategies.",Data-driven subtyping in major depressive disorder,10211310,R01MH123804,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endocrine System Diseases ', ' Endocrine Diseases ', ' Endocrine Diseases and Manifestations ', ' endocrine disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Supervision ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' therapy resistant ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' clinical investigation ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,832192,MA-08
"TRiPOD: Toward Reusable Phenotypes in Observational Data for AD/ADRD - managing definitions and correcting bias Project Summary Large observational data such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical claims have become an enabling source for facilitating clinical and translational research including Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). One major challenge for conducting observational AD/ADRD studies is about phenotyping – there is a lack of a centralized repository for hosting and standardizing phenotype definitions in AD/ADRD research and few methods have been developed to address bias associated with phenotyping errors in observation data. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to fully develop a joint effort between medical informaticians, statisticians, clinicians, and epidemiologists with a focus on building a rigorous set of methods and tools for managing phenotype definitions and for correcting bias in observational data analysis, through modern knowledge engineering and data-driven statistical modeling. To achieve that goal, we propose three specific aims in this study: (1) Aim 1 - Collect, normalize, and share definitions of common phenotypes used in AD/ADRD observational research; (2) Aim 2 - Develop novel algorithms to correct bias associated with phenotyping errors when users apply existing phenotype definitions to local data; and (3) Aim 3 - Validate, refine, and disseminate proposed methods and tools by demonstration studies and community engagement. We believe informatics methods and tools proposed here will improve current practice on phenotypic data management and analysis, thus enhancing the reproducibility and quality of observational studies on AD/ADRD. Project Narrative Observational data, including electronic health records (EHR) and claims data, provide tremendous opportunities for clinical and translational research for Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). A key challenge is observational AD/ADRD research is to better manage and analyze phenotypic data.

"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10266775,R61AG069770,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patient Care Planning ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Printing ', ' Private Sector ', ' Public Sector ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Prevalence ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' support tools ', ' Theory of Change ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical decision support ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2021,581392,MN-03
"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",10268162,R18HS026886,[''],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2021,444010,UT-02
"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations. Project Narrative In this study, we propose a continuous improvement cycle to develop, manage, and evaluate outcome-driven order sets, a type of clinical decision support (CDS) for computerized provider order entry (CPOE). Mentorship and training include advanced statistics, machine learning, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics. The proposed research will leverage the principal investigator (PI)'s background in methodology development and health information systems to provide the PI with additional training to innovate outcome-driven CDS for CPOE.","Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation",10242838,K01LM013257,"['Algorithms ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Information Management ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Management Information Systems ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Activity ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Clinical Pathways ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' success ', ' research facility ', ' cohort ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' novel ', ' Health Information System ', ' research study ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Research Training ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' computerized ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computerized physician order entry ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' demographics ', ' evidence base ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' social health determinants ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' clinical decision support ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' random forest ', ' long short term memory ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' multilayer perceptron ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' implementation study ', ' ']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2021,176379,NY-12
"Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events The frequency of diagnostic errors in emergency departments (ED) is largely unknown but likely to be significant. There is a compelling need to create measurement methods that provide diagnostic safety data to clinicians and leaders who in turn can act upon these data to prevent diagnostic harm. Electronic trigger (e- trigger) tools mine vast amounts of clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events and have demonstrated capability to identify diagnostic errors. Such tools are more efficient and effective than other methods and can reduce the number of records requiring human review to those at highest risk of harm.  In prior work, we used rules-based e-trigger algorithms to identify patterns of care suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses in primary care and inpatient settings. For instance, a clinic visit followed several days later by an unplanned hospitalization could be indicative of potential problems with the diagnostic process at the clinic visit. We also proposed a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, to enable health care organizations (HCOs) to develop and implement e-trigger tools to measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Review and analysis of these cases can uncover safety concerns and provide information on diagnostic process breakdowns and related contributory factors, which in turn could generate learning and feedback for improvement purposes.  Sophisticated techniques from machine learning (ML) and data science could help inform ‘second generation’ e-trigger algorithms that better identify diagnostic errors and/or harm than rules-based e-triggers that require substantial manual effort and chart reviews. In contrast to rules-based systems, ML techniques could help learn from examples and accurately retrieve charts with diagnostic error without the need for “hand crafting” of an e-trigger. We will apply e-triggers to comprehensive EHRs that contain longitudinal patient care data (progress notes, tests, referrals) that provide an extensive picture of patients’ diagnostic journeys. Using national VA data, including data from 9 million veterans, and data from Geisinger health system, a pioneer HCO that serves approximately 3 million patients, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 – To develop, refine, test, and apply Safer Dx e-triggers to enable detection, measurement, and learning from diagnostic errors in diverse emergency department (ED) settings. We will calculate the frequency of diagnostic errors in the ED based on these e-triggers and describe the burden of preventable diagnostic harm. Aim 2 - To explore machine learning techniques that yield robust, accurate models to predict diagnostic errors using EHR-enriched data derived from expert-labeled patient records containing diagnostic errors (from Aim 1).  To our knowledge this is the first ML application in diagnostic error measurement, which could help scale up expert-driven e-trigger development and refinement. Newly developed e-triggers can be pilot tested and implemented at other HCOs, enabling them to create actionable safety-related insights from digital data. Narrative The process of making a diagnosis in emergency departments can be vulnerable to error. To study the risks involved, we will develop strategies to better identify electronic medical records of patients who may have had a diagnostic error in their care. We will test the use of human-derived rule-based algorithms and data-driven machine learning methods that can more accurately and efficiently identify these medical records than other currently available methods used in measurement of patient safety.",Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events,10254269,R01HS027363,[''],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,500000,TX-09
"Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool Existing methods for surveillance of patient harm in the ED setting are inadequate, without any meaningful change in decades. Trigger tools, popularized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool, have been developed for multiple clinical areas and are used across the world, outperform traditional approaches for surveillance of adverse events. These tools use a two-tiered review process where a nurse screens records for triggers (predefined findings that make the presence of an AE more likely) and reviews records with triggers for AEs, discarding those without triggers. We developed a consensus-based ED trigger tool (EDTT) using a multicenter, transdisciplinary modified Delphi approach, subsequently pilot testing this in a multicenter fashion with encouraging results. This was followed by a recently completed, AHRQ-funded single center study to automate, refine and validate this tool. This study demonstrated that the EDTT is a high-yield and efficient instrument for identifying adverse events in the ED. The present study will evaluate the refined, automated EDTT), in a multicenter study. We will evaluate the EDTT’s generalizability and robustness at three sites with large emergency departments, with a planned in-depth review of 9,000 ED admissions. We will use natural language processing of electronic medical record narratives and machine learning to improve the EDTT efficiency in trigger detection and AE discovery. We will establish the basis for a wider use and prepare for scalability and usability of the tool, creating standardized, streamlined and free online training materials, and by evaluating the tool in a real-world manner consistent with intended use. Project Narrative Commonly used approaches in Emergency Departments to detect adverse events are low yield and have not changed in decades, providing inadequate surveillance for patient harm. The need for improved methodology is critical, given the evolving role of the emergency department in the health care system. Trigger tools, developed for use in many healthcare settings across the world, detect all-cause harm, helping direct resources by identifying areas of risk and allowing an assessment of the effectiveness of quality improvement efforts over time. Trigger tools involve screening of records by a nurse for triggers (findings that make an adverse event more likely) and a review of only records with triggers searching for adverse events. Any events identified undergo confirmatory physician review. We developed a trigger tool for the ED, applying rigorous methods to identify predictive triggers, to computerize the screen for triggers eliminating manual review and improving record selection to enhance yield and efficiency. This tool demonstrates superior performance for detecting adverse events. We will now test this tool in a multicenter project to evaluate its broad application, confirming its utility and to continue to improve its yield and efficiency in adverse event detection by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques.",Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool,10265522,R01HS027811,[''],AHRQ,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,386126,MO-01
"PRECISE - a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr The National Cancer Institute has called for eliminating disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality through the use of Data Science. Gastric cancer remains one of the most unequally distributed cancers in the United States, with high burden among certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups. Identification of individuals at greatest risk for gastric cancer may allow for targeted risk attenuation programs, and improve health equity. Candidate and Career Development Plan: I am a board-certified Gastroenterologist and Master’s degree-trained epidemiologist at Stanford University who seeks to use data science to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes. Based on my training and experience, I have content expertise in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, and methodologic expertise in epidemiologic principles and observational study design. In order to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and national leader in cancer disparities research, I require additional quantitative skills (large data analytics, machine learning-based risk prediction, unstructured data extraction using natural language processing), qualitative skills (effective scientific communication, scientific leadership), and professional development. Research Plan: The overarching research aim of this proposal is to develop a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr (PRECISE) using real-world clinical data sources. My overall hypothesis is that through use of advanced data analytics and deep learning methods, a highly-refined cohort of individuals at highest risk for gastric cancer can be identified. The Specific Aims of this proposal seek to address this hypothesis: (1) to build a personalized risk prediction model using regression, (2) to build a personalized risk prediction model using machine learning algorithms, and (3) to compare regression and machine learning models in electronic health records data. Achievement of these aims will produce a novel, personalized prediction score which will help identify individuals at high risk for gastric cancer and who may benefit from targeted risk attenuation programs. Mentorship Team: To achieve these Aims, I have assembled a world class mentorship team with expertise in epidemiology and health disparities research (Latha Palaniappan, primary mentor), machine learning and natural language processing in EHR data (Tina Hernandez-Boussard, co-mentor), and gastric cancer screening and prevention (Joo Ha Hwang, co-mentor). Environment and Institutional Commitment: Stanford University is a world leader in clinical informatics, epidemiology, and health services research. I will have access to a unique data core, which contains one of the most extensive and robust collections of curated clinical data in the world. My mentorship team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal, and in developing me to become an independent investigator competitive for R-level grants. Gastric cancer is a devastating disease with poor prognosis.

"CICADA: clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug-repositioning of AD/ADRD Project Summary This proposal seeks support for developing advanced clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug-repositioning for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). The proposed project directly addresses the areas of emphasis in PAR-20-156 to “develop computational methods such as artificial intelligence/machine learning to investigate new uses of FDA-approved drugs or candidate drugs from failed Phase II/Phase III clinical trials through analysis of multimodal data.” The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug repositioning of AD/ADRD. Specifically, we will develop statistical methods and ontology technology to extract drug-repositioning signals from multidimensional data (e.g., pharmacy-linked genetic data and biobank data, historical trials, and EHR data). The proposed framework is novel because it integrates advanced statistical inference procedures with semantic technology for data-driven and reproducible drug repositioning for AD/ADRD. We have three aims: We have three specific aims: Aim 1: Develop signal detection methods using multi-modal data (pharmacy-linked genetic data, genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data, and BioBank data). Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of candidate drugs via historical trials and EHR data. Aim 3: Develop novel semantic and natural language processing (NLP) methods for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction. The success of this project will lead to novel computational methods, KG, and software for facilitating drug repositioning for AD/ADRD based on multimodal data. If successful, the proposed method could identify novel drug repositioning signals and generate novel hypotheses for prevention and treatment intervention of treat AD/ADRD. Our project holds the promise of identifying novel drug repositioning signals. This project is novel for integrating evidence synthesis methods with signal detection methods using advanced multimodal modeling, and it is potentially transformative for advancing prevention and treatment for AD/ADRD. Project Narrative In response to PAR-20-156, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop advanced semantic technology and statistical inference procedures for data-driven and reproducible drug- repositioning for AD/ADRD. Our project holds the promise of identifying novel drug repositioning signals and advancing our knowledge on treating AD/ADRD.",CICADA: clinical informatics and computational approaches for
