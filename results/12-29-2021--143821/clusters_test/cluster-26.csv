"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,10146388,R21ES031740,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomass ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Gases ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' North Carolina ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' smoke inhalation ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Inhalation Exposure ', ' experience ', ' genotoxicity ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Toxicogenomics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Chemically Induced Toxicity ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Wildfire ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' public health relevance ', ' in vitro testing ', ' data reduction ', ' biomass smoke ', ' biomass fuel ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' computational toxicology ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,190241,NC-04
"Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal focuses on the challenge of identifying drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease. The foundation of this work is the ReFRAME library, a set of ~13,000 compounds that includes nearly all small molecules that have been FDA-approved, reached clinical development, or undergone significant preclinical profiling. The ReFRAME library is being actively screened against a diverse cross-section of in vitro assays. This proposal pursues three distinct strategies for identifying repositioning candidates among the ReFRAME collection. First, we will create and mine a large and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph. We will use machine learning methods to identify repositioning candidates based on properties of the knowledge graph surrounding and joining each drug and disease. Second, we will mine a massive data set of insurance claims data for associations between drug use and the incidence or severity of Alzheimer’s Disease. Containing almost 7 billion medical claims and over 2 billion pharmacy claims, this data set represents the largest source of claims data available. Third, we will use concept of gene expression complementarity to identify repositioning candidates. We will generate a gene expression signature for every ReFRAME compound in three cell lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease, and we will screen for compounds that produce a signature that appear to reverse gene expression changes seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. After assembling repositioning candidates identified through all three of these methods, we will prioritize up to 100 compounds (or compound combinations) for further characterization and validation. These follow-up experiments will initially investigate the activity of these compounds in five cell-based assays to establish a mechanistic hypothesis on their mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s Disease. Secondary follow-up experiments may include validation in some combination of in vitro (including hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and/or organoids) and in vivo systems. We believe that the multifaceted approach described in this proposal offers the best possible chance at successfully identifying AD repositioning candidates. Moreover, this work will create methods and resources that will be useful to the broader scientific community, both for Alzheimer’s Disease and for other disease areas. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project focuses on discovering new treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. We specifically are looking for drugs that are already approved (or were previously tested) to treat other diseases to see if they can be beneficial for Alzheimer’s Disease patients. We will make and test predictions about which chemical compounds will have benefit, either alone or in combination.","Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity",10137167,R01AG066750,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blue Cross ', ' Blue Shield ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organoids ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Graph ', ' validation studies ', ' Property ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' FDA approved ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' screening ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical development ', ' preclinical development ', ' pre-clinical development ', ' insurance claims ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' ']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,886543,CA-49
"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of

"Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery. While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+ can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins. Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage, calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cell- by-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes, but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response, 30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research. FDA guidelines stipulate that all new drugs be tested for dangerous side-effects on the heart as part of preclinical research; however, the current tests are poorly predictive of both dangerous and safe drugs leading to unwarranted attrition and dangerous drugs reaching clinic. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor tissue (iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) are widely considered to hold great promise for clinical trial in a dish studies of drug cardiotoxicity. This STTR proposal is to commercialize a high throughput platform to accurately identify drug candidates that have cardiac side effects, in particular adding the ability to detect the type of primary heart cell damage common with anti-cancer drugs in a fully automated (high throughput) robotic assay for the first time, to improve the efficiency of preclinical research and the safety of human clinical trials, which will also likely have the added benefit of reducing animal research.","Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical

"An informatics bridge over the valley of death for cancer Phase I trials of drug-combination therapies An informatics bridge over the valley of death for Phase I trials of drug-combination cancer therapies Summary Phase I studies usually focus on drug toxicity and pharmacokinetics, and most (58%) drugs intended as cancer therapies fail these initial trials. Thus, Phase I studies represent the largest valley of death in the course of drug development. Unlike the design of a single-drug Phase I study, the design of a drug-combination study requires prior knowledge of whether either drug changes the other’s drug exposure, the drugs share toxicities, and each drug has an established maximum tolerable dose. Although abundant toxicity and PK data are available in public domain sources, the data are not integrated, and no single database integrates data regarding both toxicity and PK. In addition, data regarding single-drug and drug-combination MTD and DLT are present in the literature but absent from any database. We are confident that a bridge can be built across the Phase I valley of death for cancer multi-drug research and development utilizing an informatics and pharmacometrics approach to take advantage of the abundant toxicity and PK data available for single drugs. In this grant, we propose a translational drug-interaction knowledgebase (TDCKB) that integrates toxicity and PK data. Aim 1 will develop novel active-learning approaches to mine evidence of toxicity and PK regarding drug interactions from the literature. The active learning methodology will employ several innovations, including random negative sampling, stratified active learning by prescreening based on PubMed query, and deep learning with embedding. The final active-learning method is optimized by a thorough integration of these innovative components. Aim 2 will develop a translational drug-interaction knowledgebase (TDCKB) for cancer research. The TDCKB will integrate toxicity and PK evidence for single drugs and drug combinations from various data sources. The evidence of DDI will be classified as either toxicity or PK, and the strength of the evidence will be annotated. Synthesized evidences, such as overlapping toxicity and predicted drug interactions between two drugs, will assist in Phase I drug combination trial design. Quality control will be conducted carefully during both data curation and TDCKB software development. Engagement of TDCKB users and the ITCR community is planned. Narrative Phase I studies usually focus on drug toxicity and drug exposure, which have the largest failure rate, 58%, of cancer drug development, i.e. valley of death. Because of complexity of cancer biology, they usually require multi-drug therapies. In order to overcome the valley of death for multi-drug cancer therapies, we propose an informatics bridge, i.e. a translational drug interaction knowledge base (TDCKB), that will integrate multi-drug exposure and toxicity data from various data sources.

There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of

"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients. UofL is uniquely suited to develop this approach because of the PI’s expertise in breath analysis for detection of Tuberculosis and lung cancer and the team’s experience in virology, infectious

"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was formed after identifying a need for software to assist academics and smaller companies in curating their data and discovery of new hits or lead optimisation. In the past two years the continued importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is apparent from the explosive growth in number of these companies and the increasing number of multi-million dollar deals with pharma using Machine Learning (ML) to assist in drug discovery. There is a heavy focus by these companies on the drug discovery modeling aspect but there is a continued unmet need and bottleneck in the curation of quality in vitro and in vivo data ADME/Tox data for ML as well as prospective testing to validate the technologies. In Phase I, we developed a prototype of Assay CentralÒ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, with ~14 collaborators working on neglected, rare or common disease targets as well as used it for our internal drug discovery projects. In Phase I we also created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed and for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. In Phase II, we have developed Assay CentralÒ into a production tool which is easy to deploy, built on industry standard technologies, provided graphical display of models and information on model applicability. Importantly, we identified that customers wanted us to provide them with the results! We developed our fee-for-service consulting services model using Assay CentralÒ to solve their problems and this has expanded our revenues annually. In Phase II we evaluated additional ML algorithms and molecular descriptors with manually curated datasets as well as compared algorithms across over 5000 auto-curated datasets from ChEMBL. This illustrated the utility of access to multiple algorithms and how the Bayesian algorithm was generally comparable to these other ML algorithms. This also motivated us to develop new software to integrate these algorithms. We have also explored finding rare disease datasets and applying our data curation and ML approach to them. With these and additional collaborations, as well as internal projects on Alzheimer’s disease (through a NIH NIGMS supplement) we have been able to repurpose already approved drugs for several targets for this and other diseases. For multiple projects we have performed several rounds of model building and fed data back into the models to enable improved predictions. Finally, we have developed prototype tools to enable us to develop automated molecule designs, assess their synthesizability and perform retrosynthetic analysis. These combined efforts dramatically increased the number of projects we were able to work on (and ultimately publish to raise our visibility), created new spin off products as collections of models (MegaTransÒ, MegaToxÒ and MegaPredictÒ), molecule related IP, and generated employment. In Phase IIB we now propose a focus on steps to aid commercialization and further development of these technologies. We have identified that developing auto-curation software for dealing with complex biological data in unstructured databases will be a competitive advantage. We have also recognized that for many diseases we can have a complete or near complete collection of targets which may enable us to understand how a molecule may interfere with biological pathways from structure alone and this can be applied to complex diseases and “adverse outcome pathways” in toxicology. We also propose integrating state of the art multi-objective generative models for molecule design into our Assay Central computational software in order to complement our analog generation and retrosynthesis tools created in Phase II and aid in molecule optimization. We will validate this capability using some of the hit molecules identified in Phase II for different targets including human acetylcholinesterase. Assay Central would then have a full suite of integrated capabilities from data curation through to molecule design and retrosynthetic analysis and will enable us to attract larger deals with companies. Narrative In Phase II Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed Assay CentralÒ software, applied it to build thousands of models using public and private drug discovery and ADME/Tox datasets and identified that the Bayesian algorithm performs comparably to other more advanced Machine learning (ML) algorithms. We have applied this modeling approach to rare and common diseases to identify new molecules to test and have identified active molecules through numerous prospective validations, leading to many patents and publications. We have also applied the trademarked Assay CentralÒ technology on consulting projects with pharmaceutical, consumer product and preclinical CRO companies, demonstrating it meets an unmet need and in the process generated revenues. As we have developed software to propose novel compounds for testing, that integrates our machine learning, molecule design and retrosynthesis we now propose extending our auto-curation to unstructured databases, integrating machine learning models for a disease pathway and the addition of multi- objective generative models in order to build out our Assay Central

"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways.

"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10145101,R43NS117234,"['Alleles

"Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks Project Summary  Our lab works in the general area of computational structural biology although it also includes an experimental component. We carry out theoretical and computational research and develop software tools, with our efforts being guided by a variety of applications of biomedical importance. In the past we have elucidated the structural and energetic origins of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, developed methods for protein structure prediction, and detected novel structural and functional relationships between proteins based on their geometric similarity. We currently focus on two distinct areas: the exploitation of structural information to predict protein function on a genome-wide scale and the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition. The former topic is the subject of the current proposal which focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein interaction networks. Our overarching goal is to provide a structure-informed perspective in multiple areas of systems biology, thus filling a major gap in this rapidly growing area of biomedical research.  Our research plans are derived from our development of the PrePPI algorithm and corresponding database of human PPIs. PrePPI provides proteome-wide structure-based predictions of PPIs, and discovers relationships not obtainable from other methods. The P-HIPSTer algorithm, which is derived from PrePPI, offers analogous information for virus-human PPIs for 1000 human-infecting viruses. The reliability of both resources has been validated experimentally, and both have revealed novel biological insights. PrePPI, in common with other PPI databases, is cell-context independent and, for example, does not distinguish among tissue and tumor types. To address this challenge, we developed the OncoSig algorithm that uses machine learning methods to combine PrePPI with regulatory interactions from patient genomic data. The generation of tumor-specific lists of PPIs, called SigSets, can then be mapped onto a context-dependent PPI network, or SigMap. We have also developed novel methodologies that link protein structure space with chemical compound space.  The current proposal builds on these accomplishments with new methodological developments and new applications to network biology. We plan to integrate PrePPI with PPI information derived from genetic interactions derived from the correlation of gene profiles across many conditions (e.g. tumor types, cell lines or drug treatments). This will provide an unprecedented structure- and context-dependent view of protein interaction networks. Other plans include the extension of PrePPI to non-human genomes and the extension of P-HIPSTer to bacterial pathogens. Our overall vision includes the development of an integrated set of software tools and databases that will advance cutting edge biomedical applications. These tools will range in scope from protein- protein interaction networks, structure-derived protein function annotation and to the linking of network biology to chemical compound space which will suggest druggable targets within networks and provide leads for small molecules that can target individual proteins. Project Narrative This project focuses on the modeling and incorporation of protein three-dimensional structures across the human proteome to further our ability to describe disease-related protein-protein interaction networks in tissue- and tumor-specific contexts. These structure-informed networks will reveal mechanistic insights regarding cellular processes underlying human diseases ranging from cancer to those resulting from viral and bacterial infection. Our results will also provide hypotheses regarding drugs that can target proteins in these networks.",Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks,10086553,R35GM139585,"['Algorithms ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' link protein ', ' cartilage link protein ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' structural biology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Protein Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' human disease ', ' tumor ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' druggable target ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R35,2021,405000,NY-13
"A precision medicine approach to improve prediction of severe toxicity in fluorouracil chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My long-term goal is to improve the toxicity profiles for cancer therapeutics. One-third of cancer patients treated with the commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) experience severe and life- threatening toxicity to standard doses of the drug. An appreciable fraction of those patients die—not due to cancer, but because of side-effects related to treatment. Clinical studies indicate that the majority of patients who experience severe toxicity to 5-FU are deficient for an enzyme called dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, DPYD gene); however, only four genetic variants in DPYD have been adequately characterized to be considered predictive of 5-FU toxicity in clinical studies. My preliminary studies demonstrate that these four variants explain only a small fraction of severe 5-FU toxicities and have exceedingly limited clinical value outside of individuals with European ancestry. The primary objective of the studies proposed in this grant application is to identify additional biomarkers of 5-FU toxicity risk that can be used to individualize 5-FU dosing with the goal of improving the safety profile for the drug. My overall hypothesis is that expanded biomarker-based pre-treatment tests will more accurately identify patients with DPD deficiency, as well as the relative degree to which the DPD function is impaired, enabling more accurate dose optimization. My rationale is that improved biomarker-based approaches to dose individualization have strong potential to improve the safety profile for this commonly used therapeutic. Aim #1 will identify risk alleles for severe 5-FU–related toxicity in understudied populations. Aim #2 will characterize multi-marker haplotype contributions to 5-FU toxicity. In Aim #3, I will develop an integrated predictive model of 5-FU toxicity using deep machine learning. It is my expectation that the proposed studies, which will leverage multiple large patient and volunteer data and specimen collections to address various aspects of my primary hypothesis, will answer key questions that have vexed pharmacogenetics researchers for decades. In doing so, the proposed studies are expected to identify clinically relevant biomarkers that can be used to improve the safety profile of 5-FU through dose optimization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improved predictive tests for 5-FU toxicity risk, coupled with a clear indication of the clinical validity of such tests, is relevant to public health because it is expected to reduce the number and severity of adverse drug reactions, improve treatment efficacy, and lower the overall financial burden for cancers treated with 5-FU. Collectively, this is expected to optimize longer-term systemic therapy and minimize toxicity with an overall improvement in quality of life for cancer patients.",A precision medicine approach to improve prediction of severe toxicity in fluorouracil chemotherapy,10295231,R01CA251065,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Fluorouracil ', ' 5-FU ', ' 5-Fluracil ', ' 5FU ', ' Fluoro Uracil ', ' Fluoruracil ', ' Fluouracil ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Incidence ', ' Masks ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Western Europe ', ' Work ', ' Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase ', ' Dihydrothymine Dehydrogenase (NADP) ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Reaction ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' DPYD gene ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' SYS-TX ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' chemotherapy ', ' volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' side effect ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' dose individualization ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,363713,MN-01
"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing.

"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules or cellular features, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. In Phase I of this proposal, we combined the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform. We screened ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes on two cell lines. This dataset was compared to a matching dataset from the pioneering project for D4, the Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. In Phase I, we observed that from both a technical and biological utility standpoint, the metabolomics data provided an orthogonal dataset with signal fidelity, sensitivity, and relevance to compound properties comparable to or exceeding the Connectivity Map. Further, we saw high concordance of plasma metabolite changes in type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis patients with in vitro metabolite changes of related drugs used for those indications. Thus, these results suggest that a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform is not only viable as a complementary dataset to the Connectivity Map, but that metabolomics data can even play a primary role in drug discovery. In this Phase II proposal, we will focus on profiling chemical and genetic perturbations in vitro to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating genetically defined rare diseases. We will expand data generation to ~3300 bioactive compounds across three cell lines. Further, we will profile 50 genetic knockouts on those three cell lines to model in vitro the associated rare diseases. Using Sinopia’s platform, we will select compounds for follow-up evaluation to identify candidates that correct for metabolic dysregulations seen in those rare diseases. Successful in vitro programs will aid in seeding of an early stage discovery pipeline that will be advanced through funding by private investment, patient advocacy groups, and additional federal grants.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of

"Role of Epigenetically Active Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast e1k chemical library (1800 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,10141255,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates ', ' Aldehyde-Lyases ', ' Aldolases ', ' Amines ', ' amine ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Branched-Chain Amino Acids ', ' branched amino acids ', ' branched chain aminoacid ', ' Amino Alcohols ', ' aminoalcohol ', ' Transaminases ', ' Aminotransferases ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' anti-fungal ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' antifungals ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Carbon ', ' chemical synthesis ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Health ', ' Homoserine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Indoles ', ' Industry ', ' Production ', ' Propanolamines ', ' Aminopropanols ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Pyridoxal Phosphate ', ' Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Solvents ', ' Threonine ', ' L-Threonine ', ' Tryptophan Synthase ', ' Tryptophan Synthetase ', ' tryptophan desmolase ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' serine containing aminolipid ', ' Ser-L ', ' serine-containing lipid ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' carboxylate ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Active Sites ', ' analog ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Route ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' thermolability ', ' thermostability ', ' condensation ', ' Physical condensation ', ' 2-amino-1,3-propanediol ', ' serinol ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug production ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' novel lead compound ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,291940,CA-27
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level.

"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"Next generation drugs for bipolar depression and maintenance Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals is developing the next generation of drugs for the treatment of acute bipolar depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans. Existing drug classes are relatively ineffective and very few new modes-of-action have been developed in the past 40+ years. This is due, in part, to the biopharma industry’s focus on drugging single molecular targets, and the lack of predictive animal models for bipolar disorder. To overcome these significant hurdles, Blue Oak’s drug discovery paradigm combines custom-designed privileged chemotypes with a proven deep behavioral profiling method. Successful Phase I studies using this novel, but previously validated, approach resulted in the discovery and optimization of a novel lead compound for the treatment of BPD. The therapeutic utility of drug candidates was confirmed using molecular target profiling, ex vivo imaging of the forebrain circuits implicated in BPD and predictive translational medicine biomarkers. Phase II studies are focused on advancing the lead compound through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, the necessary next step for FDA review and approval of human studies. Aims include: (1) quantification of the preclinical therapeutic (safety) margin for the lead, or superior back-up molecule, including analyses of antidepressant activity; (2) confirmation of an enhanced EEG gamma band as a reliable translational biomarker of BPD drug activity and efficacy in non-human primates; (3) manufacture and qualification of cGLP drug product suitable for IND-enabling studies; and (4) completion of preclinical studies necessary for an IND filing with the FDA, including standard absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/TOX) preclinical studies and preclinical dose escalation studies necessary prior to first-in-human clinical studies. The successful completion of these aims will result in a Type B meeting to obtain guidance from the FDA and the filing of an IND package. The Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals team includes experienced “drug hunters” with expertise in systems neurobiology, medicinal chemistry and informatics, and advisors with proven track records in drug development and commercialization. The internal team is supported by trusted partners in preclinical research, development and validation of translational medicine biomarkers, clinical site management, and clinical development. If successful, this program will deliver a new drug candidate for bipolar depression that will improve the quality of life of patients and their families. This proposal aims to discover the next generation of drugs for the treatment of acute bipolar depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans and imposes a significant medical, social, and economic burden. Unfortunately, existing drug classes are relatively ineffective for most patients and very few new therapeutic mechanisms have been developed into medications in the past 40+ years. Blue Oak is developing a new class of drugs for BPD that potentially has both rapid-onset and sustained antidepressant efficacy as well as an improved safety profile compared to available drugs.",Next

"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10159864,R01AI148740,"['Affect ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-virals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Capsid ', ' Cations ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Reverse Transcription ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Failure ', ' Virus Assembly ', ' viral assembly ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Viral ', ' chronic HBV infection ', ' chronic hepatitis B virus infection ', ' Chronic Hepatitis B ', ' dimer ', ' intermolecular interaction ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' success ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' DNA Replication ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' protein oligomer ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Outer Coat Protein ', ' Capsid Proteins ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' lead optimization ', ' pathogenic virus ', ' viral pathogen ', ' virus pathogen ', ' viral genomics ', ' virus genomics ', ' ']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,393060,GA-05
"A Preclinical Program for Targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis KasA ABSTRACT  We present herein a grant application focused on the late-stage development of preclinical candidate JSF-3285. Per our recently published research, we have disclosed the genesis of this program that led to the hit compound DG167 and identification of the essential β-keto acyl synthase KasA as its target. Building on this effort, our preliminary data detail the optimization to arrive at JSF-3285 which is efficacious in the acute and chronic models of M. tuberculosis infection in mice at doses as low as 5 mg/kg once-daily oral. This proposal seeks to build on this data by conducting the requisite drug combination and relapse studies to achieve clinical status and begin IND-enabling studies. In addition, we propose a second generation program based on preliminary data consisting of a structurally distinct amide series with promising in vitro efficacy, mouse PK, and X-ray structural data. The grant's second aim will evolve this series, leveraging our extensive X-ray structural data, SAR, and machine learning models, to produce at minimum novel early lead compounds if not compounds equal to or surpassing JSF-3285. The sum total of the two aims, featuring JSF-3285 and second generation candidate/s, will lend a high probability to a KasA inhibitor becoming clinically relevant in the next 5 years. PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT  This proposal will develop a new therapy that will help to cure drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis. It will also have the potential to reduce the length of time need to treat tuberculosis and inhibit new resistance from occurring.

"Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast Phase III chemical library (4700 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable.

"Inverted Spectroscopic Infrared Microscope (ISIM) for High Throughput Multi-Dimensional Cell Assays Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a novel spectroscopic cellular assay that will enable us to measure the real-time intra-cellular response of a cell to various extra-cellular stimuli. The uniqueness of our approach relies on several innovations. We will construct an Inverted Spectral Infrared Microscope (ISIM) based on Fourier- transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and combining it with a novel biosensor based on plasmonic nanostructures (metasurfaces). The biosensor will be integrated with multi-well plates to enable high- throughput. The proposed assay will detect biochemical and morphological changes of the cell, with the emphasis on the reorganization of the cellular membrane and its cytoskeleton. The multi-dimensional nature of the spectroscopic data will enable the application of machine learning techniques and improve its sensitivity in comparison with traditional one-dimensional real-time assays. To our knowledge, this will be the first real-time cellular assay that satisfies all of the four requirements below: (i) high throughput, (ii) multi-dimensionality of the collected time-dependent data, (iii) specific focus on biochemical changes of the cell, and (iv) focus on the changes occurring in close proximity of the cellular membrane. The assay will be validated using very common external stimuli of the cell, such as small-molecule compounds acting on G-protein coupled receptors. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to develop a novel multi-dimensional real-time cell assay. This will be accomplished by constructing an FTIR-based inverted spectral infrared microscope (ISIM) and combining it with a novel biosensor. The biosensor is based on the integration of plasmonic metasurface fabricated on an infrared-transparent glass with multi-well microtiter plates. The proposed geometry will enable high throughput while the metasurface will dramatically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the penetration depth of the infrared light into the cell. These innovations will enable us to quantify the effects of extra-cellular signaling on the excitation of intra-cellular signaling pathways. The multi-dimensional nature of the spectroscopic data will enable the application of machine learning techniques and improve the sensitivity in comparison with traditional one-dimensional real-time assays.",Inverted Spectroscopic Infrared Microscope (ISIM) for High Throughput Multi-Dimensional Cell Assays,10218929,R21GM138947,"['absorption ', ' Cyclic AMP ', "" 3'5'-cyclic ester of AMP "", "" Adenosine Cyclic 3',5'-Monophosphate "", ' Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', "" Adenosine, cyclic 3',5'-(hydrogen phosphate) "", "" adenosine 3'5' monophosphate "", ' cAMP ', ' Adhesions ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cytoskeleton ', ' Cellular Matrix ', ' Cytoskeletal System ', ' intracellular skeleton ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' indexing ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Ligands ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Trypsin ', ' Tripcellim ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' Go Alpha Subunit ', ' G Protein Go ', ' G(o) Protein ', ' Go Subunit G-Protein ', ' Guanine Nucleotide-Binding Protein Go ', ' Inhibitory Go G-Protein ', ' electric impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Label ', ' Microscope ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared ', ' FTIR ', ' FTIR spectroscopy ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Agonist ', ' Fourier Transform ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Dimensions ', ' Side ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' vibration ', ' extracellular ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Surface Plasmon Resonance ', ' light transmission ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Cell Attachment ', ' Cell-Matrix Adhesions ', ' Cell-Matrix Junction ', ' Adhesion Plaques ', ' Cell-Matrix Adherens Junctions ', ' Focal Contacts ', ' Focal Adhesions ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' small molecule ', ' Concentration measurement ', ' nano-structures ', ' Nanostructures ', ' Adherence ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Cytoskeletal Organization ', ' Cytoskeletal Organization Process ', ' Cytoskeletal Reorganization ', ' Cytoskeletal Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Cellular Membrane ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biological systems ', ' plasmonics ', ' Geometry ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' spectroscopic data ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,233752,NY-23
