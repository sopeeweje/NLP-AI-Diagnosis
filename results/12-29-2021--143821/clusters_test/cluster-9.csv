"GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research Project Summary Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them. To move the cancer research agenda forward, the cancer research community needs a way to easily combine the right tools and methods to analyze and visualize all the data relevant to their studies, and reproducibly capture the history of what they have done. These objectives may be especially daunting for cancer biologists who don’t program. The GenePattern computational genomics environment has served cancer investigators since 2004 and was enhanced by GenePattern Notebook, released in 2017. The goal of this proposal is to continue to support, expand, and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem. Through these efforts we will continue to support a diverse community of users at the forefront of cancer research who seek to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease, translate improved methods for patient diagnosis and prognosis to the clinic, and identify new drug targets. Aim 1. Ensure the GenePattern ecosystem continues to keep pace with new and emerging methods and technologies and the changing cancer research environment. To increase the range of methods and approaches available to the GenePattern community, we will provide seamless access to other popular ‘omic analysis packages (Cytoscape, Galaxy, IGV) within GenePattern Notebook, allowing the interleaving of methods from multiple packages within the same executable notebook. We will also provide support for querying and accessing data hosted on selected cancer-relevant data repositories. Aim 2. Continue to author and serve GenePattern notebooks for the cancer research community. We will develop 30-50 new high utility notebooks for the GenePattern-Notebook Workspace, leveraging Aim 1 as required, that provide users with guided, step-by-step execution of their integrative analysis. These will comprise data processing and analysis workflows, including approaches that bridge the gap from discovery to translation. Aim 3. Extend, maintain, and support the GenePattern ecosystem infrastructure. We will continue to support and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem, including enabling hosting on multiple cloud architectures and high- performance compute sites, and enhancing the Notebook user interface with high-value features. Aim 4. Provide outreach, training, and support to our user community. We will engage the cancer research community to continue to address their needs. A Scientific Advisory Board of cancer biologists and physician scientists will review progress and guide our strategy as we proceed. We will continue our high level of support and outreach for GenePattern and its notebook environment, including cancer-focused tutorials and training materials, in-person workshops, conference presentations, webinars, and social media vehicles and our responsive forum. We will fully participate in all of the ITCR program activities. Relevance GenePattern is a popular bioinformatics software ecosystem that puts sophisticated computational methods within the reach of all biomedical researchers to address a variety of problems at the forefront of cancer research, including patient diagnosis and prognosis, identification of new drug targets, and understanding disease mechanisms. We will continue to support and enhance the system by providing interoperable access to additional software tools and data resources from GenePattern Notebook, a beginning-to-end computational electronic lab notebook environment for combining analysis and text. Moreover, we will expand our collection of notebooks that provide cancer investigators with scientist-oriented cancer analysis scenarios and tasks for use in their own studies.",GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research,10164740,U24CA248457,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Industry ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology ', ' Training Support ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Galaxy ', ' Letters ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' skills ', ' outreach ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' social media ', ' webinar ', ' genomic platform ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' data access ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' data resource ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Visualization ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,923435,CA-52
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive reviews and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II,10183329,R44MH119022,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Archives ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diffusion ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Investments ', ' Iowa ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Visual ', ' Licensing ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Funding ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Notification ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' data management ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Documentation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' image archival system ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' image repository ', ' imaging repository ', ' picture archive ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' operation ', ' Data Provenance ', ' dexterity ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' imaging study ', ' deep learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Data Management System ', ' Visualization ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' ']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2021,797476,NY-20
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,10005323,R01EB024058,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Quadriplegia ', ' Quadriplegic ', ' Tetraplegia ', ' tetraplegic ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Robotics ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Shoulder ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Powered wheelchair ', ' Electric wheelchair ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Fostering ', ' Robot ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Performance ', ' empowerment ', ' Devices ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' feeding ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Spinal cord injured survivor ', ' SCI survivor ', ' spinal cord injury survivor ', ' Population ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' n-dimensional ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' arm ', ' body-machine interface ', ' motor recovery ', ' Formulation ', ' robot control ', ' robotic control ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' assistive robot ', ' ']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2021,375190,IL-07
"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Project Summary/Abstract  Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients survive years after oncologic therapy due to increased efficacy of therapy, increased incidences of human papilloma virus related HNC, and decreased numbers of smoking and tobacco related tumors. However, the majority of patients are plagued with long lasting or permanent dry mouth (xerostomia), whose severity, rate of development and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors. However, current prediction models for dry mouth have intrinsic issues which so far have prevented their practical use in clinical care, including missing or incomplete data, co- occurence of multiple symptoms, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of HNC and other spatially-dependent cancers, further symptom dependency on the anatomical location of dose within to organs at risk, namely, salivary glands.  We propose to develop validated, patient-specific models to interpret radiation dose to salivary glands in order to inform individual treatment and care decisions for patients. Our data science approach circumvents limitations in the state of the art by accounting for more complex dose-reponse models of dry mouth, by calibrating for inter-patient variability, and by predicting symptom development and computing clinical action signals for a new patient based on cohorts of similar patients.  The proposed supplement application extends the methodological approach of the parent award by incorporating validation data from an alternative facility, item assessment, and user experience testing of the resultant software model user interface, undertaken within a career development plan designed to enhance and accelerate the capacity of the applicant, who is from a background underrepresented in biomedical sciences, to transition to mentored and independent investigator status, thus enhancing cancer research workforce diversity under this program.

"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications to enable more granular and pervasive measurement, prediction, and provide behavioral interventions offers immense promise in reaching the goal of precision health to maintain the overall health of populations. When applied to devices encountered in our everyday environment, (e.g. personal computers, mobile phones, computer mice, even office furniture such as sit-stand desks), machine learning algorithms can amplify the impact of technology on health improvement by its ability to passively sense stress, and to provide just-in-time behavioral interventions based on contextual data and self-reported user feedback. At the same time, the ethical dimensions of these innovative lines of work – some of which entail fundamental concerns about privacy and autonomy – require careful attention from the scientific community. Most critically, there has been little engagement with the end-users of such technologies as a major stakeholder group who are most affected by these learning systems and tools. This administrative supplement request is premised on the fact that the rationale for and unmet needs targeted in the scope and aims of the parent grant can be even more effectively met (i.e. not changed but enriched) by adding participants with direct exposure and personal experience of interacting with precision health technologies to the last stakeholder group in the parent grant (i.e. patients). By extending the patient group in Aim 1 to include those directly participating in cutting-edge research at the intersection of occupational and precision health research, the Aims and Scope of the parent grant remain unchanged, while the real-world application and impact of the products from the parent grant are substantially enhanced. Our Supplemental proposal incorporates precision health technologies involving behavioral interventions of stress management that use ML into the first Specific Aims of the parent R01. In Supplemental Aim 1, we will use semi-structured interviews and qualitative methods to articulate ethical issues in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in behavioral interventions as part of a precision health methodology, with particular attention to occupational health contexts. Specifically, our methodology elicits a wide range of viewpoints from participants by comparing two distinct types of machine learning applications (i.e. physical versus digital interventions), with two varying degrees of autonomy that users may exercise to accept or reject the AI-recommended interventions. Both of these applications present novel ethical questions regarding the decision-making role of ML/AI algorithms in behavioral health research and practice. This supplementary project leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated as a result of machine learning applications in precision, behavioral, and occupational health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning-based and AI-driven precision behavioral health now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. The failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of end-users as a major stakeholder group will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. An empirical approach to anticipating ethical concerns is needed to provide practitioners, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in precision behavioral health.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10367404,R01TR003505,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Furniture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' Morals ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Privacy ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Occupational ', ' interest ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' authority ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Instruction ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' real world application ', ' parent grant ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Precision Health ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data privacy ', ' digital intervention ', ' digital health ', ' ']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,157426,CA-18
"Multivariable Artificial Pancreas System to Detect and Mitigate the Effects of Unannounced Physical Activities and Acute Psychological Stress IIT Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a viable, functionally integrated multivariable artificial pancreas that will mitigate meal, physical activity and acute psychological stress challenges without any manual inputs to better regulate glucose levels of people with diabetes. The first generation of artificial pancreas (AP) systems, the hybrid closed-loop AP, collects data from continuous glucose monitoring devices and relies on manual user inputs for mitigating the effects of meals and physical activities. Acute psychological stress and many other physical activities besides planned exercise can affect blood glucose levels and cause challenges to maintaining euglycemia for people with type 1 diabetes. Various physical activities and acute psychological stress events affect the metabolism and sensitivity to insulin in different ways. Hence, their types, intensities and durations, and their individual and concurrent presence must be detected in order to determine the optimal insulin administration. The multivariable artificial pancreas approach provides a well-integrated and user-friendly technology with minimal burden on the user and mitigates the effects of unexpected physical activities and acute psychological stress inducements. Additionally, this technology would be safer by reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, compared to APs based exclusively on continuous glucose monitoring device data. Such multivariable AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that uses real-time information from continuous glucose monitoring devices and physiological variables obtained from wearable devices worn in free-living daily life. IIT- Project Narrative The multivariable artificial pancreas provides a well-integrated and user-friendly technology with minimal burden on the user and mitigates the effects of unexpected physical activities and acute psychological stress inducements.

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,10241985,U01CA229437,"['Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Boredom ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Maxim ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' tobacco product use ', ' Tobacco use ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' willingness ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' coping ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' field theory ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' Home ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,614136,MI-12
"SCH: Multidimensional Microfluidic Salivary Sensor with Adversarial Knowledge Distillation for Point-of-Care Assessment of Periodontitis and Comorbidities The goal of this research is to develop a sensor device prototype to rapidly measure an array of diverse salivary biomarkers as input for novel machine learning (ML) methods that can predict periodontitis and monitor periodontal progression. Our long-term goal is to develop a rapid, user-friendly, and low-cost pointof-care (POC) device, for use in either a dentist’s office or at home, that rapidly integrates and analyzes data to support patient management. It addresses the priority area of the Data Science, Computational Biology, and Bioinformatics Program of NIDCR in integrating and analyzing high-volume and diverse data to better understand dental, oral, and craniofacial biology and diseases. According to the CDC, nearly 50% adults have some form of periodontal disease. Perioodontitis is silently progressive and patients often seek professional care only in an advanced stage where advanced, painful and costly procedures are needed to control disease or replace lost teeth. Early detection of periodontal disease at an individual patient level is required and there is growing awareness that multiple biomarkers are valued in predicting risk of disease in individuals. We hypothesize that predictive models can be established based on the measurements of a large set of periodontitis-associated biomarkers in saliva; a sensor device that integrates multi-sensor modalities and the machine learning (ML) models will advance the clinical goal of early diagnosis of periodontitis to enable earlier clinical interventions. Thus, we will develop and apply three distinctive sensor modalities for detecting concentrations of salivary analytes relevant to various stages of periodontal progression, i.e., inflammation, soft tissue destruction or bone destruction (Aim 1). Data from both sensor outputs and clinical examination will be used to train ML models via a novel multi-modal adversarial knowledge distillation ML framework, which promotes accurate early prediction with partial longitudinal data representations (Aim 2). The multi-sensor modalities and the ML models will be embedded in a single microfluidic device, incorporating steps such as sampling, detection, and data analysis as an integrated lab-on-a-chip, and permitting the sensor data preprocessed to transmit only the actionable information to the outside platform to protect the user's privacy (Aim 3). Such a device is anticipated to offer for unobtrusive, accurate, and frequent saliva-based self-monitoring, and provide detailed medical data to support clinical decisions. It will be an effective tool for future personalized medicine and dramatically improve patients' oral health. The primary objective of the proposed project is to develop a saliva-based biosensor by integrating research advances in sensing elements, machine learning, data analysis, microfluidics and communications for periodontal disease prediction which has high public health relevance. We will establish predictive models for periodontitis based on data from both sensor and patient. The new device will be useful for saliva-based self-monitoring for periodontitis and other oral or systemic diseases to improve the patient's overall health.",SCH: Multidimensional Microfluidic Salivary Sensor with Adversarial Knowledge Distillation for Point-of-Care Assessment of Periodontitis and Comorbidities,10438075,R01DE031832,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communication ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' Parodontosis ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Research ', ' Saliva ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Students ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Tooth ', ' teeth ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' soft tissue ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' System ', ' empowered ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' solid state ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' miniaturize ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Lab On a Chip ', ' Lab-On-A-Chips ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' microfluidic chip ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' Output ', ' oral care ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Secure ', ' signal processing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' inflammatory bone loss ', ' liquid biopsy ', ' procedure cost ', ' procedural costs ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep learning ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDCR,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,299999,IL-01
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co- occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self- regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than 33% of American adults while weight loss regimens rely on self- monitoring that many people struggle with. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing.,10406434,K25DK113242,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appetitive Behavior ', ' Searching Behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Family ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neck ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Wrist ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' obesity prevention ', ' prevent obesity ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Food Access ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' evidence base ', ' heart rate variability ', ' emotional eating ', ' emotional eater ', ' Regimen ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' adult obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2021,53790,IL-07
"HEALing LB3P: Profiling Biomechanical, Biological and Behavioral phenotypes Project Summary Identifying the optimal treatment for chronic low back pain (CLBP), the most prevalent of painful musculoskeletal disorders, on a patient-specific basis is an important and unresolved challenge. Tailoring interventions according to patient movement characteristics may improve clinical outcomes. Multi-modal studies are underway to characterize CLBP patients and to provide insight into the phenotypes associated with the experience of CLBP in relation to direct targeted and improved treatments. Comprehensive assessment of lumbar spine movement CLBP patients may be an important facet of such treatments such that patient-specific spine biomechanics may be included in predictive models to improve the ability to characterize them. To that end, the purpose of this administrative supplement is to explore additional clinical tools for characterizing lumbopelvic kinematics during functional tasks and daily activities. Specifically, this work aims to develop computer vision methods with which to characterize motions of the lumbar spine, thereby providing an accurate and unobtrusive clinical tool that can be used to supplement or replace currently considered tools such as wearable sensors, handheld sensors, and complex marker-based motion capture systems. This project will use video, marker-based 3D video motion capture data, and wearable inertial measurement data to create and validate single-camera computer-vision algorithms that can be used to compute known clinical metrics. During clinical assessments of patients in the Pitt LB3P Biomechanics Core study, participants are asked to perform functional tasks (e.g., repeated flexion/extension, axial rotation, lateral bending, lifting, chair rises) while wearing inertial measurement units (IMUs) attached to the upper back at T1, low back at L1 and L5, and thigh. The functional performance exams are also recorded by video. The standard metrics determined from these trials will include maximum and minimum lumbar spine and hip ROM, angular velocity at mid-excursion, maximum rotation acceleration, and phase angles for lumbar and hip joint rotation. The goal of this supplemental proposal is to use collected data to develop and train computer vision algorithms (so-called markerless motion capture) to quantify the metrics of interest. Use of video is much simpler for clinicians as it avoids the setup process required by wearable sensors. Recent developments in markerless motion capture have enabled simple camera systems to provide quantitative information about human motions but few studies have assessed computer vision for use in the clinical setting. The research plan in this proposal involves the use of existing data to train and validate computer vision algorithms, and then to further investigate their use in the clinical setting with single camera video to determine the extent to which video-based markerless motion capture may be clinically useful in the assessment of CLBP patients. Project Narrative Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder with major public health and socioeconomic impacts. A clinical measure that is used to characterize and ultimately prescribe treatment is the extent to which a patient has difficulty executing physical activities, but making reliable quantified measurements of patient motions can be challenging with conventional tools and even with modern motion capture systems. This research will investigate the degree to which a simple camera may be used in conjunction with machine-learning based computer vision algorithms to provide patient motion during physical activities that can be used in the assessment and treatment of CLBP.","HEALing LB3P: Profiling Biomechanical, Biological and Behavioral phenotypes",10415626,U19AR076725,"['Acceleration ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Goals ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Hip Joint ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rotation ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Lifting ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Participant ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' healing ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' pain patient ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U19,2021,134064,PA-18
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features.

"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10229551,R01MH123482,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Arousal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' analog ', ' Exposure to ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' biomarker-driven ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' deep learning ', ' microphone ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,493784,NH-02
"Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee Overview We propose to develop a design space framework and co-design methodology for the development of assistive self-care robot technologies that are informed by the social model of disability. Our model of assistive robots in the domain of self-care considers an individual's social and environmental context, coping processes and other factors that can affect independent functioning. Our design methods utilize embedded sensing to intelligently respond to these con- siderations. We speciﬁcally focus on assistive feeding tasks, proposing a formalism that enables a robotic system to feed a person with upper-extremity disability. Our guiding principle is that human-level interaction is feasible only if the robot itself relies on human-level semantics. We im- plement this principle by relying on data to learn and develop object-dependent control policies and timing models for acquiring and transferring a bite to a user at a proper time. The system's ob- server detects world states and arbitrator invokes different control policies based on these states. The tangible result will be an intelligent assistive feeding robot whose performance can generalize to different activities, adapt to user preferences, and recover from failures. Objectives and Relevance to NIH A design framework for assistive robots would provide for- malisms that let us address the fundamental challenge of designing robots that are responsive to context of use and support assisted self-care in a variety of social settings. We combine method- ologies from human-robot interaction, cognitive science, machine learning, robotics and haptics with user studies and our formalism to address the following research questions: (Q1) Mechanics of Feeding-Control Policies: How can control policies be designed for dexterous non-prehensile manipu- lation of deformable objects such as food? (Q2) Social Aspects of Feeding-Bite Timing: How should an assistive feeding robot decide the right timing for feeding a user? (Q3) Human-in-the-Loop: How can human-directed feedback be added into the loop for an autonomous assistive feeding system?  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks. This can in turn help them increase their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. While we presently focus on this spe- ciﬁc application, the tools and insights we gain can generalize to the ﬁelds of robotic assistance and human-robot interaction across other activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Thus, our work is clearly motivated by the intent to improve the quality of health and life of the aging population and is very relevant to the theme of NIH. 1 Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks, potentially increasing their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. The long-term promise of this research is to have robots in society that are able to seamlessly and ﬂuently perform complex manipulation tasks in dynamic human environments in real homes which could impact individuals with other disabilities as well as able-bodied individuals. Through improved access to independent living and customizing to the unique needs and preferences of users, the results of this project can positively impact mil- lions of people worldwide, especially given the vast variability in our target population by being transformational in the scalability of assistive robotics for self-care. 1",Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities,10232054,F32HD101192,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Bite ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Independent Living ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Panthera leo ', ' Lions ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Upper arm ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' social model ', ' intergenerational ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' feeding ', ' robot assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' haptics ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' human-robot interaction ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' robotic system ', ' assistive robot ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2021,68562,WA-07
"Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior – factors that most dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldn’t it be easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.  In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine interfaces – devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human- machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a paradigm shift from today’s simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.  To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including: (1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud- based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class of interactive, human therapeutic devices. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary, new generation of implantable neurodevices that will communicate with, learn from, and teach their human hosts to better treat disease. Current implantable devices are blind to human actions, thoughts and behavior, which limits their effectiveness. State of the art computer techniques that can measure behavior and link them to brain activity will empower patients to teach, control and learn from their devices to improve health and quality of life.","Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior",10267167,DP1NS122038,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurology ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' next generation ', ' brain computer interface ', ' brain machine interface ', ' blind ', ' Coupling ', ' Implant ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' cloud based ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' learning algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,DP1,2021,1137500,PA-03
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the

"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"Oklahoma Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging A Data Science Workshop (DSW) hosted at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) originated as a small gathering of local scientific computing specialists to share techniques and methods. However, as high-throughput data generation and AI/ML have gained prominence, there has been greatly increased demand from non-specialists, including PIs, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students whose work mostly entails bench biology, for introductory and intermediate training in all aspects of data acquisition, storage, and analysis. They are generally computer-savvy already and able to program to some degree, and their interest is in short, hands-on demonstrations of how to apply AI/ML methods to data either generated or accessible via their research. The interest in data science classes is growing at OUHSC, but this need is still not met. Currently, the DSW is a volunteer effort, and the nascent OUHSC data science curriculum has minimal instruction on how to make data AI/ML ready or how to follow FAIR principles. This supplement will enable us to develop material on these topics and promulgate it via workshops, coursework, and freely accessible online content. Importantly, it will allow us to reach a much broader audience. Our recently formed Data Science Workshop (DSW) focuses on developing analysis capabilities in machine learning methods.

"GeneRAlizable Sepsis Phenotyping (GRASP) using Electronic Health Records and Continuous Monitoring Sensors Abstract Sepsis, a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by whole-body inflammation caused by the body's response to an infection, is the most expensive and deadly condition treated in hospitals, with over 270,000 cases of sepsis-related deaths in the U.S. alone. Untreated sepsis may result in dilated and leaky blood vessels and severe hypotension requiring vasoactive medications (aka septic shock), and eventual injury to kidneys, lungs, and liver (aka organ injury) with mortality rates in excess of 40%. Successful prevention and management of sepsis, septic shock, and organ injury rely on the ability of clinicians to anticipate and estimate the risk, and administer the right life-saving treatments (e.g., antibiotics, fluids and vasopressors) at the right time. In recent years, data-driven modeling has been shown to enable early prediction of sepsis and to reveal clusters (or phenotypes) of sepsis, which may help with personalizing therapeutic interventions. However, crossing the translational chasm between clinical research and improving patient care also requires addressing 1) `data deserts' at different levels of care through better data integration, smarter lab ordering, and utilization of continuous monitoring wearable sensors; 2) interoperability and portability of clinical data and analytics; 3) principled dissemination and implementation studies; and 4) education of the next generation of caregivers to effectively utilize advanced analytical tools. The proposed research program builds upon PI's K01 early career development award focused on multicenter development and validation of sepsis predictive analytic algorithms (including hourly EHR data spanning ED and inpatient encounters from over 500,000 hospitalized patients across five district healthcare systems). Drawing insights from recent advances in domain adaptation and multi-task learning (sub-fields of machine learning), this project aims to discover generalizable dynamic phenotypes that are directly relevant to the prediction and management of sepsis, septic shock, and downstream organ injury. We propose to augment EHR-based analytics with high-resolution data from bedside devices (e.g., monitors, ventilators, dialysis, and IV pumps) and wearables (e.g., continuous blood pressure and lactate sensors) to address existing gaps in monitoring. Additionally, this program aims at advancing FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) interoperability standards through the implementation of specific resources for high-resolution data sources. Finally, this research program will be conducted in close collaboration with our dissemination and implementation and hospital quality improvement teams to ensure early assessment of usability, barriers to implementation, and effective education to maximize the potential for clinical impact. Project Narrative The proposed project is making use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and computers to collect and analyze data from hospitalized patients with sepsis. We plan to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for deterioration and which treatments they may benefit. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the care of hospitalized patients with sepsis.",GeneRAlizable Sepsis Phenotyping (GRASP) using Electronic Health Records and Continuous Monitoring Sensors,10277331,R35GM143121,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inpatients ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Vasoconstrictor Agents ', ' Vasoactive Agonists ', ' Vasoconstrictor Drugs ', ' Vasoconstrictors ', ' Vasopressor Agents ', ' vasopressor ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Ventilator ', ' Caring ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' data integration ', ' next generation ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' analytical tool ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' personalized therapeutic ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Internet of Things ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' advanced analytics ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' Dissemination and Implementation ', ' implementation study ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2021,395000,CA-52
"EAT: A Reliable Eating Assessment Technology for Free-living Individuals. Project Summary/Abstract Overeating and unhealthy eating are often associated with various health risk conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure, and some chronic diseases. To get a better understanding of overeating and unhealthy eating, researchers often rely on self-reports provided by individuals. Suggestions regarding changing lifestyle is often provided based on observations from these self-reports. However, it is well known that self-reports can be erroneous and subject to reporting biases. Thus, an objective way to measure the eating activity and validating self-reports is necessary. Recently, there has been growing interest in moving beyond self-reports and monitoring the eating activity automatically. To monitor automatically, and in real time, researchers have looked at using sensor data from wrist worn devices, neck-worn devices, or ear-worn devices to automatically detect eating. These devices often enable capturing the eating periods. However, these devices seldom capture images, thus limiting the possibility of visually confirming the consumed food and their quantity. With the increasing popularity of wearable cameras, it is gradually becoming possible to capture the eating activities and associated context automatically and without any user intervention. Advances in machine learning enables automatically extracting eating related information from these captured images. However, wearable cameras often capture more information than necessary, like capturing bystanders. This unnecessary information capturing reduces participant's willingness to wearing the camera. Currently, no camera exists that can capture the eating activity and at the same time limit capturing unnecessary information. Obfuscating the unnecessary information might increase participant's willingness to wear the camera. However, it is unclear if and which obfuscation technique will increase participant's willingness to don the wearable camera and at the same time ensure automatic context determination. In this project, we will determine the possibility of using machine learning to detect eating in videos and identify the obfuscation technique that can allow detecting the eating activity without collecting unnecessary information. To this end, first we will develop an activity detection algorithm that will allow detecting the eating activity using data from an IR sensor array and RGB images. Next, we will test various obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial and select the best obfuscation method based on the greatest participant acceptability. We will then deploy the eating detection algorithm with the best obfuscation approach on a novel wearable camera that has an infrared sensor array. We will use this camera to test the possibility of detecting eating in a real-world setting. To validate our algorithm, we will ask people to confirm or refute predicted eating and non-eating moments. We will compare the performance of this algorithm against both real-time user response and 24-hour dietary recall to objectively evaluate the algorithm's performance. Our proposed system will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions for behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Monitoring an individual's eating behavior will provide detailed understanding of the causal relationship between the eating activity and conditions such as problematic eating and obesity. Manual self-reports are often erroneous and biased. The availability of wearable video cameras makes it possible to objectively capture the eating activity. However, manually observing video frames to obtain the objective measure of eating is burdensome. Additionally, wearable video cameras pose privacy concerns in real-world settings. To overcome these challenges, we are developing an automated eating detection system to monitor real-time eating behavior via a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals will wear. We will confirm eating activities in real time. Such automatic and privacy-conscious real-time eating detection will allow us to advance our understanding of the eating activity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",EAT: A Reliable Eating Assessment Technology for Free-living Individuals.,10280789,R01DK129843,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Bite ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cartoons ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cues ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Ear ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Female ', ' Fishes ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incentives ', ' Crystalline Lens ', ' Eye Lens ', ' Ocular Lens ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Locales ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Neck ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' response ', ' miniaturize ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' food consumption ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' willingness ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' emotional eating ', ' emotional eater ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' preservation ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,701652,IL-07
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure is an important step towards understanding of biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. Although experimental structure determination has been greatly improved, there is still a very large gap between the number of available protein sequences and that of solved protein structures, which can only be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing sequence, structure and functional data and to develop data-driven computational methods and tools for structure and functional prediction. We believe that by developing sophisticated algorithms to extract knowledge from the increasing sequence and structure data, we can model protein sequence-structure relationship very accurately and improve structure and functional prediction greatly. This project has already produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data- driven algorithms and web servers (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for protein structure modeling. This renewal will further develop machine learning (especially deep learning) algorithms for protein structure modeling without good templates. The specific aims are: (1) developing deep learning (DL) algorithms for the prediction of protein contact and distance matrix; (2) developing distance-based algorithms for fast and accurate ab initio folding of proteins without templates; (3) developing DL algorithms for template-based modeling with only weakly similar templates. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure relationship and yield publicly available resources for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing our web servers to study a wide variety of proteins relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure relationship and to predict protein structures. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,10246779,R01GM089753,"['Abbreviations ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Crystallography ', ' Crystallographies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Sequence Homologs ', ' Homologous Sequences ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' protein structure function ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' protein complex ', ' Torsion ', ' Protein Family ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' Geometry ', ' model building ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' web server ', ' ']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2021,321599,IL-01
"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression.

"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,10135813,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration ', ' Beds ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Preschool Child ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motivation ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' stochastic method ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' patient population ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' treatment group ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' lower income families ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' circadian ', ' data complexity ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,298890,NY-13
"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a strong track record of collaboration. 8. Narrative We propose testing Adapt2Quit — an innovative motivational texting “recommender system.” Adapt2Quit enhances tailored motivational messaging systems using machine-learning algorithms to learn from, and adapt to, user feedback (prior and daily message ratings), thereby increasing message personal relevance. Our study will test Adapt2Quit motivational messaging texting with socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) smokers.","Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers”",10146309,R01CA240551,"['Award ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Belief ', ' Computers ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Motivation ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Paper ', ' Self Determination ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' active control ', ' quitline ', ' quit line ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' learning progression ', ' continuous learning ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' rural healthcare ', ' rural health care ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' digital health ', ' smoking-related disease ', ' smoking-related disorder ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,644137,MA-02
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies.

"Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes PROJECT SUMMARY  Ambulatory assessment (AA) techniques (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes, but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink), who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep, mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves. The candidate will develop expertise in these methods and models that will further the development of a research program aimed at developing person specific models of risk for AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The career development plan will develop expertise of the investigator in the collection and analysis of passive mobile sensing data, with an emphasis on the application of machine learning methods. The proposed research study will use passive mobile sensing data in a large ambulatory assessment sample of regular drinkers, to develop models linking passive mobile sensing data with predictors of drinking episodes (such as stress, social context, and impulsiveness) and the drinking episodes themselves.",Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes,10102612,K02AA028832,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Probability ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Stress ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' problem drinking ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' analytical method ', ' sensor ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' meter ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' drinking ', ' drink heavily ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' extreme drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk drinking ', ' at-risk drinking ', ' risky drinking ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' alcohol risk ', ' marijuana user ', ' cannabis user ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' marijuana use ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' data streams ', ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2021,142338,WA-07
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device Safety ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Device Designs ', ' Device Safety ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' systems research ', ' post-market ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' surveillance study ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Injections ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' algorithm development ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996,TN-05
"Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education Project Summary/Abstract Health literacy is vital to achieving and maintaining good health. Several national programs have emphasized this goal and its importance. Text is generally much more efficient and cost-effective for presenting healthcare information on a large scale than interactive tools and videos. Over the past decade, therefore, most medical information has been provided as text, e.g., via printed pamphlets or on websites. We are entering a new era where a new similarly effective mode of information dissemination is becoming increasingly available: audio accessed with mobile devices. Millions of households have and use smart speakers and virtual assistants and they are increasingly used by patients and consumers to gather information. Hospitals also plan to gradually integrate them among their tools. However, there exist few if any guidelines on optimal generation and use of audio. The overall goal of this project is to discover how to support the creation of optimal audio from existing text sources for consumer and patient education. To accomplish this, four aims are proposed. The first aim is to identify audio features that affect information comprehension and retention. Here, features in audio content and style (e.g., word frequency or grammatical complexity) of the underlying information will be tested for impact. In addition, two groups of features specific to the audio medium will be tested: the delivery features (e.g., speed and pauses) as well as meta-features (e.g., speaker characteristics such as gender or accent and bias in listeners). This first aim will rely on large-scale datasets, semi-automatically generated and augmented with user scores for comprehension gathered using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Statistical and machine learning approaches will be used to tease out the best features and combinations. The second aim focuses on discovering how to augment text for audio and finding the optimal combination of text and audio for information comprehension and retention. Different combinations will be tested online with MTurk participants using controlled user studies. The third aim is to update, test and provide the existing online free text editor to generate optimized audio. We will also start dissemination of the tool to potential users including API access to components. The project will conclude with a summative evaluation with representative consumers recruited at a local community health center and further dissemination of preferences, practical obstacles, and best practices for the medical community to help increase health literacy through this new, popular audio medium. If successful, this project will generate best practices for the medical community in using audio as an additional method for bringing healthcare information to the general public; it will provide an online, free tool to generate audio leveraging these best practices and will include API access so that other researchers can easily integrate tool components into their research and tools; and it will provide immediate practical lessons from working with consumers relevant for clinical practice. Project Narrative Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary for achieving and maintaining health. The increased adoption of smart speakers and virtual assistants by consumers and in medical settings has created novel opportunities to educate the population by delivering health information through audio or audio combined with text. Because few (if any) tools exist to improve content and generate optimal audio, we aim to discover supportive and adverse features of audio/text information provision and create a free, online software tool for optimizing health-related text with demonstrated impact on information comprehension and retention.",Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education,10295641,R01LM011975,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arizona ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Work Simplification ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Comprehension ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' Accent ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' real world application ', ' information processing ', ' clinical practice ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' interactive tool ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' recruit ', ' intelligent personal assistant ', ' digital assistant ', ' intelligent assistant ', ' personal digital assistant ', ' virtual assistant ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' clinical encounter ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,257905,AZ-03
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician. This leads to misdiagnosis and increased days of hospitalization and cost. In order to address this, we propose to test, validate and apply a novel optical imaging device in order to provide noninvasive objective assessment of burn wound severity.

"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Clinical Engineering ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Health ', ' Influentials ', ' Iontophoresis ', ' Drug Iontophoresis ', ' iontophoresis therapy ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physiology ', ' Reading ', ' Sodium Chloride ', ' salt ', ' Sweat Glands ', ' sudiferous gland ', ' Technology ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' beta-Hydroxybutyrate ', ' 3 Hydroxybutyrate ', ' β-Hydroxybutyrate ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Individual ', ' dietary supplements ', ' diet supplement ', ' nutritional supplement ', ' Nutritional Support ', ' nutritional care ', ' nutritional therapy ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Nutritional status ', ' Sweat screening test ', ' sweat analysis ', ' Sweat test ', ' Hour ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Nutrient ', ' Study Subject ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Address ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' cystic fibrosis patients ', ' CF patients ', ' individuals with CF ', ' individuals with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with CF ', ' patients with cystic fibrosis ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' operation ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' microsensor ', ' Data Analytics ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' remote patient monitoring ', ' precision nutrition ', ' individualized nutrition ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796,CA-33
"Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Advances in machine learning and low-cost, wearable sensors offer a practical method for understanding, assessing, and intervening for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) in everyday spaces. We propose to create a Behaviorome research program that will create ground-breaking methods for building health-predictive models from wearable sensor data by mapping patterns of behavior using machine learning and pervasive computing technologies. This program will create innovative multidisciplinary ideas to address NIH ADRD Milestone 11.c, Embed wearable technologies/pervasive computing in existing and new clinical research. Our research program builds on a history of interdisciplinary research contributions in areas including human behavior modeling from longitudinal sensor data and design of novel assessment and intervention mechanisms. We propose to design and validate methods for mapping a human behaviorome “in the wild”, automatically assessing cognitive and functional health from behavior markers, scaling technologies through machine learning, linking health and behavior with their influences, and closing the loop with automated interventions. Similarly, our mentoring program builds on experience training students and early- career investigators to become leaders in the field of gerontechnology. We will recruit and train graduate students and early-stage researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to grow an institutional multidisciplinary Behaviorome research program and to establish new research programs that contribute to the targeted Milestone. We will scale the impact of mentoring by establishing a webinar series and creating youtube videos that highlight and explain breakthroughs in the design and application of Behaviorome research. Results of this program will include scripts and templates to construct a behaviorome with resource- limited wearable devices, scale data and models to large diverse populations, integrate data with multiple information sources (e.g., genetics), automate health assessment and intervention, and create understandable explanations of data and models. These will contribute to existing clinical studies such as the clinician-in-the- loop smart home, digital memory notebook, and pervasive computing measures of functional performance. Furthermore, they will lead to new clinical studies that formalize connections between health and its influences, exploration of the impact of ethnicity and the built environment on health, and the design of ADRD interventions for medication adherence, task prompting, and negative interaction de-escalation. The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on detecting and assessing ADRDs within a person's everyday environment using wearable sensing and pervasive computing methods that have not been investigated in prior work. Additionally, the mentoring steps will pave the way for a new generation of researchers to offer improved methods of addressing the need to understand, assess, and intervene for ADRDs in everyday settings, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to build a multidisciplinary research and mentoring program that will design wearable sensing and pervasive computing technologies to improve detection, assessment and intervention for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Built on a foundation of existing research and mentoring collaboration between computer science and neuropsychology, we will design and validate methods to analyze the relationship between ADRDs and behavior.

"Public trust of artificial intelligence in the precision CDS health ecosystem Abstract Artificial intelligence-enhanced Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) is a growing multibillion-dollar industry leveraging a wide range of clinical, genomic, social, geographical, web-based, and wearable device data for improvements in health outcomes broadly circumscribed under the term “precision health.” Powered by Big Data, characterized by volume, velocity, veracity, variety, and value, “big knowledge” in the form of AI-CDS is becoming increasingly ubiquitous (volume), rapidly developing (velocity), available to a wide range of medical fields (variety), based on data from a wide range of sources that reflects the health of individuals and populations (veracity), and focused on lowering costs and promoting better health outcomes (value). Current policy paradigms for CDS, including whether to classify it as a medical device, are not designed for adaptive artificial intelligence technologies. Patients and providers have no reasonable way to discern how these “black box” technologies operate or their accuracy. Innovative policies (e.g. standards in product labeling) that address these concerns are likely to require direct consumer outreach and communications to ensure public trust in the growing AI-CDS field. Indeed, public trust in AI-CDS has been identified as a top priority for the AI- CDS big knowledge ecosystem by the National Academy of Medicine, NIH, FDA, and OMB, among others. Trust is particularly salient given the range of critical ethical and policy considerations related to transparency, privacy, non-maleficence, equity, accountability, and utility of AI-CDS. In Aim 1 of our proposed study, we will measure the public's current trust in AI-CDS for precision health and assess (a) its relationship to the public's expectations and concerns about privacy, equity, non-maleficence, responsibility, and utility and (b) how it may be affected by policies and practices, such as labeling or certification. In Aim 2 we will use deliberative democracy methods and expert interviews, designed to directly inform policy and standards that address perceived risks of AI-CDS and in Aim 3 we propose to develop a product information label that would both increase transparency and accessibility of information about AI-CDS for patients and providers. The continued acceptance and adoption of AI-CDS is predicated on public trust and our proposal provides a research-focused and evidence-based approach to incorporating public participation into emerging national standards. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed project is to address the gap in current research on public perspectives about ethical best practices and the impact of Artificial intelligence-enhanced Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) on the trust of the public. We propose to focus on policy and practice options such as certification, notification, and product labeling related to essential, endemic issues in the AI-CDS ecosystem: transparency, privacy, equity, non- maleficence, accountability, and utility (Aim 1 and Aim 2). For Aim 3, we evaluate key attributes for product labeling and an accompanying multi-dimensional metric of trust reflective of the Food and Drug Administration's system of categorizing software used as a medical device.",Public trust of artificial intelligence in the precision CDS health ecosystem,10092723,R01EB030492,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Certification ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Product Labeling ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Participation ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Vendor ', ' Accountability ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Competence ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Notification ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' British ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' non-maleficence ', ' Nonmaleficence ', ' Melissa ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Apple ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Security ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' point of care ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' public trust ', ' deliberative democracy ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' data sharing ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' individualized oncology ', ' personalized oncology ', ' precision cancer care ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' health data ', ' learning network ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' patient portal ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Precision Health ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,700766,MI-12
"AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a “trial-and-error” approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it aims to better understand neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation in patients with Usher syndrome (USH) – an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness. Results from this study will have a broad impact on the field by 1) establishing how cochlear nerve degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, 2) identifying tests that distinctly evaluate the loss in the spiral ganglion cells vs the loss in the peripheral axon, and 3) yielding an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neural interface in all cochlear implant users. Results from this study will also have a targeted impact on implanted patients with USH by laying the groundwork for developing an effective, evidence-based clinical practice for managing these patients. This project is relevant to the mission of NIH because it seeks fundamental knowledge about the nature of electrical hearing in patients with USH and strives to apply this knowledge to reduce disability in all patients with cochlear implants.",AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME,10192995,R21DC019458,"['Accounting ', ' Action Potentials ', ' Affect ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Cochlear Nerve ', ' Cochlear Root of Acoustic Nerve ', ' Cochlear Root of Eighth Cranial Nerve ', ' Communication ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hearing ', ' Sensorineural Hearing Loss ', ' Sensorineural Deafness ', ' Sensory Hearing Loss ', ' sensorineural hearing impairment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interphase ', ' Maps ', ' Mission ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Retinitis Pigmentosa ', ' Pigmentary Retinopathy ', ' Tapetoretinal Degeneration ', ' rod-cone dystrophy ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' spiral ganglion ', ' Corti ganglion ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Usher Syndrome ', ' Graefe-Usher syndrome ', ' Hallgren syndrome ', "" Usher's syndrome "", ' dystrophia retinae pigmentosa-dysostosis syndrome ', ' dystrophia retinae-dysacousis syndrome ', ' retinitis pigmentosa-congenital deafness syndrome ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Cochlear Implantation ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Cochlear implant procedure ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Auditory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' Location ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Auditory system ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Practice Management ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology -

"Towards a Convenient, Point-of-Care Device for Screening and Surveillance of Aortic Aneurysms PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT An aortic aneurysm carries increasing risk of rupture with growing aneurysm diameter. This condition is typically asymptomatic, so screening and surveillance are essential. Ultrasound and other imaging methods are employed for such monitoring at high accuracy. However, these methods require an expert-operator and are expensive, and aortic aneurysms are considerably underdetected at present and may become even more underdetected in the future as the disease prevalence increases with societal aging. The broad goal is to establish a point-of-care device that is convenient in use and cost (e.g., in a smartphone form factor) for aortic aneurysm screening and surveillance. The underlying hypothesis is that arterial waveforms, which can be obtained with such a device, constitute a non- imaging solution for indicating aneurysm size. This new hypothesis will be efficiently and effectively tested by leveraging a wealth of existing patient data. These data include high-fidelity, non-invasive waveforms from four arterial sites and reference imaging measurements of aneurysm size from at least 217 patients and 217 matchable controls. The specific aims are to develop and validate (1) physics-based methods and (2) machine learning methods for predicting aneurysm size from arterial waveforms. The physics-based methods will fit tube-load models of arterial wave transmission and reflection to the waveforms to estimate parameters indicative of aneurysm size. The machine learning methods will employ linear regression or a neural network and take inputs comprising waveform features such as pulse wave velocity, which decreases with increasing aneurysm diameter as predicted by the well-known Moens-Korteweg equation, and number of local waveform maxima, which may increase with enhanced negative wave reflection induced by aneurysm growth, as well as confounding factors such as blood pressure and age, which also alter pulse wave velocity, to predict aneurysm diameter. These methods will be optimized using a portion of the patient data for application to various combinations of the arterial waveforms (e.g., proximal and distal waveforms or single waveforms). The developed methods will then be tested using the remaining data, while blinded to the reference aneurysm measurements, in terms of their ability to track aneurysm diameter and classify patients versus controls and patients before versus after endovascular repair. The final method will be chosen as the one that best balances accuracy of aneurysm monitoring with convenience of arterial waveform measurements. Successful completion of this project will guide the design and justify the development of a point-of-care device that may ultimately help mitigate aortic aneurysm mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE An aortic aneurysm – a balloon-like bulge in the body’s main blood vessel – is at risk for rupture, which often leads to death. However, taking a picture of inside the body to make a diagnosis requires an expert-operator and is expensive, and the condition is often left undetected. Research will be performed towards technology that is convenient in use and cost for monitoring aortic aneurysms.","Towards a Convenient, Point-of-Care Device for Screening and Surveillance of Aortic Aneurysms",10125246,R21EB029376,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Aneurysm ', ' Aortic Aneurysm ', ' aorta aneurysm ', ' Ballistocardiography ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Palpation ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Veterans ', ' Blinded ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Ruptured Aneurysm ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Measurement ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Elderly man ', ' Equation ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Rupture ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' prospective test ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,410344,PA-18
"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10227769,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms ', ' Laboratory Animals ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Budgets ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Equipment ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Modernization ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Risk ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Manufactured form ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' conditioning ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' nanofabrication ', ' nano fabricate ', ' nano fabrication ', ' nanofabricate ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' neurotechnology ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' safety testing ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' signal processing ', ' trigonometry ', ' trigonometric ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' animal safety ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,871272,MN-05
"The Monarch Initiative: Linking diseases to model organism resources ABSTRACT Biomedical researchers need to identify novel disease genes and understand disease mechanisms; clinicians need to diagnose diseases and optimize treatments. An improved understanding of the genetic basis of disease helps achieve both goals. The Monarch Initiative makes this possible by integrating the fragmented data landscape into the most comprehensive open collection of genotype-phenotype data in the world. Our Knowledge Graph (KG) links together clinical, biomedical, and basic science research data spanning multiple organisms, and supports reasoning across a wide range of organisms, body systems, and diseases. Monarch has achieved demonstrable clinical and translational success using model organism data to perform rare disease diagnosis and gene-to-disease discovery, and our resources have become global standards. In Phase II, we integrated the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) into the UMLS; enhanced our variant prioritization algorithms and Exomiser tool, which was applied to 30,000 patients in the National Health Service (UK); developed the Biolink Model/API; released new ontologies (Mondo unified disease ontology, Unified Phenotype Ontology (uPheno), and the Environmental Conditions and Treatments Ontology (ECTO)), raised the number of harmonized data sources in our KG to 34; and overhauled our web Portal. We will leverage this foundation to make Monarch more intuitive for a diversity of users and contexts in phase III as follows: Augment the Monarch Portal with new visualizations and tools. Guided by user requirements, iterative user testing, and feedback, we propose to enhance the user experience and Portal functionality, focusing our work on improvements to Navigation, Visualization, and Query. Evaluate, optimize, and enhance algorithms for disease diagnostics, cross-species inference, and gene-disease discovery. We will develop a comprehensive, modular evaluation framework, ‘PhEval,’ that will allow us to monitor the diagnostic yield and performance of cross-species inference as our ontologies and data graphs evolve. This will assist basic science researchers and clinicians to reveal cross-species mechanistic evidence and evaluate potential precision disease modeling strategies. Disseminate computational tools, data, services, and tutorials to a broad translational community. We will expand access to our KG to enable users to process the KG for different domains and use cases, through simplified downloads, APIs, software libraries, R packages, Jupyter notebooks, and Dockerized resources, along with training materials. This will better support bioinformaticians and other researchers in leveraging our KG and phenotype data in their analyses. The Monarch Initiative aims to significantly improve the utilization, accessibility, and value of animal models for disease diagnosis and discovery. NARRATIVE To understand disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments, we need to untangle the relationship between genetics and phenotypes of all organisms (such as human, mouse, zebrafish, and fruitfly). Sophisticated comparative information systems are needed to collect, search, and compare the diverse and often mutually incompatible data being generated.

"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null.

"PROTEAN-CR: Proteomics Toolkit for Ensemble Analysis in Cancer Research Project Summary Understanding protein–ligand molecular interactions is fundamental to understanding the role of proteins in complex diseases such as cancer. For instance, there is growing interest in predicting the binding modes of peptide-based ligands (e.g., cyclic and phosphorylated peptides) to inhibit or induce targeted degradation of high-proﬁle cancer targets. Another promising example is the identiﬁcation of tumor-associated antigens for cancer immunotherapy applications. Both examples involve very speciﬁc molecular interactions, provide opportunities for computer-aided design of better cancer treatments, and highlight the need for structural analyses in cancer research. They also require new methods that account for the ﬂexibility and variability of the protein receptors involved in these molecular interactions. The objective of this project is to develop an integrated approach to the structural modeling and analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research that will be implemented in the proteomics toolkit PROTEAN-CR. The proposed toolkit will adopt a data-science approach to the problem by introducing approaches for data acquisition and aggregation, as well as algorithmic advances for handling receptor ﬂexibility and for modeling driver mutations, drug-resistance polymorphisms, and post-translational modiﬁcations. PROTEAN-CR will streamline running structural analyses at scale while providing meaningful data analytics. The long-term goal of our research is to fully integrate three-dimensional structural information about proteins and ligands and structural analysis into cancer research. The PIs will work with collaborators to target a wide range of users, from experimentalists with little to no programming experience, to advanced users who are comfortable scripting large-scale analyses and integrating the toolkit with their own computational pipeline. The central hypothesis is that a uniﬁed data-science-inspired approach can be used to address major challenges in structural analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research at scale. The ﬁrst aim will incorporate protein ﬂexibility in docking studies for cancer research. Speciﬁc workﬂows will be used to generate ensembles of protein conformations (receptor ﬂexibility) and innovative machine learning methods will be implemented aiming at a better scoring of protein–ligand complexes. The second aim will focus on including cancer variability into structural analysis. We aim to ﬁll the gap that exists between available data on cancer variants and the structural analysis of ensembles of tumor-associated mutations and protein modiﬁcations. Finally, the third aim will focus on customization, interpretability and scalability, where user-friendly methods will be deployed to manage ensembles of protein-ligand complexes. PROTEAN-CR will be developed focusing on speciﬁc cancer-related projects, and with a broad network of collaborators, enabling the design, implementation and evolution of the tool according to the needs of the cancer research community. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it employs an innovative data-science approach to make molecular structural analysis accessible to cancer researchers. The toolkit that will implement and harden this approach will be made freely available to advance efforts to discover key mechanisms inherent to cancer, enabling the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics. The proposed software toolkit will integrate data acquisition, computation, analytics and visualization with emphasis on three fronts: (a) ﬂexibility, allowing the sampling of conformations taking into account receptor as well as the ligand dynamics; (b) variability, allowing the user to simulate proteins with cancer-associated mutations and post-translational modiﬁcations; and (c) scalability, giving researchers the opportunity to process and analyze large amounts of structural data, using intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.",PROTEAN-CR: Proteomics Toolkit for Ensemble Analysis in Cancer Research,10188196,U01CA258512,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computers ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Ligands ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Mythology ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Peptides ', ' Cyclic Peptides ', ' Phosphopeptides ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' cancer antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Computer-Aided Design ', ' Computer-Assisted Design ', ' RNA Editing ', ' RNA, Messenger, Editing ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Intuition ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' immune-based cancer therapies ', ' immunotherapy for cancer ', ' immunotherapy of cancer ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Greek ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' vaccine development ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' drug discovery ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Protein Analysis ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Phosphorylated Peptide ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' peptide based vaccine ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' user-friendly ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' screening ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Analytics ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' Cellular immunotherapy ', ' cell-based immunotherapy ', ' immune cell therapy ', ' in silico ', ' Visualization ', ' computational pipelines ', ' driver mutation ', ' driver lesion ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,402077,TX-02
"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Project Narrative Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will develop a new version of existing software so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",10271571,U24EB028990,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Budgets ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Apple ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Operating System ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' NIBIB ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' reduced substance use ', ' reduction in substance use ', ' substance use reduction ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' healthy weight ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' poor diet ', ' SMART health ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' comparison intervention ', ' compare intervention ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,377490,MI-08
"mHealth Tympanometer: A Digital Innovation to Address Preventable Childhood Hearing Loss in Low- and Middle-Income Countries ABSTRACT Hearing loss is the second leading impairment worldwide. Childhood hearing loss has lifelong implications and disproportionately affects individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Up to 75% of childhood hearing loss in LMICs is preventable due to the high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. School hearing screening is critical for identification of childhood hearing loss in low resource settings, where newborn screening is unavailable. However, most screening programs only use pure-tone screening that does not identify middle ear disease widespread in populations with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. This is because tympanometry, used to clinically identify middle ear disease, is expensive and designed for trained professionals. Our goal is to develop and validate an mHealth tympanometer with machine learning diagnostic support to transform this technology into a low-cost tool that could be broadly disseminated in LMICs, where the burden of hearing loss is greatest and is not addressed by current hearing screening methodology. Our study team is comprised of international leaders in hearing loss, audiology, data science, engineering, user- centered design, and device development in LMICs. We have also partnered with hearX, a University of Pretoria spinout company that developed the only validated mHealth pure-tone screening device. To test this new device in an appropriate LMIC setting, we have partnered with the South African site from the Global HEAR Collaborative, our consortium of collaborators from 28 countries that is the only international research network dedicated to hearing loss. We documented the need for this device in a large cluster randomized trial recently completed in rural Alaska, where tympanometry significantly improved the accuracy of school hearing screening in a population with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. Using data from this trial and pilot funding, we are developing a machine learning tympanometry algorithm for lay screeners, and early hardware prototype fabrication is underway. In Aim 1, we will refine the hardware prototype using a user-centered design approach, cyclically incorporating feedback from South African team members during testing in a lab environment. In Aim 2, we will develop software through user-centered design that integrates the machine learning algorithm and refined hardware prototype. The resulting mHealth tympanometer will advance to the R33 phase. Technology development will be completed in Aims 3 and 4 through integration of the mHealth tympanometer with existing health information technology and an early feasibility study in 15 preschool children in South Africa to optimize device design for lay users. In Aim 5, we will validate the mHealth tympanometer with lay screeners through a clinical performance study in 500 preschool children in South Africa. This technology, developed through partnership and testing in an LMIC setting, will empower teachers and community health workers to identify children at risk for preventable hearing loss. The Global HEAR Collaborative will provide infrastructure for future studies with the proposed device across LMICs, directly addressing disparities in childhood hearing loss globally.

"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC

Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10353084,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Care ', ' Elements ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vendor ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' interoperability ', ' encryption ', ' clinical care ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' data access ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2021,40963,MA-05
"ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks We propose an Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation of Ranked Networks (ARAGORN), which will query Knowledge Providers (KPs) and synthesize answers relevant to user-specified questions, building upon algorithms and components developed as part of the ROBOKOP [1,2] application during the feasibility phase of Translator. The ARAGORN services represent the next generation of ROBOKOP component services, iterating and innovating in response to challenges exposed in the Translator feasibility phase. Based on that work, we have identified overarching issues that must be addressed to truly unleash the power of Translator. 1. ARAs must be able to operate in a federated knowledge environment effectively and efficiently. First-generation Translator tools assembled full data sets from which to extract answers, which were subsequently ranked. Second-generation tools must be able to efficiently operate on massive, distributed data, demanding a new approach. ARAGORN will act asynchronously, interleaving KP queries with partial scoring of answers, prioritizing search directions on-the-fly, and delivering early results that are updated over time in response to newly explored paths 2. ARAs must bridge the precision mismatch between data representations and algorithms that require specificity, and users who pose questions and prefer answers at a more abstract level. Biomedical scientists do not pose questions as database queries. Furthermore, even expert users of current biomedical databases such as ROBOKOP KG or RTX require exploration and experimentation to craft queries to express their intent. ARAGORN will employ multiple strategies to remove this barrier to asking questions effectively, from basic maintenance of a question library, to node generalization, query rewriting, and machine learning techniques such as capsule graph networks. ARAGORN will further use elements of specific answers to create gestalt explanations, clustering, and combining answers with similar content, revealing the commonalities and contradictions in answers. 3. ARAs must be able to generalize answer ranking to address a broader range of question formulations and data types, and to account for counterevidence. In the Translator implementation phase, we anticipate having access to many varied KPs and ARAs that provide diverse quantitative metadata regarding the confidence in assertions or strength of associations. There will be a pressing need to synthesize such data into scores for arbitrarily-shaped answer graphs, in order to filter and prioritize answers for further analysis or user digestion. ARAGORN will address this need by providing a novel scoring algorithm capable of (a) scoring arbitrary directed multi-hypergraphs, (b) accounting for heterogeneous quantitative metadata; and (c) leveraging relationship polarity to incorporate counterevidence. ARAGORN will provide access to this functionality, and connect to KPs using community-defined APIs and data models. The ARAGORN team has contributed to these community efforts during the Translator feasibility phase, and if funded will continue to work with the Standards and Reference Implementations (SRI) group, NCATS staff, and other awardees to continue to define and refine methods and models for data sharing and collaboration. The ARAGORN services will be created with collaboration in mind, such that they can be plugged into larger pipelining and architectural efforts. Most of the risks to the ARAGORN strategy are shared by the entire program; as standardization evolves, the ARAGORN team and other members of the Translator consortium will be required to spend effort updating components. ARAGORN will require access to ontology and similarity tools that we anticipate will be provided by KPs or shared infrastructure; if these do not materialize, the ARAGORN team will create the tools that it needs to accomplish its goals. Additionally, we are assuming the existence of fully translator-compliant KPs from which to draw data; if the program collectively decides that compliance is enforced in ARAs instead, we will draw on our work in ROBOKOP to implement the necessary normalization components in ARAGORN.

"Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment PROJECT SUMMARY In this Phase II SBIR project, Parabon NanoLabs will complete the development, validation and commercialization of CTX, a revolutionary smartphone- and tablet-based cognitive testing platform for collection and analysis of measurements of cognitive performance (“phenotypes”). Traditionally, cognitive assessments are performed in a clinic using either simple surveys that assess only some aspects of cognition or expensive, single-purpose equipment such as eye tracking stations. Such testing lacks the frequency and precision needed to detect subtle early changes that signal the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early-symptomatic dementia. Instead, CTX will take full advantage of mobile sensors (e.g., audio, video, touchscreen, and motion) to enable in-depth cognitive testing anytime, anywhere. Regular use of CTX will allow a clearer picture of each user's cognitive abilities to emerge, enabling early detection of subtle changes. CTX is not intended to replace neurologists but instead to extend their reach by allowing regular, widespread screening for improved disease detection and patient monitoring. The long-range goal of CTX is to allow aging adults to monitor and manage their cognitive health more effectively and to provide pre-symptomatic indicators of pending dementia to patients and their clinicians, thus enabling early intervention and planning. After a highly successful Phase I project, CTX already enables rapid development of mobile tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashion and transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and reporting. Sophisticated analytics pipelines have been developed to convert these sensor streams into cognitive phenotypes (e.g., extracting eye movement data from selfie video taken during a cognitive test). Using the CTX framework, the Parabon team has already developed an Apple® iOS® mobile app with proof-of-principle tests for assessing verbal recall, eye movement, motor function, and episodic memory. In Phase II, we propose to develop two new suites of CTX tests for one-time cognitive impairment screening and cognitive performance monitoring, as well as phenotype extraction pipelines for each. We will evaluate tests in normal and affected cohorts to determine usability, user retention and whether resulting phenotypes enable accurate cognitive assessments by clinicians. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop new and engaging cognitive tests and pipelines for assessing visual search and targeting, expressive and receptive language, motor movement and episodic memory; (2) Validate measures in cognitively normal and impaired cohorts; and (3) Analyze and prepare data for publication and premarket submissions to the FDA. PROJECT NARRATIVE According to the World Health Organization, the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple from 50 million to 152 million by 2050. Existing pen-and-paper cognitive tests used for dementia screening were designed to detect overt disease, but early detection of cognitive decline is needed for proper intervention and planning. In this project, we are developing a smartphone- and tablet-based set of highly accurate tests that can be used for one-time cognitive impairment screening and game-like activities for ongoing cognitive health monitoring.",Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment,10255750,R44AG062072,"['Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the

"Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this proposal is to design and validate a Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) device which can non-invasively measure periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment loss based on cementoenamel junction (CEJ) location, gingival biotype and inflammation. Current periodontal evaluation methods are inaccurate because they are based on visual inspection and periodontal probing. While radiography offers detailed information about hard tissues such as bone and teeth, more detailed information about soft tissue is usually missed in radiography. Ultrasound/photoacoustic approach has been used in soft tissue imaging but rarely in dentistry because they have a large size transducer which limits the entire oral cavity scan. This is a fundamental limitation of existing technology. To solve this problem, StyloSonic LLC will construct and validate a miniaturized handpiece with a compact laser diode for ultrasound/photoacoustic imaging to provide key periodontal metrics. PUPI offers real-time, accurate, and repeatable measurements with utility in diagnosis and therapy monitoring. That is the value of this proposal. The workflow will include two parts: Aim 1 will design and fabricate the PUPI prototype and Aim 2 will evaluate the fundamental functionality of the device and confirm the validation in a pilot clinical study in collaboration with Dr. Casey Chen at University of Southern California. 100 teeth (5-10 patients) with moderate periodontitis (pocket depth: 4-6 mm) will be evaluated with PUPI and manual probing method before and 4-week after the nonsurgical treatment (i.e., scaling and root planning). That will give us 80% statistical power assuming an alpha of 0.05 based on our preliminary data. Our goal is to build a handpiece that can easily scan the entire oral cavity. We will test the designed miniaturized handpiece using an oral care manikin. We hypothesize that the correlation coefficient between probing and PUPI is R2 > 0.8. We also hypothesize that the PUPI will show a significant difference in pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, gingival biotype and inflammation before and four weeks after treatment (p <0.05). This approach is innovative because for the first time, the miniaturized handpiece of PUPI will provide anatomical and functional information of the entire gingiva architecture. In addition, PUPI will enable accurate diagnostics and therapy monitoring which add enormous value for recommended treatment and ensure best outcomes. The clinical impact is the proposed device will assist dentists and periodontists to accurately diagnose gingivitis in the early stage and reduce the rate of advanced periodontitis. This work will introduce a non-invasive and non- ionizing dual modality imaging technique which has significant impacts on oral health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dental health is critical to quality of life, but the tools that dentists use for periodontal exams are largely anatomical and inspect the gingiva by eye or periodontal charting. This work will develop and validate a non- invasive Periodontal Ultrasound/Photoacoustic Imaging (PUPI) with a miniaturized handpiece.

"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources.

"Portable Hearing Laboratory  - CRP In the parent Phase II project (R44DC016247; PI: C. Pavlovic) we successfully developed a portable platform for developing and testing new hearing aid technology. This Portable Hearing Laboratory, or PHL, has now been acquired and is being used by a number of leading university laboratories and other research centers and their feedback has been extremely positive. The device features a central unit (BatAndCat Box) which provides an appropriate and complete hearing aid ambient for developing new algorithms. A number of realistic interfaces has also been provided. This includes an extremely high quality BTE system we designed; an ITE system adapted by us, as well as an appropriate interface circuitry for typical wearables (e.g; headsets via the line input). Finally, a smart phone app features interfaces both for the researcher and the subject. The system runs the Master Hearing aid sweet developed concurrently in R01DC015429 (PIs Hohmann and Pavlovic). In this CRP renewal we will achieve the following goals: 1. Implement various Design for Excellence Measures (DFX) and super modern manufacturing  technology to obtain the highest product quality at the lowest product cost. This would make  the product affordable for large clinical studies and, potentially, for some consumer sales. 2. In response to the recent availability of, and the recent research demand for, a far greater  processing power to enable the development of algorithms which rely on machine learning,  we plan to increase the processing power of the device by at least 10 times, and likely 20  times, by changing the processor core to a multicore system. 3. Introduce modern low-latency BLE technology to enable efﬁcient noise reduction by utilizing  remote microphones and machine learning. 4. The other complementary requirement to extract speech from noise is being able to inform  the system whom the listener is actually listening to. This will be achieved by providing on  the PHL the interface means for external multi-sensor arrays such as EEG, OEG, etc. 5. Execute electrical and mechanical design changes dramatically reducing the size and  weight of the device. This would not only be a much more acceptable device for long clinical  trials, but would also open up a direct-to-consumer, secondary market for the device. 6. It is our strong determination to provide continuous support to the Beta sites for extensive  further testing of the device in a variety of settings. We consider this the best means to  reach the perfection.

"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability.

"WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild Project Summary Behavioral interventions for weight loss include self-monitoring and self-report of diet. However, few people adhere to self-monitoring because they believe it will be a burden. For those who do adhere, biased reporting leads to poor accuracy. Self-report measures have helped us understand contextual factors of problematic eating behaviors, but we cannot validate such relationships to dietary intake and weight because of unreliable reporting. Therefore, we need an objective way to validate self-report measures. Automated self-monitoring, however, can lead to high eating false alarm detection rates (calling something eating when it is not eating). It also requires participants to push buttons during the start and end of a meal. Passive and unobtrusive ways to capture images of food intake would improve accuracy of detection, avoid the need for a person to remember what they ate, and limit bias based on what participants believe to be socially desirable. Such methods could also ease the self-monitoring burden, decrease errors associated with self- report measures, and lay the foundation for understanding when and how problematic eating behaviors occur. Image capture using wearable cameras may help us better understand obesity and its context (that is, the situation in which eating occurs). However, privacy and ethical concerns of bystanders whose images are taken are a significant barrier. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that participants are both willing to wear and that provides meaningful information on food intake and context associated with problematic eating behaviors. Several methods exist, known as obfuscation, that can filter unnecessary information in the scene. However, we do not know which method is most acceptable to a person wearing the device in everyday life that would encourage greatest wear-time. Our project aims to determine which method is best for preserving privacy while providing enough information to understand eating behaviors and their context. To do this, we will observe participants in their everyday life, with special attention to eating behaviors. We will use these new image capture techniques to help understand eating behaviors associated with obesity. First, we will select the best obfuscation method by testing the most well-known obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial to identify which method has the greatest participant acceptability and feasibility (compared with no obfuscation). We will test a novel wearable camera with an infrared sensor (allows us to determine objects that are near vs. far in the camera) with 3 obfuscation methods in real-world settings, including a cartooning gaming–based method. We will then select the obfuscation method that increases wear time and design an eating algorithm around it. Using this algorithm we will assess our ability to capture behaviorally meaningful context from the obfuscated image, such as whether people are eating alone or not, at home, using screen time, and eating prepared or cooked food. This will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions in behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Obesity treatment would benefit greatly from an accurate understanding of problematic eating behaviors in real-world settings. Wearable video cameras provide significant utility in understanding eating behaviors, yet pose a major privacy concern in the real-world, significantly impacting longitudinal wear time. We are testing a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals with obesity will wear and that can accurately detect eating, which will advance our understanding of behavioral phenotypes surrounding obesity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild,10109884,R03DK127128,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cartoons ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Privatization ', ' Reading ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' realtime systems ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Device Designs ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' cooking ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Adherence ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Food Patterns ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' feeding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' usability ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Secure ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' preservation ', ' adult obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' privacy preservation ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,116737,IL-07
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arousal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Interview ', ' Melancholias ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Sleep ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' information gathering ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' heart rate variability ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' anxious ', ' depressed patient ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' affective computing ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501,MA-08
"BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline ABSTRACT Clinical Need: As the US population ages, managing pathologies that largely affect older adults, including sarcopenia (e.g., loss of muscle mass and strength), represents a significant and growing clinical challenge. In addition to increased rates of sarcopenia with age, it is well-accepted that its incidence and impact increases after acute illness, placing persons at additional risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance-based exercises promote muscle regeneration and strength, and are an advised therapy for such patients. Yet, exercises are normally conducted either under direct clinical oversight, or unsupervised by patients at home, where compliance rates are low. Limitations: Current regimens rely on self-report diaries or verbal reports that may be inaccurate and subject to recall bias. Remote monitoring systems that measure, track, analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and enhance exercise regimen engagement. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our Product – BandPass is a remote-sensing, bluetooth-enabled resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through a potentiometric sensor rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance training. The device is similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients, with the significant novel addition of integrated force monitoring and internet-connectivity. A mobile app and cloud-based platform will provide computational resources for data visualization, storage and analysis, which will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring of patient compliance and progress, and serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and mobile device). We hypothesize that BandPass will provide clinically relevant data on compliance and use of exercise training with feedback that will be personalized. Specific Objectives: We specifically propose to design custom electronics and housing for BandPass and to perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability. BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform we will implement for data transmission, storage, and analysis. Finally, we will deploy BandPass in a human subjects pilot study to demonstrate usability and system stability in an at-home setting. Future Directions: SynchroHealth is a small company developing an mHealth platform that uses internet-connected devices to help improve quality of life in older adults. This device will complement our existing efforts. By the end of this Phase 1 effort, we will have demonstrated that BandPass is functional in a human population and we will have provided evidence that this approach can be deployed effectively in an at-home setting. This will position us for Phase 2 funding focused on optimizing our device for manufacturing, developing and optimizing a full suite of cloud-based analysis tools and mobile applications, conducting clinical trials aimed at demonstrating efficacy, and preparing to register this as a 510(k)-exempt device for marketing purposes and establishing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical care for older adults that suffer from sarcopenia (e.g. loss of muscle mass and strength) typically involves the use of physical therapy regimens that rely on patients performing a series of at-home resistance-based exercises in order to retain or build muscle strength and prevent further atrophy. Resistance exercises using elastic bands has been a primary tool for clinicians, however remotely monitoring a patient’s compliance, confirming the quality of exercises performed, and tracking performance has been a significant challenge, with no tools currently available to provide this level of insight. Here, we propose to develop BandPass, an internet-enable resistance exercise band instrumented to automatically sense forces generated during exercise which will enable remote monitoring, compliance checking, and exercise classification and help to overcome the current shortcomings in clinical management of these patients.",BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline,10152884,R41AG071290,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Boston ', ' Capital ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Equipment ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Interview ', ' Marketing ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Persons ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Pathology ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Custom ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' muscle strength ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' validation studies ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Drops ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Non-Invasive Cancer Detection ', ' Non-Invasive Detection ', ' Noninvasive Cancer Detection ', ' Noninvasive Detection ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical care ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' Regimen ', ' operation ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' exercise regimen ', ' Exercise routine ', ' age-related muscle loss ', ' age associated muscle atrophy ', ' age-associated decline in muscle ', ' age-associated muscle decline ', ' age-associated muscle deterioration ', ' age-associated muscle loss ', ' age-associated muscle wasting ', ' age-related decline in muscle ', ' age-related muscle decline ', ' age-related muscle deterioration ', ' age-related muscle wasting ', ' exercise training ', ' resistance exercise ', ' Cloud Service ', ' Android ', ' clinical development ', ' Bluetooth ', ' Infrastructure ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' remote monitoring ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,SYNCHROHEALTH LLC,R41,2021,224700,NH-02
"Closed-Loop Stimulus Optimization to Increase Communication Efficiency in Brain-Computer Interfaces ABSTRACT This administrative supplement is in response to the Notice of Special Interest to improve the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-Readiness of NIH-supported sata (NOT-OD-21-094). Summary of Parent Award. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems are used by people with communication and motor disabilities, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to communicate and interact with their environment. There are conventional AAC devices that are controlled by access methods such as touch, switch, head tracking and eye gaze; however, these access methods become difficult or impossible to use when sustained muscle control or voluntary motor control is lost. There are brain-computer interface (BCI) communication systems, such as the P300 speller, that use sensory stimulation to elicit and then detect sensory neural responses in electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, communication with stimulus driven BCIs is suboptimal due to relying on inherently noisy EEG data and highly variable neural responses for BCI control. BCI communication rates can potentially be improved by leveraging information in EEG data in real-time to optimally tune the BCI system’s parameters to maximise BCI performance under conditions of uncertainty. This work investigates a novel closed-loop stimulus selection algorithm that optimises the stimulus presentation schedule of the P300 speller in real-time based on the measured EEG data and the BCI system’s belief about the user’s intent. Aim 1 develops and tests the novel algorithm in a cohort of abled- bodied individuals to evaluate the real-time feasibility and utility of closed-loop stimulus selection. Aim 2 will test the closed-loop stimulus selection algorithm in a cohort of individuals with ALS to assess the performance of the algorithm in target BCI end users. Goals of this Supplement. There is a current unmet need for large, diverse BCI datasets that include target BCI end users for BCI algorithm development, particularly with the popularity of data hungry deep learning models. Based on NIH-supported research for 10+ years, we have acquired a large amount of single- and multi-session data from P300 speller studies with abled-bodied participants and participants with ALS using different stimulus presentation paradigms. Guided by FAIR principles, in this supplement: (1) we will perform data curation, data cleaning and data engineering to develop a cross-platform readable P300 speller dataset with common data and metadata elements and make this dataset publicly available; and we will demonstrate the usability of this dataset in (2) an AI/ML application focused on developing robust data representations to mitigate the negative effect of variabilities in EEG data on AI/ML algorithms; and (3) in student research programs focused on skill development in data science and AI/ML. A large, inclusive and accessible BCI dataset will have significant impact in the BCI community and the broader AI/ML community, as it will support research to develop and compare novel data representations, stimulus paradigms and neural signal decoding algorithms towards establishing BCIs as viable AAC devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE People with significant motor disabilities often require assistive devices such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems to communicate and interact with their environment. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide access to AAC systems and other devices for individuals with little to no voluntary muscle control in order to facilitate their communication with the outside world; however current BCI communication accuracies and speeds are suboptimal. The goal of this research effort is to develop and test the use of closed- loop optimisation techniques in BCI system design, where information from previous user responses and actions by the system is considered during the selection of the next action of the system. These closed loop techniques will be used to optimise BCI stimulus presentation parameters during real-time use to improve BCI communication efficiency, and demonstrated success of the proposed closed-loop stimulus optimisation method in real-time BCI use has the potential to accelerate the translation of BCI systems into viable AAC devices.",Closed-Loop Stimulus Optimization to Increase Communication Efficiency in Brain-Computer Interfaces,10412578,R21DC018347,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Refractory ', ' Pythons ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Measurement ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' spelling ', ' interest ', ' gaze ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' graduate student ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' AAC Device ', ' AAC Intervention ', ' Augmentative and Alternative Communication ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Belief System ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' time use ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' file format ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' brain research ', ' motor control ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' student participation ', ' student engagement ', ' student motivation ', ' learning community ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Engineering ', ' Learning Skill ', ' communication device ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data cleaning ', ' data cleansing ', ' algorithm development ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' data curation ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,266638,NC-04
"Resolving and understanding the genomic basis of heterogeneous complex traits and diseases Parent grant Resolving and understanding the genomic basis of heterogeneous complex traits and diseases. Hundreds of genomics studies have exposed major gaps in our understanding of the mechanistic relationships between genomic variation, cellular processes, tissue function, and trait variation. The goal of the parent project is to develop a suite of computational frameworks that integrate massive collections of genomic and biomedical data to make the following three advances: Direction 1: Discern and leverage mechanism-based subtypes of complex traits and diseases. Direction 2: Characterize physiology and disease along the human lifespan and across the sexes. Direction 3: Find analogous contexts in model organisms for studying human traits/diseases. As demonstrated by us and others, genome-wide molecular networks are grand unifiers of molecular data and knowledge, and serve as powerful tools to contextually understand the roles genes play in cellular pathways, tissue physiology, phenotype/disease mechanisms, and drug action. Hence, a central aspect of our parent project is to develop multiple machine learning approaches to leverage molecular networks to generate accurate, testable hypotheses about the roles genes play in defining subtypes, age/sex differences, and cross-species analogs of a range of complex disorders.  As part of this work, we have developed GenePlexus github.com/krishnanlab/GenePlexus, an open source software to run and benchmark our state-of-the-art approach for combining genome-scale networks with supervised machine learning (ML) to get accurate novel predictions about various gene attributes (e.g., pathway membership or disease association; Liu*, Mancuso*, et al., 2020 Bioinformatics). Similarly, our group has committed efforts to make all our other computational methods available to the broader biomedical research community in the form of software tools for open science. We have released such software with nearly all our papers. Other recent examples include: ● PecanPy github.com/krishnanlab/PecanPy for parallelized, efficient, and accelerated node2vec. ● Expresto github.com/krishnanlab/Expresto for imputing unmeasured genes in transcriptomes. ● Txt2Onto github.com/krishnanlab/Txt2Onto for annotating –omics samples based on free-text metadata. Goal of the supplement project and current prototype GenePlexus: A cloud platform for network-based machine learning The goal of the proposed supplement is to take our software development to the next level by a building a new cloud-based GenePlexus platform to enable: i) biomedical/experimental researchers to seamlessly take advantage of network-based ML to generate interpretable genome-wide predictions, and ii) computational researchers to run network-based ML, retrieve results, and integrate with existing data analysis workflows. The project team, which includes the PI, a postdoc trained in cloud computing, and two professional software engineers – has worked together over the past six months to develop a prototype of the GenePlexus platform (in the form of a web-server mounted on Microsoft Azure; Fig. 1). Figure 1: Screenshots of the current prototype of the GenePlexus webserver that implements our original GenePlexus software github.com/krishnanlab/GenePlexus. When a user uploads a geneset, GenePlexus creates a virtual machine that trains a ML model, leveraging pre-saved data. In addition to predicting genes in the network functionally similar to the user-supplied genes, GenePlexus provides enables the user to interpret the custom-built ML model in terms of its similarity to thousands of models that were trained to predict genes associated with biological processes (from Gene Ontology) and diseases (from DisGeNET). In addition to retrieving the prediction results in multiple convenient formats, users can visualize the top predicted genes as a network graph. Narrative We are proposing to bring together two powerful approaches in biomedical data science – genome-scale network analysis and supervised machine learning (ML) – in the form of a cloud platform called GenePlexus. This platform will enable both biologists and bioinformaticians to easily perform network-based ML on massive genome-scale molecular networks and get novel interpretable predictions about gene attributes of interest. This work represents a significant step towards making AI more accessible to all researchers and labs and will help us and the community learn general design principles and best practices for running, storing, retrieving, and sharing ML models and results.",Resolving and understanding the genomic basis of heterogeneous complex traits and diseases,10406616,R35GM128765,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Information Networks ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Memory ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Processed Genes ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Privacy ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' analog ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' trait ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' drug action ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Security ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Text ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' disease phenotype ', ' cost ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' molecular scale ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data structure ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' prototype ', ' parent grant ', ' parent project ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' cloud based ', ' genomic variation ', ' learning community ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' web server ', ' computational suite ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' biomedical data science ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' virtual machine ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,234750,MI-08
"The development and validation of a novel tool for the assessment of bulbar dysfunction in ALS Project Summary  The overall aim of our “parent” grant proposal is to develop and validate a clinician-administered bulbar dysfunction assessment tool for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), called ALS-Index of Bulbar Dysfunction (ALS-IBD). Interrupted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, clinical practices as well as clinical research have been forced to pivot, simultaneously providing an unprecedented opportunity for the development of new and expansion of existing remote assessment platforms, which can serve clinical and research assessment needs. As part of this pivoting effort, we recently created VirtualSLP, a software tool to support remote, online multi- modal - high quality video/kinematic and audio/acoustic – data collection, using a multi-platform compatible, web-browser based audio and video recordings. In parallel, we have designed a tool for automatic extraction of kinematic and acoustic metrics of neurological diseases, which provides clinically interpretable features/ measures that have been identified as important for detecting and tracking the onset and progression of oro- motor and speech (aka bulbar) impairments in neurological diseases. The next step in the progression of our technology development efforts is to incorporate the automatic metrics extraction software within VirtualSLP, creating a user-friendly and intuitive cloud-based platform for research and clinical assessment of bulbar dysfunction. To achieve rapid development and deployment of VirtualSLP, we will use modern engineering methodology and user-centered design to iterate through a number of steps in the software development cycle. The cycle will begin with the engagement of end users (e.g., researchers, clinicians and patients) in design sessions to document users' current and anticipated end-to-end experiences with the software, while performing the baseline analysis of the existing software components and determining and implementing necessary changes. The necessary components will be incorporated to create VirtualSLP on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, to enhance its usability, interoperability, scalability, and security, as part of the NIH STRIDES initiative. Usability testing of Virtual SLP with end users will be performed throughout the development process and at the end of the development cycle. When completed, the work will result in an enhanced software tool for collection of audio and video data and corresponding AI-based analytics to be used in the context of clinical research. VirtualSLP will propel our specific work on developing a clinician- administered tool for bulbar ALS assessment and monitoring (ALS-IBD-Remote) by providing a novel cloud- based platform for its clinical validation. This work aims to exemplify the intent of the current funding opportunity by supporting collaborations between clinical speech scientists, data scientists, and software engineers to enhance the design, implementation, and ""cloud-readiness"" of research software. Project Narrative  The current proposal focuses on the development of VirtualSLP, a software tool for video and audio data collection and automatic AI-based analytics to be used in the context of clinical research. VirtualSLP will propel our specific work on developing a clinician-administered tool for the assessment and monitoring of bulbar ALS, as well as other neurological diseases, by providing a novel cloud-based platform for validation of remote assessment. The development of VirtualSLP will follow the best practices of software engineering using the enterprise architecture framework and agile methodology, with focus on inclusive, user-centered

"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,10294298,R00DA046564,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' secondary analysis ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2021,248999,TX-09
"Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY Interfaces between tissues either transfer load (requiring toughness) or provide a smooth surface (requiring low friction). Fibrous interfaces are very effective at transferring load between tissues, e.g., at connective tissue-bone interfaces (“entheses”), peritoneal-mesentery interfaces, interfaces between layers of the vasculature, and the pia mater. These interfaces require toughness to resist high stresses associated with material mismatches. Surgical repair can lead to smooth interfaces becoming fibrous, (e.g., following hernia surgery) or to tough interfaces becoming weak (e.g., following tendon- and ligament-to-bone repair). In older patients with large rotator cuff repairs, for example, where the desired attachment is not reformed, up to 94% of surgical repairs fail. These challenges arise in part because the features that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness are not known. We therefore propose to develop a comprehensive modeling and experimental approach for studying the factors underlying the transition from tough to weak in a fibrous interface. Our previous work motivates the hypothesis that disorder is a key toughening feature of fibrous attachments. We will focus initially on the example of tendon attaching to bone, in which microscale disorder underlies the ordered macroscale, graded transition between the two tissues, as a foundation for studying the general problem of adhesion throughout the body. We predict that disorder enhances energy absorption by distributing failure processes and energy absorption over larger volumes of tissue. We propose this as a fundamental mechanism by which fibrous interfaces in the body transfer load effectively. We will test these ideas through two aims: (1) Identify and model the mechanisms of fibrous attachment toughening ex vivo. We will model and experimentally validate how disorder across length scales toughens the tendon-to-bone attachment. Hierarchical molecular dynamics-to- continuum models, enriched by machine learning, will be validated in vitro, in systems with nanoscale control of mineral distributions, and ex vivo, in tissue samples of fibrous attachments. (2) Identify and model the loss of fibrous attachment toughness due to pathologic settings in vivo using murine rotator cuff tendinopathy models. In both aims, nano- through milli-scale characterization will be performed to define the mechanisms driving mechanical behavior. We will test the hypothesis that pathology- induced changes at multiple length scales will predict changes in failure mode. These models and experiments will test the global hypothesis that energy absorption across hierarchies is a fundamental toughening mechanism by which fibrous interfaces resist injury level loads. Taken together, we believe that these new models of fibrous attachment will enable an understanding of how the order and complexity of fibrous attachments leads to effective attachment of tissues. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tough fibrous interfaces between tissues are a common location of injury and source of pathology, pain and disability. Surgical repairs of interfaces that are desirable proceed in the absence of knowledge of the mechanisms that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness, and unsurprisingly have very high failure rates of up to a nearly unbelievable 94%. By developing and testing the first mathematical models for the toughness of this class of interfaces, we hope to identify the mechanisms of toughening definitively, and more broadly to provide technology that enables design of improved surgical procedures.",Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics,10222575,R01AR077793,"['absorption ', ' Adhesions ', ' Adhesives ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' bone ', ' Bone Regeneration ', ' bone repair ', ' regenerate bone ', ' Botulinum Toxin Type A ', ' Botulinum A Toxin ', ' Botulinum Neurotoxin A ', ' Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A ', ' Clostridium botulinum A Toxin ', ' botulinum toxin A ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Collagen ', ' Collagen Diseases ', ' collagen disorder ', ' collagenopathy ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hernia ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laparotomy ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligaments ', ' Mesentery ', ' Mesenteric ', ' Minerals ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pia Mater ', ' Running ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Friction ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Meniscus ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Bone Tissue ', ' millimeter ', ' Peritoneal ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Skin ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Length ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' nano ', ' Tendinopathy ', ' Tendinitis ', ' Tendonitis ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanocrystal ', ' nano crystal ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' mechanical behavior ', ' treadmill ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,474719,MO-01
"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products.

"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,10166912,R01HL151240,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Arteries ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Deprivation ', ' deficient sleep ', ' inadequate sleep ', ' insufficient sleep ', ' sleep debt ', ' sleep deficiency ', ' sleep deficit ', ' sleep insufficiency ', ' sleep loss ', ' Supine Position ', ' Dorsal Position ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' electric impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' sensor ', ' Sphygmomanometers ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' monitoring device ', ' cohort ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' artery stiffening ', ' artery stiffness ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' model development ', ' Skin ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Microfabrication ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' FDA approved ', ' sleep position ', ' supine sleep ', ' non-prone sleep ', ' Regimen ', ' Patient risk ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' motion sensor ', ' advanced analytics ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' Home ', ' ']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2021,678001,TX-17
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19

"Quantitative histopathology for cancer prognosis using quantitative phase imaging on stained tissues Summary Fast, accurate, and scalable testing has been recognized unanimously as crucial for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics. We propose a technology that allows rapid (~2 minutes) testing for SARS CoV-2. Our technology combines novel label-free imaging and dedicated deep-learning algorithms to detect and classify viral populations in exhaled air. If successful, this project will result in a device based on quantitative phase imaging and integrated AI tools, which will detect the unlabeled virus acquired by the patient’s breath condensed on a microscope slide. Toward this goal, we will advance Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), an ultrasensitive label-free imaging technique, proven to measure structures down to the sub-nanometer scale. SLIM was developed in the PI’s Lab at UIUC, its original publication received 490 citations to date, and has been commercialized by Phi Optics (Research Park, UIUC), with sales across the world in both academia and industry. Applying the computed fluorescence maps back to the QPI data, we propose to measure nanoscale features of viral particles, with high specificity, minimal preparation time, and independent of clinical infrastructure. As a result, the new technology will eventually be ideal for point-of-care settings, surveillance screening and as a home monitoring device. We anticipate that our approach will be scalable to other viruses, with new imaging and training data. Narrative We propose a breath test using label-free imaging and AI: an individual exhales on a microscope slide, which is fed into a SLIM microscope equipped with a computer that runs deep-learning pre-trained algorithms for SARS CoV-2 identification.

"BGscope: a non-invasive, continuous, and accurate O2 AND CO2 sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Blood gases are the primary indicators of effectiveness of ventilation, circulation and perfusion in neonates. Every year ~ 4 million babies are born in the United States. Of these, 15% (~500,000) suffer from respiratory distress mainly due to prematurity and/or low birth weight. These babies are transferred to the neonatology intensive care unit (NICU) immediately after birth, for whom approximately 10 million blood gas tests are performed annually. The gold standard of measuring blood gases are invasive procedures where blood is drawn through arterial lines connected to the umbilical cord, through needle pokes of the heel (known as heel stick) for capillary blood or through a venous line. While arterial sampling provides the highest accuracy, it is not easy to perform and poses a high risk of infection; capillary sampling is the most frequently performed procedure, with the consequences of being painful and a high chance of sample clotting; venous sampling is very easy to perform with the least accuracy among all the previous methods. Therefore, non-invasive, continuous monitoring devices are essential to avoid the adverse effects of the blood gas test. Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), are the most important respiratory gases, and their partial pressures (PO2 and PCO2) and oxygen saturation (SO2) collectively reflect the overall adequacy of respiratory function. Conventional O2 sensors (popularly known as pulse oximeters) are based on optical spectrophotometry technology and are relatively large to be placed on the limb of the premature/ preterm neonate and consequently lose signal integrity. CO2 sensors (popularly known as transcutaneous CO2) detect the dissolved CO2 gas in blood through skin by depositing heat onto a localized capillary bed. In both cases, the blood gas measurement is at the capillary level and is unable to provide the accuracy of the gold standard. In addition, these sensors are capable of only measuring one of two blood gases. Moreover, continuous operation of these sensors generates heat and may damage the sensitive skin of neonates. Therefore, frequent repositioning of the sensor is required, and further blood draws are necessary for the sensor recalibration. Our product non-invasively measures arterial blood gas; partial pressures of O2 and CO2 (PO2 and PCO2) and SO2. It is a simple wristband that can be used at the wrist or ankle. It does not generate heat or damage sensitive tissue. It continuously measures arterial blood gases (O2 and CO2) with high accuracy. Our proposed device will help reducing the blood draws from NICU babies by ~75%. We have named it BGScope for Blood Gas Scope. BGScope works based on the principles of multispectral photoacoustic imaging.

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time. The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,10425512,R01DK122473,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Feedback ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Running ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' increased appetite ', ' Appetite stimulated ', ' Increased food appetite ', ' increased hunger ', ' Ingestion ', ' sucking ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' weight maintenance ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' healthy weight ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2021,61011,AL-07
"Improving the usage and impact of the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry Project Summary The Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry (IASDR) is a repository designed for sharing data across the NIH-funded national network of Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs). The IASDR hosted and maintained by the OAIC’s Coordinating Center (CC). As a domain-specific repository, the existing IASDR contains multiple data sets generated from aging studies conducted at the Wake Forest OAIC (WF-OAIC), as well as a biospecimen bank for samples collected from some of the included studies. The IASDR thus serves as a valuable resource for the aging research community, especially for early career faculty. The data repository befits early career investigators who want to conduct small pilot studies for testing out conjectures and research hypotheses, and to efficiently produce useful information such as preliminary effect sizes for grant applications or to power future studies. Gaps were identified when the IASDR was evaluated against modern repository requirements. The IASDR was first started more than a decade ago, and the development process did not necessarily strictly adhere to contemporary biomedical-data repository principles such as the FAIR and TRUST principles. Importantly, barriers are present for users in accessing key information for decision support. For example, currently summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, frequency for variables and association information between variables, which are often critical in helping users to decide whether or not to pursue actual data, are not present in the IASDR metadata. The lack of such preliminary information could deter interested users from using the repository. To address gaps and limitations of the IASDR as related to its “FAIR”-ness and “TRUST”- worthiness, this proposal contains two specific aims: (1) Enhance the metadata layer by providing users with key analytic information such as mean, frequency, and association between variables, and (2) improve the IASDR along the FAIR and TRUST principles and seek certification. Project Narrative The proposed project improves an existing data repository, the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry (IASDR), which contains both data and biospecimen from multiple aging studies, along principles for modern data repository. The improvement will increase usability and confidence of the aging research user community.",Improving the usage and impact of the Integrated Aging Studies Databank and Registry,10408207,U24AG059624,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Certification ', ' Communities ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Biological Specimen Banks ', ' Biological Substance Banks ', ' biological specimen repository ', ' biosample repository ', ' biospecimen bank ', ' biospecimen repository ', ' specimen bank ', ' specimen repository ', ' Link ', ' Visual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Licensing ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Physical Function ', ' interest ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' computer center ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' Structure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' study characteristics ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' data sharing ', ' early-career faculty ', ' data access ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' Infrastructure ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' TRUST principles ', ' Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U24,2021,232275,NC-06
"Development of an adaptive machine learning platform for automated analysis of biomarkers in biomedical images ABSTRACT Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists is time intensive, requires intensive training, and prone to introduce bias and error. Optical analysis of targets within tissue samples, cultures, or specimens is fundamental to detecting biological properties, including protein interaction within the central nervous system, sperm counts, digestive-system parasites, and immune response to viral infections like COVID-19. Unintentional bias and attentional limitations during analysis of biomarkers can underlie poor reproducibility of findings in biomedical research and potentially introduce errors to clinical diagnostics. These problems are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine, developing effective medical treatments, and promoting public confidence in scientific inquiry. Application of computer vision for cellular target detection is a promising approach to reducing human bias, subjectivity, and errors that limit the reproducibility of research and slow the development of effective medical treatments. Our image analysis software, called Pipsqueak AITM, and the underlying artificial intelligence (AI) technology developed during our NIH SBIR Phase I award, have significantly increased inter- and intra-rater reliability of tissue sample analysis and decreased analysis time for multiplexed biomarkers. Pipsqueak AI is available now as an integration to ImageJ/FIJI (https://Pipsqueak.ai), and is capable of returning hundreds of accurate cellular target detections to the user within 300ms of image upload. During the last 6 months, Pipsqueak usership has exploded to over 1000 active monthly users, indicating high demand for computer vision technologies that improve the speed and accuracy of micrograph quantification. Our pre-trained ML models are capable of detecting multiple cellular morphologies and target types with precision and reproducibility that greatly exceed human analysis. Here, we propose to develop a pre-trained biomedical image analysis platform that rapidly and accurately identifies diverse cellular targets, and make this technology commercially available as a cloud computer vision service, called Sightologist.aiTM. Our computer vision AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) will be made available to research and clinical end-users through our Pipsqueak AI software and through 3rd party product integrations. To achieve these goals, we will build on our SBIR Phase I progress that developed ML models for biomarker detection, and implement cloud distribution methods to deliver our computer vision service to remote users and applications.

"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits.
