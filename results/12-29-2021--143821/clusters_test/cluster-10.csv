"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Project Summary/Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project proposes the deployment of an AI-powered image-processing tool, named PostureCheck™, to automatically detect when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-extremity (UE) rehabilitation exercises. The system is based on a standard video camera and the artificial intelligence (AI) software developed under the NIH Phase-I project. PostureCheck™ will be fully integrated with Barrett Technology's existing Burt® UE rehabilitation robot, ensuring that patients are provided appropriate and timely feedback to encourage the correct performance of therapeutic exercises without requiring constant therapist supervision.  Burt® is an FDA-listed UE rehabilitation robot that supports the weight of a patient's arm and hand while the patient moves his/her arm to interact with on-screen games. Burt® offers guided assistance, visual and haptic feedback, and activities and assessments to both help train the patient and measure progress. Clinical studies have shown that Burt® can be used to improve patients' performance in one-on-one sessions with a therapist. However, the system lacks the capability for a single therapist to monitor and work with several patients and Burt® systems at one time.  The proposed SBIR Phase-II activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, the annotated dataset generated in Phase-I will be used to develop three separate AI modules. These modules will be integrated into a framework that allows therapists to monitor the outcome of the modules, and, through feedback, enable the system to auto- adapt to improve performance continuously. In Aim 2, stakeholder feedback will be gathered and integrated to design multiple user interfaces for the PostureCheck™ tool. Specific interfaces will be created for use by therapists during and after RT sessions. PostureCheck™ will be integrated with the Burt® device to empower therapists to provide effective feedback to patients and deter the use of compensatory movements. Finally, in Aim 3, forty-two stroke survivors will be recruited in an interventional study deploying the PostureCheck™ and Burt® systems. Subjects will undergo eighteen RT sessions in either an individual or group therapy format. Motor performance between groups will be compared to gather information about the suitability of the combined systems for multi-patient RT therapy in future rehabilitation centers.  The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a practical Burt®-plus-PostureCheck™ system to empower therapists to supervise multiple patients simultaneously through a gamut of useful functionalities. The system will be suitable for deployment in clinics as well as rehabilitation centers such as wellness gyms. Project Narrative  Each year, more than 650,000 Americans survive a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body in most cases. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and ultimately improved function. This proposal aims to expand PostureCheck™, to provide timely and targeted feedback and enable therapists to perform robot-assisted and multi-patient therapy in a minimally supervised session.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,10156853,R44EB027525,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Device ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Occupational Therapist ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Rehabilitation Centers ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Robotics ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' visual feedback ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Group Therapy ', ' cost ', ' robot assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Rehabilitation device ', ' rehab device ', ' cost effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' chronic stroke ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' arm ', ' motor recovery ', ' arm movement ', ' robot rehabilitation ', ' robotic rehabilitation ', ' stroke survivor ', ' exercise rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitative exercise ', ' Exercise Therapy ', ' recruit ', ' preservation ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep learning ', ' functional independence ', ' robotic system ', ' haptic feedback ', ' ']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R44,2021,813419,MA-04
"The Pathophysiological Role of Cerebellar Glia in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Rett  syndrome  (RTT)  is  the  leading  cause  of  severe  intellectual  disability  in  girls  and  women.  Individuals  with  RTT  develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  and  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2  (MECP2)  occur  in  >95%  of  RTT  cases.  Initially,  researchers  regarded  MeCP2  deficiency  in  neurons  as  the  exclusive  cause  of  RTT.  However,  recent  studies  have  revealed  that  glia  have  a  pathological  role  in  RTT  etiology. Studies have not yet uncovered the underlying cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction in Mecp2  rodent  models  or  the  impact  of  this  dysfunction  on  brain  function.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  examine  the  contribution  of  a  specific  glial  subtype,  Bergmann  glia  cells  (BGs)  in  the  cerebellum,  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT.  We  will  focus  on  BGs  because  (1)  cerebellar  disruption  likely  contributes  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT  and  (2)  BGs  are  the  major  glial  subtype  in  the  cerebellum.  We  propose  to  characterize  cerebellar  function  in  conditional  knockout  (cKO)  mice  that  lack  Mecp2  in  BGs  using  a  repertoire  of  approaches,  including  intracellular  whole-­cell  recordings,  in  vivo  recordings  of  single  units  and  local  field  potentials,  in  vivo  and  ex  vivo  imaging  of  genetically-­encoded  Ca2+,  glutamate,  and  dopamine  (DA)  sensors  (GCaMP7,  iGluSnFr,  and  dLight1.1,  respectively),  optogenetics,  chemogenetics,  near  super-­resolution  confocal  microscopy,  and  behavioral  assessments  using  unbiased  machine-­learning  approaches.  Our  preliminary results indicate deficits in BGs from Mecp2-­deficient mice, including higher expression levels of the  GluA1  subunit  of  AMPA  receptors  (AMPARs),  and  depolarized  membrane  potentials.  In  addition,  we  have  preliminary evidence of DAergic modulation of BGs through the activation of D1 receptors (D1Rs) activated by  either electrical or optogenetic stimulation of DAergic inputs to the cerebellum. Of high relevance to motor and  social symptoms in RTT, the expression levels of D1Rs, which modulate GluA1 surface insertion, are higher in  Mecp2  KO  mice.  We  hypothesize  that  BGs  in  the  cerebellum  have  a  pathophysiological  role  in  motor  and  social  deficits  in  Mecp2-­deficient  mice.  We  propose  two  Aims:  (1)  Define  cerebellar  BG  dysfunction  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice;;  (2)  Characterize  DAergic  modulation  of  cerebellar  BGs  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice.  The  proposed  studies  will elucidate the consequences of impaired DAergic modulation of astrocyte function on cerebellar-­dependent  behaviors,  which  will  have  broad  implications  not  only  for  RTT  but  also  for  other  brain  disorders  associated  with cerebellar dysfunction.     PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by MECP2 mutations, presents with stereotypic hand movements, ambulatory difficulties, and social impairments. Dysfunctional interactions between glial cells and neurons and their modulation by dopamine may play crucial pathological roles in developing neurological symptoms.

"A new mechanistic and technological framework for uncovering the spinal cord neural systems important for functional recovery after injury Project Summary and Abstract Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover, our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2) Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile.

"Impact of Cognitive function on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Project Narrative  Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A  significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a  neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)  including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical  need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including  preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity  associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also  provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.

"Tissue-specific protein interactome mapping in a vertebrate embryo Abstract Proteins rarely act in isolation, but rather function in multi-protein complexes. Accordingly, protein-protein interactomes are exceptionally valuable resources that provide deep mechanistic insights and generate myriad hypotheses. Current methods for interactome mapping, such as affinity purification mass-spectrometry (APMS), are extremely difficult to deploy in vivo, so little comprehensive interactome data yet exists for developing embryos and even less for specific tissues within embryos. This fact poses an especially acute problem for understanding highly dynamic processes in which post-transcriptional controls dominate, for example collective cell movements. Here, we will use tissue engaged in convergent extension, a crucial collective movement that elongates the axis of animal embryos, to test the efficacy of new label-free interactome mapping approaches. Successful completion of the project will therefore be significant both for developing broadly applicable new methods and also for providing systems-level insights into a disease- relevant, vertebrate collective cell movement. Project Narrative: This study centers on developing novel methods for systematically identifying protein-protein interactions in embryos. To explore the utility of the method, we focus our efforts on proteins involved in collective cell movements called convergent extension, which are governed by the planar cell polarity (or PCP) proteins. These experiments will be significant because defects in PCP proteins or convergent extension lead to “neural tube defects” such as spina bifida and anencephaly, as well as congenital skeletal dysplasias.",Tissue-specific protein interactome mapping in a vertebrate embryo,10271281,R21HD103882,"['Actomyosin ', ' Adhesions ', ' Amphibia ', ' Amphibians ', ' Animals ', ' Cadherins ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Affinity Chromatography ', ' affinity purification ', ' Communities ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Fractionation ', ' Chemical Fractionation ', ' FRACN ', ' Fractionation Radiotherapy ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mesoderm ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neural Tube Defects ', ' Neural Tube Developmental Defects ', ' Proteins ', ' Rana ', ' Frog ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Work ', ' Xenopus ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Mapping neural ensemble computations to biological circuitry in motor control and decision making - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract Movement is the primary way in which animals interact with the world. To produce the incredibly adaptable behavior of mammals the brain must continually choose actions, then flexibly generate control signals for the body. The main objective of this project is to understand how ensembles of neurons and brain areas work together to control movement and make simple decisions. To understand how behavior is generated, we must know: How is a high-level decision (e.g., reach left vs. right) transformed into a time-varying command signal? And, how does this transformation and the generation of complex outputs exploit the precise biology of neural tissue to function reliably, despite the inherent noisiness of neurons? This goal is critical not only to better understand how neural tissue implements challenging computations, but also because deeper knowledge of these processes is likely to improve treatments for motor disorders such as Parkinson’s and disorders heavily affecting neural connections such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. To achieve this aim, we pair the power of experimental tools in mice together with dynamical systems analysis, which provides mathematical tools for investigating the function of neural ensembles. In the monkey, the dynamical systems approach has led to many insights. For example, we have learned that activity in motor cortex unfolds over time according to oscillatory dynamical “rules”; that much of motor cortical activity exists to support these dynamical rules and does not influence movement directly; and that there is a separation between signals for what movement will be made and when it will be initiated. In the mouse, we propose taking this approach several steps further by mapping the dynamical rules to specific biological features, such as cortical layers and projection pathways. In Aim 1, we will use two-photon calcium imaging to record neural activity during a simple reaching task that elicits variable movements from the mouse. We will then exploit this variability with our dynamical systems tools to identify the rules that govern the M1 pattern generator, and uncover how these rules map to cortical layers. In Aim 2, we will determine how information processing is divided into stages as signals are passed from visual decision areas to motor areas. This second Aim will employ a more complex visually-guided joystick task, together with optogenetic inhibition of specific pathways, calcium imaging, and retrograde tracing. This will allow us to compare activity in the neurons that connect areas with those that are engaged only in local processing. Finally, in Aim 3, we will record from identified projection neurons and apply powerful new machine learning techniques to test two competing theories of how the brain produces consistent outputs: whether the brain suppresses neural “noise” in the output neurons themselves, or suppresses only task-relevant noise according to a more population- oriented approach. These findings will advance our understanding of sophisticated cortical processes including decision making and motor control by grounding theoretical ideas about neural computation in our biological understanding of the tissue that implements it. Project Narrative This study will greatly advance our fundamental understanding of how the brain controls movement and how brain areas interact to make simple choices. Uncovering the principles of operation in the motor system is likely to inform treatments for motor disorders such as Parkinson’s and enable better brain-machine interfaces for use by paralyzed patients. Understanding how brain areas communicate is vital for advancing treatment for stroke and traumatic brain injury, which often disrupt these connections.",Mapping neural ensemble computations to biological circuitry in motor control and decision making - Resubmission - 1,10297601,R01NS121535,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' fighting ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' theories ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Joystick ', ' Output ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' brain machine interface ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' motor control ', ' information processing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,391599,IL-01
"Clinical trial readiness in X-linked dystonia parkinsonism: assessment of sensor-based and blood biomarkers for early detection and monitoring disease progression PROJECT SUMMARY Parkinsonism, the second most common movement disorder, affects over 900,000 Americans and its prevalence is rising, while dystonia, the third most common, afflicts 250,000 Americans. X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a rare neurogenetic movement disorder with a wide phenotypic spectrum ranging from a parkinsonism indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease (PD), generalized dystonia, similar to DYT1 (a hereditary dystonia), or combined dystonia and parkinsonism. Female XDP carriers are at risk for parkinsonism, given X-inactivation and represents a possible genetic risk factor. As such, XDP serves as an excellent model of both dystonia and parkinsonism, and insights can inform both phenotypes and mixed movement disorders, which are notoriously challenging to assess. To provide adequate clinical trial endpoints, rater-independent, quantitative assessments of motor function are urgently needed to identify early abnormalities which may predate overt clinical symptoms and track disease progression, given the unreliability of rater-dependent clinical rating scales. This project will provide Dr. Stephen with a skill set that will allow him to assess potential quantitative measures of disease severity and progression in dystonia and parkinsonism using motion sensors and compare these measures with proposed biochemical biomarkers, using machine learning to define optimal parameters. This project aims to address three key knowledge gaps in dystonia and parkinsonism, using pure phenotypes (DYT1 and PD) and in combination (XDP): Aim 1) to utilize technology-based evaluations as more sensitive and accurate measures of dystonia in isolation (DYT1) vs. in combination with parkinsonism (XDP) compared to clinical scales; Aim 2) to examine the accuracy of sensor-based monitoring of disease progression over 1 year in XDP, PD and DYT1 patients; and Aim 3) to analyze 2 proposed blood biomarkers (one specific to XDP, and neurofilament light chain, a general marker of neurodegeneration) in XDP and combine these motor and blood markers, using machine learning to predict disease phenotype/biotype and clinical course. This research complements the NINDS objective of clinical trial readiness in rare neurological disorders, with a wider goal of better understanding these common phenotypes in the context of a mixed movement disorder, using innovative technology and analysis methods. The goal of this award is to prepare the candidate to become a fully independent investigator in the quantitative assessment of dystonia, parkinsonism and other movement disorders, in the setting of expert mentorship. The career development plan includes training goals: 1) learning transferrable motion analysis skills, 2) learning machine learning techniques to develop predictive models of motor behaviors and combining these with blood biomarker data; and 3) an introduction to biomarker science and bioinformatics. Successful completion of this project will put Dr. Stephen in a unique position to inform clinical trial readiness efforts in XDP, relevant to other dystonia and to prepare for submission of a competitive R01 application focusing on quantitative movement analysis and biofluid markers in genetic dystonia, parkinsonism and mixed movement disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinsonism is the second most common movement disorder in the U.S, affecting over 900,000 Americans (projected to reach greater than 1.2 million by 2030) and dystonia (involving the development of abnormal posturing and uncomfortable twisting) is the third most common, afflicting more than 250,000 Americans: both disorders are a considerable source of morbidity and disability. X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), a rare neurogenetic movement disorder has a combination of both generalized dystonia and parkinsonism, with a wide phenotypic spectrum and may represent an independent genetic risk factor for the development of parkinsonism in female heterozygous carriers, such that studying XDP, while comparing to both disorders in isolation (DYT1, another hereditary dystonia, and Parkinson's disease, the archetypal parkinsonism) will inform both of these phenotypes, as well as the understanding and assessment of mixed movement disorders. This project will provide important contributions to the literature by providing: 1) new ways to quantify the neurological examination, which could identify rater-independent relevant clinical trial endpoints; and 2) potential motor and proposed blood markers, which, using machine learning, may be more accurate in combination, as a method to detect early disease, track progression and predict disease course, which will benefit not only XDP but other conditions with both of these motor phenotypes and neurogenetic disorders.",Clinical trial readiness in X-linked dystonia parkinsonism: assessment of sensor-based and blood biomarkers for early detection and monitoring disease progression,10302039,K23NS118045,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dystonia ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Fusing motor neuroscience and artificial intelligence to create next-generation neural prostheses. ABSTRACT People with disabling motor disorders rely on assistive devices and caregivers for many of their most basic needs. Current assistive devices are inherently limited, as they rely on (and encumber) residual motor function as a command interface. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a pathway to more powerful assistive options by directly monitoring brain activity and using it to decipher movement intention in real-time. However, BMIs have yet to achieve performance and robustness that would warrant widespread clinical adoption. A key obstacle is that nearly all BMIs to date use direct decoding, i.e., they attempt to map the activity of brain areas like motor cortex (MC) directly onto external movement parameters such as velocity. This has resulted in BMIs that are brittle: they often fail in new contexts, and are highly sensitive to neural interface instabilities. Instead, I envision a radically different approach with the potential to impact virtually every existing BMI application. The central element is dynamical systems decoding (DSD), a framework I developed that fuses advances in motor neuroscience with cutting-edge AI methods to achieve unprecedented decoding accuracy. DSD uses neural networks to precisely reveal MC's complex internal activity patterns, known as dynamics, on a moment-by- moment basis. This enables a clean separation between activity related to internal dynamics and activity related to external movement parameters. In offline analyses, I showed that DSD enables a breakthrough in decoding, predicting movements on millisecond timescales with substantially higher accuracy than the current state-of-the- art. A key focus of this proposal is developing universal, subject-independent BMIs that harness the remarkable similarities in MC dynamics observed across subjects. Using new AI methods to model more than a decade of previously-collected monkey data, we will test whether subject-independent models can enable BMIs that work nearly `out of the box', with performance that could only be achieved through massive datasets, while still avoiding burdensome, subject-specific calibration. In parallel with offline studies, we will work directly with people who are paralyzed to develop online BMIs with unparalleled performance and robustness. Performance improvements will be achieved through hybrid decoding paradigms that capitalize on high-level movement information that is uniquely uncovered via DSD. While BMI robustness is typically limited in direct decoding – due to gradual changes in the specific neurons being monitored – DSD will enable robust BMIs by leveraging MC dynamics, which are stable for years and independent of whichever specific neurons are being monitored at a given time. These two innovations would enable BMIs that achieve unprecedented performance and on- demand, 24/7 reliability for years. If successful, these studies will pave the way to dramatically improving the performance, robustness, and clinical utility of nearly every BMI application. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a pathway to restore function for people who are paralyzed, such as those with spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This proposal aims to substantially increase the performance and robustness of BMIs by combining new developments from the field of artificial intelligence with recent advances in our understanding of brain function, with the goal of improving quality of life for people with severe movement disabilities.",Fusing motor neuroscience and artificial intelligence to create next-generation neural prostheses.,10246037,DP2NS127291,"['Adoption ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calibration ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' disability ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Performance ', ' neural prosthetic ', ' neural prosthesis ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' virtual ', ' next generation ', ' brain machine interface ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,1451191,GA-05
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury. PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus, we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure. Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI’s effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro. We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48’s five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury.,10393353,R01NS100531,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Contusions ', ' Bruise ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' In Vitro ', ' Information Theory ', ' Nerve ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Testing ', ' Transducers ', ' Walking ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' light microscopy ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' axonal sprouting ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' Catalytic Core ', ' Catalytic Region ', ' Catalytic Site ', ' Catalytic Subunit ', ' Catalytic Domain ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' CNS Injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' small molecule ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' axon growth ', ' axonal growth ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' Outcome ', ' Spinal cord injury patients ', ' SCI Patients ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' targeted agent ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,16781,FL-27
"Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways. To generate a complete picture of how sensory information affects motor actions, this project incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to provide a functional roadmap of how skin touch receptors interact with spinal cord motor centers to shape movement. By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function affected by disease or injury.",Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move,10438259,R01NS119268,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Foundations ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Joints ', ' Locomotion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle Contraction ', ' Muscle Cell Contraction ', ' Muscular Contraction ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Proprioception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Flexor ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Link ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Spinal cord posterior horn ', ' Dorsal Horn of the Spinal Cord ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' vibration ', ' Spinal ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' electrical property ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Proprioceptive Sensory Neuron ', ' Proprioceptor ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Motor Pathways ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Hindlimb ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Motor output ', ' Coupled ', ' somatosensory ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' motor function improvement ', ' improved motor function ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' sensory input ', ' cutaneous sensory neurons ', ' Extensor ', ' mouse genetics ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,39187,NJ-06
"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,10246175,K23HD096134,"['Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Exertion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mentors ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Probability ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Secondary to ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' muscle strength ', ' Coin ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' functional outcomes ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Kinesiology ', ' Movement science ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' translational study ', ' person centered ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' neurological recovery ', ' improved mobility ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' mobility improvement ', ' optimized mobility ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' gait recovery ', ' gait rehab ', ' gait retraining ', ' gait training ', ' Caregiver support ', ' Care giver support ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' preservation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' patient mobility ', ' biopsychosocial factor ', ' biopsychosocial variable ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2021,127999,PA-18
"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),10199067,UH3NS106899,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Modernization ', ' Multiple Trauma ', ' Multiple Injuries ', ' polytrauma ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal Injuries ', ' spine injury ', ' vertebral injury ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' success ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' economic impact ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' Address ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' productivity loss ', ' cost ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' Traumatic CNS injury ', ' CNS trauma ', ' central nervous system trauma ', ' traumatic central nervous system injury ', ' functional outcomes ', ' response to injury ', ' injury response ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' spinal cord and brain injury ', ' spinal cord & brain injury ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Data Science ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' data resource ', ' Precision Health ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' Data Commons ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' data curation ', ' Data Pooling ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH3,2021,323000,CA-12
"Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury After a spinal cord injury (SCI), clinicians must quickly decide where to focus therapy time to maximize an individual's functional mobility by discharge: either towards gait training or wheeled mobility interventions. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians in making those difficult decisions, but literature has shown that for individuals with moderate impairments, current CPRs that use age, strength, and sensation are not sufficient in predicting independent ambulation. Further, existing CPRs do not provide insight into clinically important descriptive measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance that contribute to functional ambulation. Our recent work demonstrated individuals who received gait training, but primarily used a wheelchair one year after SCI received less transfer and wheeled mobility training and had lower measures of participation than non-ambulatory individuals who never received gait training. In the context of decreasing inpatient rehabilitation length of stays, it is crucial that time in therapy be used efficiently to maximize function at discharge and avoid those long-term consequences.  Lower limb movement (LLM) captured using activity monitors may provide a more sensitive measure of strength and sensation than traditional methods such as manual muscle and light touch sensation testing. This technique is novel in that LLM has not yet been reported in literature for individuals with SCI. Our preliminary analysis has shown promise for the association between LLM, strength, and ambulatory ability (as defined by measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance). Using machine learning techniques, we are able to determine which factors have the strongest association with ambulatory ability, among LLM, subject demographics, clinical characteristics, and other covariates.  Our long-term goal is to improve CPRs that predict ambulation after SCI, thus enabling appropriately targeted functional mobility training. As a first step towards this goal, we will build a foundational knowledge of LLM and its relationship as a potential biomarker for ambulatory ability cross-sectionally among individuals with chronic SCI and known, diverse functional abilities (Aim 1). We will also explore longitudinal LLM data and ambulatory ability for a population with acute SCI (Aim 2) to evaluate changes in LLM over time and create a preliminary prediction model.  Achieving the proposed aims will provide new insights into factors that predict mobility in individuals with SCI and provide understanding as to how these factors change acutely following injury. Further, we will gain insight to guide a future multisite longitudinal study that will assess a new, more effective CPR. This CPR will aid clinical decision-making for individuals with SCI by allowing for optimally targeted therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum, thus improving long-term functional outcomes. Project Narrative Current rules are not sufficient in predicting ambulation among individuals with moderate strength and sensory deficits after a spinal cord injury, and this can lead to an inefficient use of therapy time. By measuring actual lower limb movement using activity monitors, we believe we can capture an unexplained variance missing from current prediction models that use traditional clinical measures to more accurately predict ambulatory ability. Accomplishing the goals outlined in this proposal will provide clinicians with a better understanding of ambulatory prognosis after spinal cord injury and will allow for optimal target therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum to maximize functional outcomes and quality of life.",Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury,10049966,F30HD096828,"['Accounting ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Caffeine ', ' Community Participation ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Probability ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal Injuries ', ' spine injury ', ' vertebral injury ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' limb movement ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' demographics ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' independent ambulation ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' gait recovery ', ' gait rehab ', ' gait retraining ', ' gait training ', ' spasticity ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' functional independence ', ' Home ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2021,39636,PA-18
"Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces Project Abstract. Candidate and career goals: I am an engineer by training, with a strong background in neural engineering and the development of motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). My career goal is to establish an independent nonhuman primate (NHP) laboratory with two primary aims. First, I will advance our fundamental understanding of the motor system via the combination of electrophysiology with novel statistical and computational methods. Second, I will leverage this knowledge to develop frameworks for superior BMI systems.  Throughout my academic and research career I have developed expertise in engineering, computation, and neuroscience with the goal of pursuing these aims. Advances in machine learning, large-scale neural recordings, and deep learning in neural networks are happening quickly (in part via the BRAIN Initiative), and are very promising for the field. Yet very few researchers have the correct combination of skills to make use of them in my areas of interest. In completing the proposed training, I will be uniquely positioned to perform the innovative work necessary to advance our understanding of the planning and execution of cortically controlled movements. I will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the experimental and computational methods necessary to understand fundamental principles of cortical computations.  Research plan: In this project, I will employ multiple computational approaches to understand the structure of population activity in motor cortex (M1) across multiple kinds of behaviors. I will then use that knowledge to create high performance BMI decoders that will be applicable to a wide range of movements.  Recent empirical observations are changing our view of the structure of M1 activity. During one particular task (e.g., reaching), neural activity may seem to exist within a small space that it explores completely. Yet as more tasks are observed, it becomes clear that activity comprises a highly structured geometry within a much larger space. This means that activity patters for different movements do not come ‘near’ one another or overlap. While counterintuitive, this geometry yields new opportunities. By exploiting the separation of activity patterns, movements can be readily distinguished, even when unfolding simultaneously. I will further explore this geometry across multiple behaviors, both in primates and neural network models, to develop new BMI methods. The specific aims of the plan are to (1) create a high-performance decoder for a novel wheelchair-relevant navigation task, (2) build network models to understand M1 activity structure and identify decoding principles that will generalize across tasks (reaching, navigation), and (3) implement a multitask BMI using a unified decoder that allows animals to both navigate and interact with objects. Career development plan: I will be trained by Dr. Mark Churchland and Dr. Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Project Narrative Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret brain activity to control external devices (computers, prosthetic limbs), and can restore voluntary movement to individuals with limb loss or paralysis. BMIs for reaching and grasping have been demonstrated in human clinical trials, and must now be extended to perform a variety of movements. The proposed work will use advanced computational methods to create an intuitively controllable and high performance BMI system applicable to many natural movements, including locomotion. This work will both develop neurotechnology, and add to our scientific understanding of the computational principles that underlie activity in motor cortex.",Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces,10126071,K99NS115919,"['Animals ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Locomotion ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Persons ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Development Plans ', ' Collaborations ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' career development ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' neurotechnology ', ' network models ', ' combat ', ' patient population ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Geometry ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' virtual reality environment ', ' immersive digital environment ', ' immersive environment ', ' immersive virtual environment ', ' immersive virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' limb loss ', ' lost limb ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2021,136242,NY-13
"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,10155611,R01NS112917,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' eyelid conditioning ', ' Electrodes ', ' Elements ', ' Forelimb ', ' Goals ', ' Golgi Apparatus ', ' Golgi ', ' Golgi Complex ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' Modernization ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Play ', ' Purkinje Cells ', "" Purkinje's Corpuscles "", ' cerebellar Purkinje cell ', ' Smooth Pursuit ', ' SPEM ', ' smooth pursuit eye movement ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' Fiber ', ' Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex ', ' Molecular Layer ', ' Molecular Layer of the Cerebellar Cortex ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' granule cell ', ' mossy fiber ', ' commune ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Brush Cell ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Preparation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor control ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' eyeblink conditioning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1275271,NC-04
"Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis Project Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi- omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS. Project Narrative Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which there are no biomarkers and only limited treatments stemming from a poor understanding of its pathogenesis. Here, we propose to integrate novel computational methods with spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of clinically deep-phenotyped postmortem ALS brains and spinal cords to determine the specific molecular correlates of functional impairment in this disease. By integrating these data with WGS and RNAseq data, our ultimate goal is to unveil how disease-associated variants drive specific dysfunction in ALS, which may in turn foster precision medicine-based treatment strategies.",Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis,10086894,R01NS116350,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral

"Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility Project Summary Mechanoregulation is a fundamental mechanism for the control of dynamic and multiscale biological systems. A mechanoregulatory network is responsible for the motility of cilia by converting the action of thousands of individual dynein motors bound to doublet microtubules in the cilium into a single waveform. This waveform has evolved to efficiently displace fluid, allowing either cell self-propulsion or the transport of extracellular liquid over epithelial surfaces. Ciliary motility in humans is therefore essential for the movement of sperm cells, the removal of bacteria and viruses from the respiratory tract, and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Cilia are also used by protozoan pathogens for movement, contributing to their pathogenicity. The biflagellate alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has become the model system for studying the relationship between cilia ultrastructure and ciliary motilty. Using this organism, we have determined single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the bases of dyneins and mechanoregulatory complexes natively bound to doublet microtubules. These structures map the interconnected network of microtubules, mechanoregulators, and dynein motors in unparalleled atomic detail. The structures reveal the mechanisms that dock mechanoregulators to doublet microtubules and generate new hypotheses for how they control dynein behavior. These preliminary structural studies provide a unique opportunity to better understand the structure, function and assembly pathway of the largest mechanoregulator, the radial spoke. In aim 1, I propose to elucidate the complete structure of a native radial spoke using cryo-EM and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Structural information will resolve how its 20+ unique subunits interact and function together to respond to both mechanical and chemical signals. Due to the high conservation of radial-spoke subunits among organisms, our structure will provide insights into the etiology of ciliopathy-causing mutations in humans. In aim 2, I propose to test hypotheses that have arisen from our “on-doublet” structures using an interdisciplinary combination of structure-guided mutagenesis, waveform analysis by high-speed microcinematography, and structural characterization using electron cryotomography. This work will provide experimental evidence for the fundamental molecular mechanisms that control ciliary motility. In aim 3, I propose to use a proteomic and structural approach to determine the mechanisms of radial-spoke assembly. This work will test our current structure-based model of assembly and has the potential to identify the first radial-spoke biogenesis factors. Collectively, these studies will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the mechanoregulatory pathways that control ciliary motility and promises to open new avenues for the treatment of ciliopathies. Project Narrative Motile cilia are microtubule-based organelles that produce a driving force for cellular locomotion or fluid flow. In humans, defects in motile cilia can lead to infertility, chronic respiratory disease, and even reversal of the orientation of the bodily organs. This project aims to reveal the detailed workings of the mechanoregulatory network that controls ciliary motility, which will help us to better understand the molecular basis of cilia-related diseases.",Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility,10180150,R01GM141109,"['Algae ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Cilia ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dynein ATPase ', ' Dynein ', ' Dynein Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Dynein Adenosinetriphosphatase ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoprecipitation ', ' Immune Precipitation ', ' Infertility ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' fertility cessation ', ' fertility loss ', ' infertile ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Locomotion ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Maps ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' Mucus ', ' mucous ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Oocytes ', ' Ovocytes ', ' Organelles ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Publishing ', ' Respiratory System ', ' Pulmonary Body System ', ' Pulmonary Organ System ', ' Respiratory Tracts ', ' Respiratory tract structure ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' sperm cell ', ' Sperm ', ' Spermatozoa ', ' zoosperm ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ', ' Chlamydomonas reinhardii ', ' Mediating ', ' nexin ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Organ ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Epithelial ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Pattern ', ' extracellular ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' fluid flow ', ' particle ', ' respiratory virus ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' cilium motility ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Cilium Microtubule ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' reconstruction ', ' pathogen ', ' driving force ', ' Molecular Machines ', ' biological systems ', ' ciliopathy ', ' ']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,414050,MA-07
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss.

"An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces PROJECT SUMMARY For millions with movement disorders including paralysis and ALS, intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are an emerging technology that aims to restore lost motor function and communication. The main component of a BMI is a decoder algorithm that translates neural activity from motor areas of the brain into the kinematics of a prosthetic device. Due to the complexity of these systems, which includes the BMI user interacting with the decoded kinematics in a closed-feedback loop, current technology requires expensive and invasive experiments to design, optimize, and validate decoder algorithms. The need for such experiments (1) results in slow develop- ment and evaluation of decoder algorithms, and (2) limits the scope of people who can work on these problems to a small group of nonhuman primate and clinical trial labs. As a consequence, BMIs have remained in pilot clinical trials since their ﬁrst reported demonstration in 2004. We propose a new open-source simulator for multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) BMI systems. The goals of this simulator are to (1) reduce the time it takes to evaluate and optimize BMI algorithms from months to minutes, and (2) signiﬁcantly expand the community of researchers who develop testable algorithms for BMIs. To build the simulator, we propose neural encoding models that generate synthetic motor cortical activity for multiple DOF tasks. This is possible because neural population activity is relatively low-dimensional and has dynamics, which can be learned via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We build our neural simulators using data collected from human clinical trials during point-to-point multi-DOF reaches. We also propose to develop new models of human controllers. This solves an important problem in BMIs: users learn new control strategies when controlling a particular BMI decoder algorithm. Our simulator uses deep imitation and reinforcement learning to solve this problem. It is constrained through imitation learning to perform actions like a human. It is optimized through reinforcement learning to explore new strategies – under the constraint of being human-like – to optimally control the BMI. Together, we expect these innovations will result in a purely software simulator that accurately predicts BMI performance and enables design and optimization. This tool will be open-sourced and available to all, enabling widespread development of BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE For people who have lost the ability to move due to movement disorders, including paralysis and ALS, intracor- tical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore movement and communication by directly decoding neural activity from motor regions of the brain. We propose to accelerate and democratize BMI research by building a computational simulator, implemented entirely in software, that enables researchers around the world to design and optimize BMI decoder algorithms. We expect this tool will reduce BMI evaluation time from months to min- utes, and by being widely available and open source to all, considerably increase the intracortical BMI research community.",An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces,10183995,R01NS121097,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Feedback ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Robotics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthetics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Equation ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' arm ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' deep reinforcement learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,394812,CA-33
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections.

"Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning PROJECT SUMMARY Expressive social behaviors, including speech and music, are culturally transmitted from a tutor to a pupil. Such learning depends on a pupil’s ability to integrate social and sensory cues provided by a tutor performing the relevant behavior. Once learned, the underlying motor program must be coordinated with a range of innate motor programs to generate holistic behaviors necessary to effective social signaling. The central hypothesis that this proposal seeks to test is that the same brain circuitry that enables the pupil to integrate social and sensory cues from an adult tutor also function in the adult to enable integration of the learned and innate programs necessary to effective social signaling. In the past cycle, we discovered where neural signals encoding social and sensory cues provided by a tutor are integrated in the pupil’s brain. Specifically, we showed that neurons in a midbrain dopamine cell group (A11) in a juvenile songbird are selectively excited during interactions with a singing adult male tutor, and that pairing song playback with the optogenetically- triggered release of dopamine from A11 terminals in a sensorimotor cortical analogue (HVC) is sufficient to drive song copying. Despite these important insights, exactly when and how tutor experience transforms auditory and motor coding in HVC to facilitate vocal learning remains unknown. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will use multiphoton (2p) longitudinal imaging, fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that tutor experience rapidly strengthens the auditory and motor network in the pupil’s HVC. We will also use novel machine learning tools for vocal analysis and optogenetic methods to test the idea that these sensorimotor changes enable HVC to enhance the acoustic complexity of the pupil’s song, a first step in vocal copying. Our prior studies support the idea that social and auditory cues provided by the tutor drive coincident DA release and auditory synaptic activity in the pupil’s HVC, rapidly potentiating sensorimotor synapses in this region. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will use ex vivo channelrhodopsin circuit-mapping to test the hypothesis that coincident DA release and auditory synaptic actvity rapidly potentiates auditory synapses onto HVC interneurons, and that these effects are strongest during juvenile sensitive periods for learning. Notably, the courtship display of the adult songbird includes a learned song that is seamlessly coordinated with a variety of innate behaviors, including female- directed calling, orientation, and pursuit. In Preliminary Studies, we found that lesions of A11’s axon terminals in HVC of the adult male finch abolish female-directed singing without affecting his innate courtship behaviors. In contrast, selectively ablating A11 cell bodies abolished all of the male’s courtship behaviors. In Aim 3, we will map, monitor and manipulate A11’s projections to HVC and other motor centers to test the idea that A11 acts as a central hub to enable the seamless and rapid coordination of learned and innate motor programs in response to social cues provided by a nearby female. PROJECT NARRATIVE Social learning is the foundation for speech, music and athletics but full mastery of these complex behaviors requires the fluent coordination of learned and innate motor programs. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a neural circuit comprising a midbrain dopamine cell group and its cortical and subcortical projections is crucial to social learning and the coordination of learned and innate motor programs.",Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning,10305438,R01NS099288,"['Acoustic Stimulation ', ' Auditory Stimulation ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Courtship ', ' Cues ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Instinct ', ' Innate Behavior ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Methods ', ' Music ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Photometry ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Pupil ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Speech ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Prosencephalon ', ' Fore-Brain ', ' Forebrain ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Whole-Cell Recordings ', ' analog ', ' zebra finch ', ' Finches ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Oscines ', ' song bird ', ' Songbirds ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Emotional ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' vocal learning ', ' Athletic ', ' Motor ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Coupled ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' optogenetics ', ' social learning ', ' brain circuitry ', ' learning outcome ', ' tutoring ', ' tutorial support ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354988,NC-04
"Spinal Neurons that shape the way we move: diversity supplement for Ms. Gonzalez Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways. To generate a complete picture of how sensory information affects motor actions, this project incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to provide a functional roadmap of how skin touch receptors interact with spinal cord motor centers to shape movement. By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function affected by disease or injury.",Spinal Neurons that shape the way we move: diversity supplement for Ms. Gonzalez,10352898,R01NS119268,"['genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' sensory input ', ' cutaneous sensory neurons ', ' Extensor ', ' mouse genetics ', ' motor behavior ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Foundations ', ' Horns ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Joints ', ' Locomotion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle Contraction ', ' Muscle Cell Contraction ', ' Muscular Contraction ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Proprioception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Flexor ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Link ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Spinal cord posterior horn ', ' Dorsal Horn of the Spinal Cord ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' vibration ', ' Spinal ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' electrical property ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' sensory system ', ' Proprioceptive Sensory Neuron ', ' Proprioceptor ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Motor Pathways ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Hindlimb ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Motor output ', ' Coupled ', ' somatosensory ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' motor function improvement ', ' improved motor function ', ' ']",NINDS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,2933,NJ-06
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,10118191,K23HD099275,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior

"Population Invariant Neural Decoding Neural interfaces hold great potential to restore movement and communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. These systems rely on neural decoding algorithms to translate recorded neural activity into, for example, movements of a prosthetic limb or intended speech sounds. However, many technical challenges limit the predictive accuracy of these decoding models, preventing widespread deployment of restorative neuroprosthetic devices. A key challenge is the limited data available to train decoding models. In existing approaches, models must be trained separately for each individual subject, usually during simple behavioral tasks, and consequently fail to generalize well to new subjects or complex naturalistic behavioral settings. This proposal leverages recent advances in machine learning that directly address these limitations by developing a new decoding model framework that is capable of combining neural data across many subjects and tasks, as well as incorporating large-scale simulated data to improve prediction accuracy. In this framework, a single global model learns an internal representation of the neural system that is invariant to variations in behavioral task and stimulus set, anatomical variations, and functional variations in neural tuning of the underlying neuronal population (i.e., population-invariant neural decoding). This global model can therefore be applied and calibrated to new subjects and behavioral tasks where little or no additional training data is available. Using an existing intracranial neural data set collected from a large number of different subjects and stimulus sets, the project will establish this new modeling approach based on deep learning architectures that are explicitly designed to incorporate data pooled across subjects and tasks. We propose to show, through validation on measured intracranial neural data, that a global neuronal population-invariant decoding model substantially improves model prediction accuracy and generalization relative to existing state-of-the-art neural decoding models across many subjects. Development and validation of this approach will open new avenues for researchers to combine disparate data sets, for example, enabling community development, improvement, and sharing of “open source” models that can be shared among research groups and effectively applied across research studies. Thus, the proposal seeks to address key limitations in present neural decoding model approaches which must ultimately convert measured neural activity into useful behavioral or communication parameters across a wide range of subjects and complex behaviors in order for translational effects to be realized in important clinical applications of neural interfaces. Neural interfaces rely on predictive models to restore lost motor or communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. This project leverages novel machine learning models that allow neural data to be pooled across large-scale multi-subject data sets, permitting an order of magnitude increase in model complexity and prediction accuracy that is immediately generalizable across large patient populations with disordered speech or motor function. The outcome of this project is a new modeling framework where a single, highly performant global model can be easily calibrated to individual patient cases with limited data while maintaining high prediction accuracy.",Population Invariant Neural Decoding,10074557,R21DC018374,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Community Developments ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' premonitory sensory phenomena ', ' sensory phenomena ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' open source ', ' patient population ', ' data sharing ', ' individual patient ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Data Pooling ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2021,196250,CA-13
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic.

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,10126727,R01CA215318,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ankle ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Tarsus ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Calibration ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Exercise ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Patients ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Physical assessment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Physical Function ', ' respiratory ', ' functional group ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' population movement ', ' Impairment ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' standard measure ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' doubly-labeled water ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' advanced analytics ', ' algorithm training ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,475626,WI-04
"A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change ABSTRACT  The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that impact a range of human behaviors including arm function, speech, and vision. Tools that can quantify motor deficits in a granular and objective manner are needed to support early recognition of clinical disease onset, more sensitively determine efficacy of a therapy, and make personalized predictions about disease progression. Such tools are needed for upcoming disease modifying clinical trials in SCAs, in order to reduce sample size and trial duration and better understand how a given therapy modifies human behaviors. Powered off of the currently available primary outcome measures for these rare ataxias, clinical trials are likely to face patient recruitment and retention challenges, especially with multiple co-occurring clinical trials. These challenges may impede or slow our ability to successfully discover therapies for our patients.  We have recently made substantial progress in capturing multimodal behavioral signals from speech, eye movement, and arm motor function using everyday technologies: a microphone, iPhone camera, and computer mouse. Our initial data indicate that these scalable technologies have strong potential to extend current clinical assessments in ataxia and that our novel machine learning approach for generating disease severity estimates performs better than the traditional regression model approach. Our algorithms are able to quantitatively identify signs of ataxia and parkinsonism in SCA individuals' speech and arm movement, even when absent on clinical assessment. Furthermore, our novel severity estimation algorithm enabled measurement of disease progression more sensitively than clinical scales. We propose to substantially expand longitudinal data collection and further develop our novel analytic approaches to train more powerful models for characterizing and quantifying human motor behavior. The technologies developed have the potential to facilitate clinical trials aimed at bringing disease modifying therapies to individuals with SCA. While the focus of this project is on SCA, the novel methodological approaches and data generated are applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases affecting movement and speech. Furthermore, this project will bring new insight into how motor abnormalities initially arise and progress.  The overall goal of this project is to develop widely available systems for improving early detection of clinical disease onset, severity assessment, and prognostication of spinocerebellar ataxias while simultaneously learning how these disorders impact fine-grained motor behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There are currently no disease modifying therapies for the spinocerebellar ataxias. One important barrier for development of new therapies for spinocerebellar ataxia and other neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of tools to objectively and sensitively measure a beneficial clinical response to a drug. This project aims to develop systems based on everyday technologies and sophisticated computational methods to provide accessible tools for early detection, precise severity measurement, and

"Cell Type Specific Genetic Manipulation to Dissect Cholinergic Interneuron Function and Plasticity in a Symptomatic Model of DYT1 Dystonia Project Summary/Abstract Cholinergic neurons (ChIs) are a central but poorly understood element of striatal circuitry. A considerable literature strongly implicates ChI dysfunction in the pathogenesis of abnormal movements, especially in dystonia and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease. A common theme of these studies is that maladaptive plastic changes cause aberrant ChI output and connectivity, promoting motor dysfunction. The central goal of this proposal is to advance understanding of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms through which ChIs cause motor dysfunction by employing novel selective genetic and chemical strategies in a recently validated model of DYT1 dystonia. Conditional Knock Out of torsinA from all striatal neurons (using Dlx5/6-Cre; “Dlx-CKO”) causes selective neurodegeneration of dorsolateral striatal ChI. ChI degeneration occurs roughly coincident with the juvenile onset of abnormal twisting movements in these mice, and selective ChI abnormalities are also present in postmortem tissue from DYT1 subjects. These movements are suppressed by the same anti-muscarinic compounds used to treat patients with DYT1 dystonia, establishing model therapeutic validity and suggesting shared pathophysiology with human dystonia. Surviving striatal ChIs are enlarged and hyperexcitable, and receive aberrant synaptic inputs. Selective ablation of these surviving ChI suppresses abnormal twisting, implicating these cells as key contributors to abnormal movements. Based on these data, we hypothesize that maladaptations in surviving ChIs drive motor dysfunction. Successful completion of the proposed studies will fundamentally advance understanding of maladaptive mechanisms whereby ChI function and connectivity drive abnormal movements, information highly significant for multiple striatal diseases. We will first address our hypothesis by testing the necessity of striatal ChI dysfunction in abnormal movement generation by selectively restoring torsinA to these cells (Aim 1), decisively moving beyond the current association between these factors. We will determine if cholinergic dysfunction arises primarily from intrinsic ChI abnormalities or defects in how they respond to afferents (Aim 2), and, informed by Aims 1 and 2, will pursue translational studies (Aim 3) testing whether directly modulating the activity of surviving ChIs can suppress dystonic-like movements. This proposal is therefore highly signifiant because it will define a circuit-based model of motor dysfunction that will inform the design of targeted therapeutics. Project Narrative DYT1 dystonia is an incurable brain disease characterized by involuntary twisting movements for which there are no reliably effective treatments. This proposal employs unique genetic strategies to target a specific class of neurons (striatal cholinergic interneurons) that appear essential to the abnormal movements. These advanced genetic studies will establish the role of cholinergic interneurons in dystonia and test a novel approach to prevent or suppress the disease symptoms.",Cell Type Specific Genetic Manipulation to Dissect Cholinergic Interneuron Function and Plasticity in a Symptomatic Model of DYT1 Dystonia,10210051,R01NS110853,"['Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Dyskinetic syndrome ', ' Abnormal Movements ', ' Dyskinesias ', ' Dystonia ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Literature ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tomography ', ' Glutamic Acid ', ' L-Glutamic Acid ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Autoreceptors ', ' Chemicals ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell type ', ' Ablation ', ' cholinergic ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropathology ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Slice ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' cholinergic neuron ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' Interneuron function ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' translational study ', ' TorsinA ', ' Torsin A ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' L-DOPA induced dyskinesia ', ' Levodopa dyskinesia ', ' levodopa induced dyskinesia ', ' optogenetics ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' Genetic study ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' motor behavior ', ' conditional knockout ', ' conditional knock-out ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,516285,TX-30
"Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways. To generate a complete picture of how sensory information affects motor actions, this project incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to provide a functional roadmap of how skin touch receptors interact with spinal cord motor centers to shape movement. By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function affected by disease or injury.",Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move,10266790,R01NS119268,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Foundations ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Joints ', ' Locomotion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle Contraction ', ' Muscle Cell Contraction ', ' Muscular Contraction ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Proprioception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Flexor ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Link ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Spinal cord posterior horn ', ' Dorsal Horn of the Spinal Cord ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' vibration ', ' Spinal ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' electrical property ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Proprioceptive Sensory Neuron ', ' Proprioceptor ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Motor Pathways ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Hindlimb ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Motor output ', ' Coupled ', ' somatosensory ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' motor function improvement ', ' improved motor function ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' sensory input ', ' cutaneous sensory neurons ', ' Extensor ', ' mouse genetics ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,432838,NJ-06
