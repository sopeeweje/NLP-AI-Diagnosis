"Deep-learning based profiling of patient-derived cells as a tool for genomic and translational medicine Project Summary/Abstract: The genetic landscape of rare and common diseases has emerged as heterogeneous and complex. Already, researchers and clinicians face the challenge to discern pathophysiological mechanism and treatment opportunities for hundreds of genetic subtypes that have been identified in rare diseases, such as inherited neuropathies (INs) or mitochondrial diseases (MiDs) alone. Still, a large fraction of disease loci remains to be discovered – a daunting task, since gene-identification studies often require immense sample-sizes, which are difficult to achieve, even for more common conditions. Simultaneously, much of the heritability of many disorders appears to be determined by the collective impact of possibly thousands of low-impact variants, spread across the genome. Ideally, the impact of a given set of candidate variants could be assessed within high-throughput framework that accounts for the genetic context of individual patients. Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms, we have developed an unbiased, scalable method to rapidly identify disease- associated phenotypes in high-resolution, multiplexed, fluorescent microscopy images of primary, patient derived cells. In turn, the discovered phenotypes can be exploited as experimental signals against which the disease relevance of candidate variants can be confirmed, by virtue of genetic complementation experiments. At the same time, the standardized and scalable nature of our method renders it suitable to test potential therapeutic interventions, e.g. to test the efficacy of potential gene-therapy, or to screen small molecule libraries, while maintaining patient-specific granularity. The goal of this proposal is to apply our approach to an expanded cohort of patient cells and to refine methods to interpret both genetic and pharmacological perturbations. In this, I will be supported by an exceptional and multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical, molecular and functional genetics, and computer scientists, within the world-class scientific environment offered by Columbia University and the Broad Institute. In a carefully designed development plan, I will finalize my training in machine learning and data science, expand my expertise to single-cell RNA-sequencing and other single-cell methods, and acquire essential leadership and scholarly skills required for an independent research career. Over the course of this award, I will apply our cellular profiling approach to generate a standardized map of deep, quantitative descriptions of disease-associated cellular phenotypes across a number of INs, MiDs and neurodegenerative conditions. We will explore the integration of RNA-sequencing to enhance our approach. Finally, we will apply our method to the discovery and confirmation of new disease genes, and screen a limited number of pharmacological interventions through our method. Together, the proposed developmental plan and research strategy will foster my ability to lead an independent research program, to establish cellular profiling as a powerful platform to advance genomic and translational medicine. Project Narrative: The functional interpretation of genetic variation in diseases faces critical roadblocks, due to the lack of scalable methods to assess the significance of candidate variants experimentally, while accounting for genomic context. This proposal introduces a morphological profiling method, that is able to rapidly identify disease-associated phenotypes in patient cells and offers a cost-efficient and unbiased way to determine the significance of putative pathogenic variants at scale. If successful, this proposal will establish cellular profiling of patient cells as a powerful platform to advance genomic and translational medicine.",Deep-learning based profiling of patient-derived cells as a tool for genomic and translational medicine,10106181,K99HG011488,"['Accounting ', ' Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' success ', ' chemical library ', ' small molecule libraries ', ' Inherited Neuropathy ', ' hereditary neuropathy ', ' cohort ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' skills ', ' Phenocopy ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Heritability ', ' translational medicine ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' efficacy testing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' personalized genomic medicine ', ' genomic tools ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Data Science ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' patient variability ', ' patient variation ', ' variability between patients ', ' variation between patients ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Patient imaging ', ' ']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2021,97780,NY-13
"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,10136082,R01HL152066,"['Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Coagulation Disorders ', ' Coagulation Disorder ', ' Coagulopathy ', ' bleeding disorder ', ' clotting disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Hemophilia B ', ' Christmas Disease ', ' Factor IX Deficiency ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Factor IX ', ' Autoprothrombin II ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IX ', ' Christmas Factor ', ' Coagulation Factor IX ', ' EC 3.4.21.22 ', ' Factor IX Complex ', ' Factor IX Fraction ', ' Plasma Thromboplastin Component ', ' antihemophilic factor B ', ' thromboplastinogen B ', ' Factor XIa ', ' Activated Blood Coagulation Factor XI ', ' Activated Factor XI ', ' Coagulation Factor XIa ', ' Contact Activation Product ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Fluorescent Antibody Technique ', "" Coon's Technic "", "" Coon's Technique "", ' Fluorescent Antibody Technic ', ' Fluorescent Antinuclear Antibody Test ', ' Immunofluorescence Technic ', ' Immunofluorescence Technique ', ' fluorescent antibody ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hemophilia A ', ' Factor VIII Deficiency ', ' Hemophilia ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' carboxylation ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' mutant ', ' Structure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Cell surface ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' F9 gene ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' gain of function ', ' High-Throughput DNA Sequencing ', ' genetic information ', ' Genetic study ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical translation ', ' multiplex assay ', ' ']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2021,428767,WA-07
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,10192782,K08HG010061,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening ABSTRACT A simple method to comprehensively discover, characterize and identify structural variants arising from normal metabolic processes, as well as cell manipulations, would have great utility for gene editing, oncology, and rare disease research, among other applications. De Novo Directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH™) has been developed to efficiently screen thousands of cells for the presence of simple, complex, and heterogenous structural variants. In this project, Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, we propose K-Band™ dGH, an expanded dGH method. K-Band dGH is an in-situ hybridization method that utilizes high-density chromatid paints with bands of distinct spectra. A normal chromosome has a definitive pattern of bands, spectra and probe density. Structural variants are detected and identified via changes to the signal pattern. The proposed K-Band™ dGH method will provide the means for de novo discovery of balanced allelic translocations involving breakpoints at the same loci, inversions, and sister chromatid recombination and exchange events that are invisible to existing methods such as sequencing and aCGH. K-Band dGH will additionally characterize deletions, duplications, translocations, aneuploidy, polyploidy and more complex rearrangements. Structural variations cause a wide range of disorders, from rare diseases to cancers, and can be precise and definitive biomarkers. Also, because variations arise from the mis-repair of DNA double-strand breaks, unintended structural damage is an inevitable and potentially high-risk byproduct of genome editing. The potential of genome editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of diseases is widely recognized and the realization of the promise of such therapeutic approaches will rely on accurate confirmation of the presence and absence of potentially risky structural variants. For these reasons, comprehensive detection and characterization of structural variations is a necessary step toward understanding, diagnosing and ultimately precisely treating genetic diseases. From a homogeneous or heterogenous population of cells, and in a single experiment, K-Band dGH will identify cells with a structurally normal phenotype, detect all classes of structural variants, and locate the breakpoints of all simple and complex structural variants in each cell. With a limit of detection below 5Kb, K-Band dGH is an ideal method for determining the outcomes of gene editing, discovering the causes of undiagnosed rare diseases, profiling genomic structural instability and variability, and discovering and validating previously unknown structural genetic drivers of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern genomics, driven by the demands of personalized medicine, needs higher throughput, higher integrity, and improved resolution to enable the discovery of new disease drivers and in the development of safer gene therapies. Rapid, accurate, efficient characterization of structural variants and their associated risks is critical to the discovery of potential therapeutic avenues for undiagnosed and rare diseases, and to the development of engineered cellular therapies, including stem cells, CAR-T and other gene therapies leveraging gene-editing tools such as CRISPR. K-Band™ dGH, proposed in Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, will enable single-cell, single-experiment identification of clinically important structural variants that cannot be discovered or identified by NGS or other available methods with broad applicability in genome engineering R&D, target discovery and personalized therapy development.","Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases

"Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) disorders are among the world's most common monogenic diseases. Nearly 7% of the world’s population carry Hb gene variants. Sickle cell disease (SCD) arises when Hb mutations are inherited homozygously (HbSS) or paired with another β-globin gene mutation. Globally, an estimated 400,000 babies are born annually with SCD, and 70%-75% are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is estimated that 50-90% in SSA die by their 5th birthday, 70% of these deaths are preventable. Effective management of SCD involves early diagnosis, and genetic counselling, and, importantly, nationwide newborn screening (NBS). NBS programs utilizing centralized laboratories have dramatically reduced SCD mortality in high-resource countries. NBS requires sensitive detection of relatively low levels of Hb variants in the presence of high fetal Hb (HbF). Normal HbA and sickle HbS should be accurately identified in the presence of high levels (up to 90%) of HbF. The current gold standard for Hb variant testing is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which requires expensive equipment and reagents, highly trained personnel, and modern laboratories. In low- resource regions, very few centralized laboratories can perform costly Hb testing. Testing is not available to the large percentage of infants born outside of a major hospital or city. There is an unmet need for affordable, portable, easy-to-use, accurate, point-of-care (POC) tests to facilitate decentralized Hb testing to enable nationwide NBS programs. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed Hb electrophoresis as an essential in vitro diagnostic in low- and middle-income countries. We have developed a POC microchip electrophoresis Hb variant testing system, MicroChip Electrophoresis (MCE), under the product name “Gazelle Hb Variant” by Hemex Health, Inc. MCE reports Hb phenotype, Hb quantification (%Hb), and an interpretive statement showing genotype (such as SCD, Sickle Cell Trait, or Normal). MCE has been extensively validated for hemoglobinopathies, including SCD, hemoglobin E disease, and thalassemia. Newborns and infants below 6 weeks of age have very low concentrations of Hb variants other than Hb F which is high, therefore an improvement to lower the limit of detection (LoD) is needed to support NBS programs worldwide. By decreasing the LoD from the current 10% to 2%, newborns and infants can be screened with this affordable system. The innovation in this SBIR Phase I is the integration of multi-spectral imaging and machine learning based data analysis capability to MCE to develop MCE+ to accurately screen newborns for common Hb variants. We propose the following aims: Aim 1: Integrate multi-spectral imaging and machine learning algorithm into the MCE platform to enable identification and quantification of hemoglobin variants in newborns. Aim 2: Perform clinical testing of the MCE+ multi-spectral newborn screening system. Significance of this project is that MCE+ is the only affordable POC system for quantitative and objective hemoglobin variant testing that allows screening at birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Up to 50 to 90% of children born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in economically disadvantaged countries (over 400,000 per year) die before the age of five, although the WHO estimates that 70% could be saved through simple, cost-effective treatments.

"Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The availability of high-throughput, low-cost sequencing has transformed the landscape of biomedical research by dramatically expanding our capacity to interrogate the sequence of the human genome. Consequently, there has been an explosion of biomedical literature describing the role of specific genomic variants and their impact on human diseases. These advances are bringing sequencing into the clinic to shape clinical practice from the patient’s genomic content, a paradigm colloquially referred to as genomic or precision medicine. There remain many obstacles to fully realizing our potential in the era of precision medicine. Among them is a recognized need for robust, well-engineered systems that provide knowledge about genomic variants and their role in disease. Ideally, such systems would provide a comprehensive summary of all knowledge that is relevant to the patient’s unique genomic content. An early bottleneck to realizing precision medicine was that, despite the substantial literature and several established knowledgebases that define interactions between drugs and genes, querying across them was extremely challenging. In response to this need, the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb, dgidb.org) was developed. Through a combination of automated processing and manual curation, drug-gene interaction information was collected, structured, and connected (normalized) from these diverse sources of data and entered into a database with a user-friendly search interface and an application programming interface (API). However, linking drug and drug-gene interaction concepts across resources remains an extremely challenging task, and aggregated drug-gene interactions are also challenging to represent in a way that highlights the utility of the collected knowledge for precision medicine efforts. This proposal seeks to improve our ability to normalize and interpret drug-gene interactions corresponding to patient genomic variants. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims. First, the DGIdb normalization routines will be improved through incorporation of new content and features. Among these, the DGIdb will support collections of drugs, including combination therapies and drug classes. Also, the DGIdb will have new community submission and curation features, allowing users to incorporate new knowledge into the database. Second, the Variant Interpretation Aggregator database (VIAdb) will be created to normalize knowledge across several disparate sources focused on the clinical interpretations of genomic variants. The VIAdb will operate as a stand-alone web tool and API and will behave as a source of relevant interpretations to DGIdb. Finally, we will develop techniques for automated identification of drug-gene interactions and variant interpretation consensus to assist community curation efforts. If successful, this research will improve breadth and consistency of variant interpretations and drug-gene interactions for precision medicine efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will improve our ability to interpret genomic variations in human patients in support of precision medicine efforts. Specifically, it will provide web-based tools for identifying potential therapies that specifically target the patient’s individual genes or variants, and an assessment of the clinical actionability of those drugs.",Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants,10415312,R00HG010157,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Explosion ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Suggestion ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Level of Evidence ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' gene interaction ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug resource ', ' Data ', ' Resource Development ', ' The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center at the Vanderbilt University ', ' VICC ', ' Collection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' cancer type ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' tumor ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genomic variation ', ' clinically actionable ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' therapeutic biomarker ', ' therapeutic marker ', ' web-based tool ', ' Visualization ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NHGRI,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R00,2021,249000,OH-03
"Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening We propose to evaluate whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) as an approach for population screening of early-onset treatable recessively inherited conditions. Our analysis will be based on prior and additional work on the large, ancestrally diverse cohort of children constituting all 1,334 cases of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) diagnosed by tandem mass spectrometry screening in California over an 8.5 year period.  Our prior analysis found that WES lacked adequate sensitivity and specificity to replace current newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A screening-optimized DNA variant interpretation pipeline identified two known or likely pathogenic variants in most, but not all, affected cases. The pipeline was 88% sensitive and 98.4% specific, numbers too low to replace MS/MS. We found that 1/3 of known or likely pathogenic variants were novel, of which roughly 2/3 were missense. Adequate sensitivity and specificity therefore require accurate annotation of missense variants.  DNA variant annotation has focused on individual variants and is most applicable for dominant disorders for which pathogenicity is determined by a single variant. For recessive diseases, expression is determined by two variants on different chromosomes. We propose a new framework for disease prediction in recessive conditions, in which the bi-allelic variants, or diplotype, is used to assess pathogenicity. We will improve disease detection for autosomal recessive diseases through screening utilizing DNA sequencing by 1) improving interpretation of bi-allelic missense variants by using variant co-evolution, conservation, amino acid proximity and other features to derive a risk score, 2) considering both variants in recessive pathogenicity prediction, and 3) using the California newborn screening data set as a training set with a small number of positives for each disorder and a large number of controls (those cases positive for a different disease) to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict likelihood of disease. To address sensitivity, for 103 exome negative IEM cases from our data set we will fully interrogate the exome data, both for known IEM genes and also the entire exome to identify novel genes. Finally, for those remaining unsolved, we will perform WGS to identify additional causal variants. In so doing, we will also compare WES and WGS in terms of overall sensitivity and specificity for screening.  We anticipate that the proposed study will be a significant advance in assessing DNA sequencing as a newborn screening tool for those early-onset treatable diseases for which there is currently no screening test, leading to decreased death and disability. We propose to improve DNA sequencing as a newborn screening test by increasing the sensitivity and specificity to an acceptable level for those early-onset treatable disorders for which there is no alternative screening test. Given the large number of early-onset treatable conditions for which there is no test, or for which current testing continues to miss cases, DNA sequencing has the potential to have a large public health impact. Current newborn screening for multiple inborn errors of metabolism by tandem mass spectrometry is able to detect 40-50 disorders and is considered to be among the ten greatest public health successes of the first decade of the 21st century by the Centers for Disease Control; DNA based newborn screening could greatly increase the number of disorders identified and lead to timely and disease-specific interventions, thereby further decreasing death and disability due to treatable, early-onset recessive disorders.",Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening,10228509,R21HG011805,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' California ', ' Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Ammonia) ', ' CP Synthase I ', ' CPS I ', ' Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I ', ' Carbamoylphosphate Synthetase I ', ' carbamoylphosphate synthase ', ' carbon dioxide ammonia ligase ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Recessive Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Homocystinuria ', ' cystathionine synthase deficiency ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Inborn Errors of Metabolism ', ' Hereditary Metabolic Disorder ', ' inborn metabolism disorder ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' newborn screening ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Vitamin B6 ', ' Pyridoxin ', ' Pyridoxol ', ' VIT B6 ', ' Vitamin B 6 ', ' pyridoxine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Slice ', ' Characteristics ', ' early onset ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' screening ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' early screening ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Urea cycle disorders ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' ']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,323000,CA-12
"Functional genetic variants in substance use disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this study is to identify functional genetic variants that are associated with SUDs, and thereby contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying these devastating disorders. Our overall objectives are to (i) design and implement a series of experimental methods to assess the impact of genetic variants relevant to SUDs and related traits and computational models to predict the impact of additional variants, and (ii) establish a statistical genetics framework to more effectively identify additional genes that contribute to the disorders. This proposal builds upon our previous studies on the role of genomic variation in gene regulation and will generate new data to combine with existing multi-omics data and modeling. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Identify functional genetic variants that contribute to the risk for substance use disorders and related phenotypes by affecting gene regulation, using a series of high-throughput reporter assays to evaluate the impact of tens of thousands of non- coding variations in enhancers, promoters and 3’UTRs on gene expression in eight cell lines representing four major cell types in brain (neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). Variants with a modest association with substance use disorders and related traits will be selected from the GWAS catalog and experiments underway. Data on the initial large sets of variants will be used to predict, using machine learning approaches, the functional impact of additional regulatory variants. A large subset of the variants predicted to be functional will then be tested with follow-up HTRAs, and the predictive models refined based upon the data. 2. Identify genes whose expression changes contribute to the risk for SUDs. We will use Mendelian Randomization-based methods based on the data derived from Aim 1 plus GWAS data from the PGC and other large consortia to identify causal genes whose expression changes in specific cell types contribute to SUD-related phenotypes. Upon completion of these studies, we will have created a unique, accessible resource of SUD-associated genetic variants that regulate target gene expression in specific brain cell types. These genes can serve as high priority candidates for future functional and animal-based studies. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of high-throughput reporter assays and computational methods for prioritizing causal genetic variants and identifying driver genes that contribute to the risk for substance use disorders. This is directly relevant to the missions of NIH to improve the capability of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these devastating disorders.

"Genetics of oxycodone intake in a hybrid rat diversity panel. The steady rise in prescription opioids such as oxycodone has led to widespread abuse and deaths in the US. importance of drug pharmacokinetics in determining abuse potential, we have designed an oral operant rat self-administration (SA) procedure to model the pattern of drug intake of most human users/abusers of oxycodone, who initiate using oral tablets. Although genetic variants play important roles in susceptibility to opioid addiction, very limited data are available regarding specific genes and sequence variants that predispose to opioid addiction, and under what conditions. Given the We propose to use an innovative hybrid rat diversity panel (HRDP), which consists of 91 diverse rat genomes, to identify genetic variants influencing operant oxycodone intake in rats. The HRDP is unique in that it: 1) contains a high level of genetic diversity similar to that of human populations; 2) provides a way to control oxycodone exposure and to systematically study gene-by-environment and gene-by-drug interactions; and 3) integrates multi-omics ""addictome"" data: from genetics to epigenomics to brain connectomes to treatments. We have three aims: Aim 1: We will analyze whole genome sequencing data to define virtually all sequence variants that underlie heritable variations. De novo assemblies will be conducted using linked-reads data for selected high impact strains. Hi-C data (Dovetail Genomics) will be generated to further improve the quality of these assemblies. We will also generate RNA-seq data for key brain regions to obtain mechanistic insights into oxycodone intake. Aim 2: Using the HRDP (both sexes), we will phenotype oral oxycodone SA with a unique behavioral model. Rats will also be tested for sensitivity to pain, social behaviors, and anxiety-like traits - all signs of oxycodone withdrawal. Critically, we estimated the heritability (h2) of oxycodone intake in the range of 0.3 – 0.4. When using n=6/sex, the effective h2 is ~0.8 —sufficient for high precision mapping. Aim 3: We will use systems genetics methods to map and integrate behavioral phenotypes with sequence and transcriptome data. Both forward (QTL) and reverse (PheWAS) genetic methods will be used. We use new linear mixed models to map and test candidate genes with key cofactors using the GeneNetwork2 platform. Finally, we evaluate the translational relevance of candidate genes and biomarkers by comparison to GWAS cohorts and longitudinal reports of addiction in humans. Technical and conceptual advances that underlie this application are: new genomic methods combined with highly diverse rat populations allow us to quickly define novel gene variants that modulate key phases of opiate addiction. It is highly likely that a subset of variants and molecular networks we define will provide key components of a predictive framework linking sequence differences to human opioid addiction and potential treatments. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake. The U.S. has declared a national public health emergency to combat the current opioid crisis that is causing over 30,000 deaths per year. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake.

"Clinical Diagnostic Sequencing of Structural Variation ABSTRACT Emerging genomic medicine initiatives are poised to impact prenatal and pediatric diagnostics, including assessment of fetal structural anomalies (FSAs) from amniocentesis and the rapid adoption of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS). Indeed, the rapid decrease in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) costs and the improved sophistication of analytic genomics methods has brought prenatal screening to a critical inflection point. Ongoing studies find improved diagnostic yields from WGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) over conventional karyotype and microarray (CMA); however, the technical, analytical, and interpretative challenges presented by structural variants (SVs) continue to confound sequence-based diagnostics. The field lacks standardized methods to interpret SVs from WGS and WES, yet these variants underlie a significant fraction of prenatal diagnoses, particularly for high risk fetuses with multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs). Our clinical SV program was initially formed to nucleate expertise in technology and algorithm development, variant interpretation, maternal-fetal medicine, and large-scale references to explore the impact of high-resolution SV detection in prenatal diagnostics. This resubmission builds upon the methods, resources, and discoveries from those studies to establish uniform approaches to jointly discover and interpret SVs, initially from amniocentesis and ultimately using non-invasive methods. We will focus on MCAs as exemplars of genomic diagnostics in severe clinical referrals. The discoveries from our initial funding period collectively suggest several critical advances could transform prenatal screening and genetic diagnostics, and we directly address three major barriers to these advances in this renewal: (1) Diagnostic yields from WES in FSAs are highly variable due to inconsistent methods and limited sensitivity to capture SVs. Aim 1 will benchmark diagnostic yields from WGS in MCA cases using our standardized open-source pipelines. (2) The genes contributing to the most severe fetal anomalies in humans remain largely unknown, as studies of MCAs have mostly been restricted to small cohorts and low-resolution CMA methods. Aim 2 will aggregate these severe fetal anomalies and perform uniform variant detection and joint association analyses of short variants and SVs from WES and WGS in FSA trios across multiple consortia, which we will compare to population-scale aggregated controls. (3) NIPS is ultra-low resolution and fails to capture most causal variant classes underlying MCAs. Aim 3 will benchmark an innovative approach to detect coding mutations and SVs from cffDNA, comparing yields to current NIPS and amniocentesis as the standard-of-care. Our team will thus leverage complementary expertise, novel methods, and unique patient resources to advance routine genomic screening in prenatal diagnostics.

"Linking Variants to Multi-scale Phenotypes via a Synthesis of Subnetwork Inference and Deep Learning Project Summary The ability to accurately predict the effect of genetic variation on phenotypes at multiple scales would radically transform our ability to apply genomic technologies in order to understand human health and disease. This predictive ability would significantly improve the effectiveness of a broad spectrum of genomic analyses ranging from genome-wide association studies for common diseases to diagnostic odysseys searching for genetic causes of rare diseases. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a trainable approach for predicting the phenotypic impact of genetic variants. This approach will support predictions for a broad range of genetic variations, phenotypes, and biological contexts. It will incorporate and exploit mechanistic knowledge of pathways where available, but augment this pathway knowledge with learned models where it is not. This approach will consist of a synthesis of (i) methods that link genomic variants to their effect on expression or function of individual gene products, (ii) methods that link those relationships into the subnetworks involved in cellular responses of interest, (iii) machine-learning approaches that infer models pertaining to a variety of genotype-phenotype relations from large training sets. We will also develop and apply active learning algorithms to identify the most informative experiments for subsequent analysis by IGVF Consortium. Additionally, we will develop and apply a statistical framework for elucidating genetic modifiers, through probabilistic, network-informed inference of common variants identified in GWAS that modify the impact of rare variants implicated in sequencing-based association studies. Throughout the project, we will work closely with other IGVF Centers to guide experimental data collection, benchmark methods from across Centers, and contribute to the variant-element-phenotype catalog which will have broad applications by the community. Narrative Being able to characterize the impact of genetic variants on phenotypes is critical for interpreting the roles these variants play in human health and disease. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to predict the impact of genetic variants thereby boosting the effectiveness of genomic analyses ranging from genome-wide association studies for common diseases to diagnostic odysseys searching for genetic causes of rare diseases.",Linking Variants to Multi-scale Phenotypes via a Synthesis of Subnetwork Inference and Deep Learning,10297205,U01HG012039,"['Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Penetrance ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' molecular scale ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' genomic variation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' gene product ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U01,2021,324605,WI-02
"Multi-ethnic high-throughput study to identify novel non-HLA genetic contributors to mortality after blood and marrow transplantation Project Summary Blood and marrow transplant (BMT) is an effective cure for many life-threatening hematologic diseases. Survival after BMT has improved dramatically over the past two decades, however up to 40% of patients still die within one year after HLA-matched unrelated donor allogeneic BMT. This project will build upon our prior genome-wide (GWAS) and exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) involving ~2,900 patients named Determining the Influence of Susceptibility COnveying Variants Related to one-Year mortality after BMT (DISCOVeRY-BMT). Our GWAS identified several donor loci that significantly increased recipient’s risk of disease-related mortality (DRM) and donor-recipient genotype mismatches significantly increased risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM) in European Americans (EAs). Our ExWAS discovered a rare nonsynonymous coding variant, where a donor-recipient genotype mismatch correlated with TRM and additional novel genes (e.g. TEX38, OR51D1, and NT5E) correlated with overall survival, TRM and DRM. Our goal for this proposal is two-fold: to deepen our understanding of non-HLA genetic contributors to BMT mortality, and to build the clinical-genomic prognostic models to translate such understanding into clinical practice. The first goal will be fulfilled in two directions. 1) We will systematically survey both rare and common variants using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and meta- GWAS in EAs as well as under-studied diverse populations in an effort to bridge the BMT survival disparity between EAs, African Americans, Asians and Hispanics. Our prior ExWAS in EAs demonstrated the important roles played by rare coding variants in BMT mortality, however, only 2% of rare variants are in the exome array. Therefore, we will use WES to assay all exonic variants in 5,598 multi-ethnic donor-recipient pairs. As the variants/genes we identify are direct candidates for causality, functional validation will be performed to investigate such relationships. In parallel, we will perform the largest meta-GWAS of BMT mortality to date. Through our collaborations, we have assembled all BMT GWAS data available in the US (8,576 donor-recipient pairs including 1,978 minority pairs). 2) We will interrogate WES and GWAS data to further reveal the biological networks contributing to BMT mortality. To meet the second goal, we will leverage our unique and powerful GWAS resource to develop prognostic models to predict patients’ personalized mortality risk. This is the first study to use next-generation sequencing technology to analyze the contribution of non-HLA coding variants on post-BMT mortality. GWAS data on 8,576 donor-recipient pairs, of which 5,598 pairs also have WES data, will make this the largest genetic study ever undertaken, and provide a real opportunity to understand the genetics of BMT mortality across diverse populations. The prognostic models we develop will provide a valuable tool to help reduce BMT mortality and enhance donor-recipient matching in routine clinical practice. Importantly, the data generated by this project will be shared publicly to serve as a resource for additional research to improve survivorship after BMT and enhance the public investment in this project. Project Narrative This is the first study to use both next-generation sequencing and genome-wide association study data to analyze the contribution of non-HLA genetic variants to mortality after allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) for life-threatening hematologic cancers. Importantly, our study population includes multiple races and ethnicities which will allow us to investigate the role of genetics on BMT survival across diverse populations.

"Molecular determinants of pathogenicity in viral conjunctivitis ABSTRACT  Adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis is one of the most common conditions in all of medicine. Despite being a common cause of morbidity world-wide, there are no known host or pathogen factors that predict clinical outcomes in this condition. A recent, large, international clinical study of adenovirus-related conjunctivitis revealed that approximately 10% of patients suffer from long term visual loss. A limited deep DNA sequencing study of AdV D8 clinical samples conducted under our previous R21 (1R21EY027453) revealed unexpected sequence diversity in the viral genome, with approximately 600 sequence variants among 87 samples within the same hexon-defined molecular type. These variants assorted into three subtypes with different propensity to poor outcome. Remarkably, using machine learning approaches, we found we were able to predict one critical outcome – the development of subepithelial infiltrates – from knowledge of the viral sequence alone.  Our previous study sequenced samples from the placebo arm of the NVC-422 clinical trial. We have an additional 157 AdV D8 samples that have not been sequenced. In Aim 1 we propose sequencing the adenovirus of these samples in order to a.) further characterize the sequence diversity of AdV D8 and b.) validate our machine learning method for predicting development of subeptithelial infiltrates While AdV D8 was the most prevalent cause of AKC in our study worldwide, unexpectedly we found in the United States that AdV E4 was the most prevalent type. In Aim 2, we propose fully sequencing all 36 samples in the study from type E4, as well as 23 samples from type B3, 9 samples from D19, and a total of 35 samples distributed between type D53, D56, and D64 to determine their molecular diversity, and to apply the same machine learning methods to this set of samples to determine if outcomes can be predicted from viral sequence variants for these types as for AdVD8. The results of these studies will expand our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of viral conjunctivitis, and will provide biomarkers for predicting outcomes from this condition. These advances will facilitate future efforts toward developing therapies for this common condition. NARRATIVE Adenovirus-related conjunctivitis, one of the most common conditions in all of medicine, can lead to a long- term visual loss in a significant portion of patients. We propose to use next generation DNA sequencing to catalog the molecular variants of adenovirus, determine their association with outcomes, and determine the molecular strains of virus associated with poor clinical outcomes.",Molecular determinants of pathogenicity in viral conjunctivitis,10313229,R21EY033174,"['Adenoviruses ', ' Adenoviridae ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' Conjunctivitis ', ' Viral Conjunctivitis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Keratoconjunctivitis ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Patients ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Shotguns ', ' shot gun ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' Virus ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Techniques ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Viral ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Swab ', ' genome sequencing ', ' D53 ', ' TPD52L1 ', ' TPD52L1 gene ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Viral Pathogenesis ', ' virus pathogenesis ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' ocular surface ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' arm ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' viral genomics ', ' virus genomics ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,220625,WA-07
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,10085248,R01GM125639,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' success ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' screening ', ' biophysical model ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' Genetic study ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' human interactome ', ' random forest ', ' data pipeline ', ' computational pipelines ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,563248,NY-23
"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes.

"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production.

"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases.

"Comprehensive characterization of variants underlying heart and blood diseases with CRISPR base editing Project Summary How genomic variation influences cellular function is a fundamental problem with tremendous importance for human disease. While it has traditionally been difficult to study the effects of specific sequence variants in an experimentally controlled manner, precise genome editing technologies such as CRISPR base editing enable “writing” of trait-associated variants to cells to unravel their function. In this proposal, we will perform multi-modal genome editing-based functional characterization of a total of 72,000 genomic variants associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and hematological traits. CVD and blood traits are uniquely suited to functional dissection because cardiovascular (coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia) and blood traits have among the best-powered multi-ethnic GWAS of any traits, and a substantial component of trait variability can be captured in cellular assays that can be scaled to perform high-throughput screening. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of world-class experts to provide a generalizable pipeline to unravel the functional impact of CVD and blood trait variants by integrating: (1) rich and ancestry-diverse human genetic discoveries, (2) broadly targetable CRISPR base editors and efficient delivery to primary human cells, (3) high-content assays to profile phenotypes at the levels of chromatin, gene expression and cellular function, and (4) computational methods to design, interpret, visualize, and share experimental results. In Aim 1, we will employ a robust, three-tiered variant prioritization scheme that incorporates evidence for disease association from large, multi-ethnic GWAS as well as probability of causality to nominate variants for functional assessment. Through this scheme, we will select variants associated with red blood cell and neutrophil traits, coronary artery disease, blood pressure, and HDL and LDL cholesterol that span a range of allelic frequencies and likely causality to test in high-throughput cellular assays. In Aim 2, we will perform systematic cellular phenotype-based screens using base editors to install candidate variants as well as CRISPR epigenetic inhibition and activation to explore variant-containing regulatory elements. We will use eight established, scalable cellular phenotypic readouts, each of which will enable us to assess which of 12,000 variants and variant-centered elements alter CVD and blood trait-associated cellular phenotypes. We will additionally employ a high-throughput, genome-integrated chromatin accessibility assay to assess which variants alter chromatin accessibility in trait-relevant cell lines. We will follow up with targeted single cell RNA-seq of 5,600 variants in primary cells from donors of different sex and ethnicity. In Aim 3, we will produce a catalog of validated variants and their association with phenotypes for each of the proposed screens. We will collaborate with other IGVF groups to utilize these data to optimize models that predict functional variants, regulatory elements and disease-causing biological mechanisms, ultimately leading to more complete understanding of the genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular and blood disease risk. Project Narrative Genetic variation dictates an individual’s risk of developing common ailments such as heart and blood diseases. Traditionally, it has been difficult to determine which of the millions of sequence variants influence disease susceptibility due to a lack of technologies that enable the causal assignment of genetic variants at scale. To address this unmet need, we will develop a generalizable pipeline that leverages technological breakthroughs in precise genome editing to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation on heart and blood disease risk, offering a rich catalog of the consequences of thousands of disease-associated variants that will be of broad utility to the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF)

"Massively-parallel functional interrogation of genetic variation in LGMD-associated sarcoglycan genes PROJECT SUMMARY Mutations in α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan cause sarcoglyanopathies, a subset of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) with devastating effects for patients including muscle wasting, progressive weakness, degeneration of skeletal muscle and often premature death. Accurately diagnosing patients with LGMD before symptom onset or early in the course of the disease has the potential to enable the use of preventative gene therapy or other therapeutics and in the majority of cases can only be done in presymptomatic cases through genetic testing. When a new DNA variant in one of these genes is observed in a patient, however, there is often insufficient evidence to classify it as pathogenic. Within this study, we will use a new approach to express and characterize every possible missense variant in the SGCA, SGCB, SGCG and SGCD genes to advance our understanding of sarcoglycan biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the SGC genes, and advance LGMD care and treatments. We will employ deep mutational scanning, a method for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. We will express a library of all possible SGC missense variants in cultured human cells and measure the effect of each by exploiting a simple but robust characteristic of pathogenic SGC gene variants, disruption of proper protein trafficking. Our two aims are: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible SGC missense variant on SGC protein trafficking and membrane localization, and 2) Predict and validate the pathogenicity of every possible SGC missense variant by integrating multiple functional assays from Aim 1 to create a pathogenicity score for each variant and by confirming variant predictions biochemically using tissue samples from LGMD patients with VUS. These aims will reveal how each possible missense variant in SGC genes impact expression, transport, function or interaction with other SGC proteins. The functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of SGC variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand sarcoglycan biology, improve the clinical translation of sarcoglycanopathies and LGMD using genetic information, and inform new treatments. The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in a subset of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in the sarcoglycan genes SGCA, SGCB, SGCD and SGCG. We propose to use an integrated experimental and computational approach that combines multiple high-throughput assays of protein trafficking and function and machine-learning to generate pathogenicity predictions for all possible single- nucleotide variants in these SGC genes and then to validate our predictions in primary tissue samples from patients with SGC variants.",Massively-parallel functional interrogation of genetic variation in LGMD-associated sarcoglycan genes,10193457,R21AR078942,"['Archives ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Registries ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Saliva ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' gamma Sarcoglycan ', ' γ-Sarcoglycan ', ' Therapeutic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' δ-Sarcoglycan ', ' delta Sarcoglycan ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Protein Trafficking ', ' protein transport ', ' limb-girdle muscular weakness and atrophy ', ' limb-girdle syndrome ', ' myopathic limb-girdle syndrome ', ' Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' referral center ', ' biomedical referral center ', ' GUCY ', ' Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase ', ' nitric oxide receptor ', ' nitric oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclase ', ' sGC protein ', ' Soluble Guanylate Cyclase ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Sarcoglycans ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' protein function ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' genetic information ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' clinical translation ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' ClinVar ', ' ']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,207900,MO-01
"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind

Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases.

"Identifying causal genetic variants and molecular mechanisms impacting mental health Identifying how genetic variation leads to neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders provides new means to study, predict, prevent and treat disease. Identifying the immediate molecular consequences of disease- associated genetic variation has necessitated the development of large-scale, multi-tissue functional genomic resources. Projects such as GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics Project and PsychENCODE have combined molecular QTL mapping and epigenomic maps in bulk tissues to interpret various disease-associated genetic variants. However, few colocalizations between molecular QTLs and traits have been robustly identified and few causal variants mapped. As tissues like the brain constitute 100s of cell-types, we hypothesize that existing maps may mask the contributions of disease-associated variation in less-abundant cell types. One extremely powerful approach to identify cell-type specific molecular effects and their relationship to genetic diseases is through application of chromatin accessibility data – these data both allow inference of causal cell types and provide base level resolution gene regulation. Our team has considerable expertise in connecting GWAS to molecular functions and predicting causal variants through use of chromatin accessibility data. We have additionally recently collaborated to generate a comprehensive, multi-individual map single cell ATAC- seq map (scATAC-seq) of six different brain regions to detect causal cell types and predict causal variants. This work has been recently demonstrated in our fine-mapping study of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Corces et al, bioRxiv, 2020) but has not been systematically applied to mental health disorders. We propose to develop statistical genetics and machine learning approaches that advance the use of scATAC-seq data to connecting mental health GWAS loci to specific cell types, mechanisms and causal variants. In Aim 1, we will assemble a pipeline that leverages region and cell type-specific scATAC-seq data to identify pathological cell types for 100s of mental health and brain-related traits. We will also enhance the detection of cell-type specific molecular mechanisms by extending and applying a novel GWAS/QTL colocalization approach. Throughout these activities, variants will be validated using massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA). In Aim 2, we will develop sophisticated machine learning models that learn regulatory grammars and score variants across the allele frequency spectrum. Predicted causal variants in GWAS loci will be further assessed with MPRAs in Aim 1 and applied in Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate how improved detection of causal variants using our single-cell informed models aids transferability of polygenic risk scores across populations.  We will provide open resources and reproducible computational methods and pipelines that integrate single cell chromatin accessibility data from multiple brain regions. This will allow detection cell-type specific genetic effects and pathological cell types in mental health GWAS, establish robust causal links between variants, genes and disease, and improve prediction of disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Identifying causal genetic variants in mental health disease is a major challenge limiting interpretation of disease biology, prediction of risk and development of therapies.

"Computational modeling of genetic variations by multi-omics integration to decipher personal genome Computational modeling of genetic variations by multi-omics integration to decipher personal genome A person’s genome typically contains millions of genetic variants. Understanding these variants by assessing their functional impact on a person’s phenotype, is currently of great interest in human genetics and precision medicine. Though Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) studies have successfully identified variants associated with traits or molecular phenotypes, most of them are in noncoding regions and hampered by linkage disequilibrium, making the identification and interpretation of casual variants difficult. Moreover, most of these discoveries are common variants, however, rare and individual-specific variants in personal genome are underexplored. Understanding these variants will not only explain the missing heritability from GWAS but also improve the precision medicine. Recently, the advent and popularity of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and paired multi-omics functional assays provide an unprecedented opportunity to identify rare and individual-specific casual variants. However, the sample sizes of most WGS studies are modest compared to GWAS, making the WGS analysis particularly challenging. Nevertheless, statistical and computational methods for analyzing WGS are underdeveloped. Given these challenges and my unique multi- disciplinary training, the overall goals of my research program are to develop a novel class of machine learning, statistical and system biology approaches for the identification, prioritization and interpretation of noncoding variants by integrating GWAS, WGS and multi-omics functional assays, which will empower precision medicine by identifying individualized biomarkers for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, in the next five years, my lab will (i) develop a novel transfer learning approach to improve the prediction of noncoding casual variants using multi-dimensional omics features (ii) develop a multi-omics integrated omnibus scan test to improve the identification of rare casual variants from whole-genome sequencing data (iii) develop an integrative computational framework for scoring impact of noncoding variants in personal genome (iv) develop a novel class of multi-trait methods to improve phenotype prediction using whole-genome genetic variations. In the meantime, supported by Indiana University Precision Health Initiative, we will apply the methodologies to different studies from Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Center and Indiana Multiple Myeloma Biobank for novel scientific findings. We will work close with collaborated geneticists and clinician-scientists to interpret the discoveries. Importantly, we will work with experimental labs to validate the findings. In line with our previous work, we will continue to make all developed methods into open-source software tools that are accessible and useful to the biomedical research community.

"New quantitative approaches to interpret variant pathogenicity Project Summary Insufficient knowledge and throughput to interpret pathogenicity of genetic variants identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) is a major bottleneck for genomic medicine implementation. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines identify high-confidence pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants but are limited in scalability. Many variants are classified as variants of uncertain significance by the ACMG/AMP guidelines without an indication of which of these variants are more or less likely to be pathogenic, leading to inappropriate medical treatment. Hence, I propose to develop standardized quantitative approaches to improve our ability to interpret genomic variations accurately at high-throughput. In-silico tools are commonly used to assign variant pathogenicity based on conservation, but their predictive accuracy is limited. The current methods have not been calibrated across genes, and the same pathogenicity score does not infer the same likelihood of pathogenicity across different genes. In this proposal, 1) I aim to recalibrate the pathogenicity scores incorporating gene-specific features making the pathogenicity scores more comparable across genes, and improve the accuracy of pathogenicity predictions using advanced deep neural network models and functional data from saturation mutagenesis studies. 2) I aim to quantify the ACMG/AMP variant classification and provide probability of variant pathogenicity for clinically relevant genes using advanced supervised learning and leveraging a large case- control cohort. The improved computational predictions (Aim 1) will refine variant prioritization for downstream analyses and strengthen the computational evidence used in the ACMG/AMP guidelines. The estimated probability of variant pathogenicity based on ACMG/AMP guideline (Aim 2) will improve communication between laboratories, health care providers and patients about genetic test results.

"Predictive Modeling of the Functional and Phenotypic Impacts of Genetic Variants PROJECT SUMMARY Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated tens of thousands of common variants with human diseases and traits. The rapid expansion of Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) studies and biobanks offer great potential to understand the physiologic and pathophysiologic associations of both common and rare variants. The IGVF Consortium aims to systematically study the functional and phenotypic effects of genomic variation; it is not, however, feasible to experimentally characterize the vast number of candidate variants of interest. Computational models which can accurately predict the context-specific effects of variants are essential in designing targeted research. We propose an approach anchored on a framework of high-confidence regulatory elements (REs), from which we will develop methods to learn RE-gene links, perform rare variant association tests, and finemap causal common and rare variants. We aim to make all our results, methods, and tools available to the community through a public portal and the NHGRI and NHLBI Data Commons. Our proposal has four aims: (1) Develop a core framework of REs from open chromatin regions on which to anchor our models, improving on past approaches by producing higher-resolution predictions of functional base-pairs, producing novel RE subclassifications using functional characterization datasets from IGVF and other sources, and harnessing single-cell datasets to delineate lineage- and stimulus-specific elements. (2) Use this framework to predict the roles of variants in molecular phenotypes, specifically gene expression and cellular response to stimuli. We will build statistical and machine-learning methods to predict context-specific links between REs and their target genes, using three-dimensional conformation data produced by the IGVF Consortium and external sources. We will apply this method across many cell types and perform feature selection to build a catalog of high-confidence RE-gene links and regulatory networks. (3) Develop statistical methods to perform cell type-specific rare variant association tests (cellSTAAR) in WGS studies, and a latent variable model to prioritize candidate functional variants for traits and diseases, using results from Aims 1 and 2. We will apply these methods to analyze various metabolic, immune-mediated, and psychiatric disorders in the multi-ethnic WGS data of the NHLBI Trans-Omic Precision Medicine Program (TOPMed) and the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) to identify candidate causal disease-associated variants. (4) Make all the results publicly available by substantially expanding the FAVOR Portal to include whole genome variant functional annotations of all three billion genomic positions as well as cell type-specific annotations. We will implement both FAVOR and cellSTAAR in the Data Commons AnVIL (NHGRI) and BioData Catalyst (NHLBI) so researchers may use them for analysis of new datasets in a scalable cloud computing environment. We will work closely with other centers and the Data Analysis Coordinating Center (DACC) of the IGVF on joint analyses and building the IGVF Variant Catalog. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists have been pinpointing tens of thousands of positions in the human genome which may influence disease. In order to apply this knowledge to improve treatment options and preventative medicine, however, we need to have a better understanding of how these regions function and where in the body they are active.

"Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development Project Summary A deep understanding of gene regulation and function during craniofacial development is not only important for our biological knowledge, but also critical to identify causal variants and genes underlying many dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases. Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and DOC diseases. These datasets are highly heterogeneous (e.g. platforms, species, tissues, developmental stages) and cross-species (e.g. human and mouse), requiring novel analytical approaches for decoding genetic regulation, molecular function, and cellular maps in craniofacial development. Critically, because of practical unavailability of human embryonic craniofacial tissue, there is a big gap between the abundant -omics and functional studies in murine craniofacial development and large-scale human genetic studies of DOC diseases. In this proposal, we combine machine learning, genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), complex disease genetics, developmental biology to design novel methods aiming to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1. To develop a deep learning method, DeepFace, for characterizing and prioritizing genetic variants and regulation during craniofacial development. DeepFace is designed to decipher functional impact of noncoding variants and will be the first deep learning method to integrate cross-species functional features in craniofacial development. We will validate DeepFace by using data from genome-wide association studies (15 datasets) and case-parent trio-based whole genome sequencing (3 datasets) of orofacial clefts (OFCs). This validation will identify potential causal variants, both common and de novo mutations, in OFCs. Aim 2. To develop deep learning methods for time-series scRNA-seq data analysis in craniofacial development. We will develop novel algorithms including TTNNet for integrating time-series scRNA- seq data and DrivAER for tracing developmental trajectories and identifying driving transcription factors in craniofacial development. We will validate the methods using scRNA-seq datasets from the FaceBase consortium and to-be-generated data for mouse palate formation. Aim 3. To experimentally validate and characterize the top ranked novel mutations (Aim 1) and regulators (Aim 2). Building on our previous studies, strong preliminary data and highly experienced team, this proposal is timely to develop machine learning methods to effectively address the current gap between the genomics studies in murine craniofacial development and human genetic studies of orofacial clefts. The successful completion will provide 1) the NIDCR research community a suite of novel methods and analytical tools for genomic/epigenomic/scRNA-seq data, and 2) the mechanistic assessment on the mutations/genes and transcriptional regulators that are potentially involved in OFCs and related craniofacial diseases. Project Narrative Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases; however, these data are highly heterogeneous, limiting the analysis for the understanding of DOC biology and discovery of causal mutations and regulators in DOC diseases.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,10058828,R01DC012049,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', '

"Functional Genetics Approaches to Investigate Human Evolution Analyses of human and chimpanzee genomes have catalogued the single-nucleotide and structural variants that have emerged since humans diverged from nonhuman primates. Nearly all of these genetic variants remain functionally uncharacterized. Contained within these genetic variants are alterations to cis-regulatory elements, protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs, gene copy number, repetitive elements, and other genomic features that underlie phenotypic differences between humans and nonhuman primates. Because it is difficult to predict how genomic differences within the hominid lineage contribute to phenotypic differences, there is a critical need for high-throughput, systematic approaches to interrogate functional genetic variation. Therefore, I seek to develop a quantitative genome-scale platform for identifying the phenotypic consequences of human-specific evolutionary mutations at a cellular and molecular level. To accomplish this objective, I will combine advances in chimpanzee pluripotent stem cell-derived models with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), single-cell RNAsequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq). This project is of great  public health relevance because it will use genetic and molecular techniques to link evolved human-specific genetic variants to key cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, differentiation, gene expression, and chromatin state regulation. In Aim 1, I will functionally investigate thousands of human-specific deletions (hDels), structural variants that are lost in the human lineage, using a genome-scale CRISPRi screening approach in chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs). I hypothesize that hDels contain celltype specific cis-regulatory elements that modify robust cellular proliferation. In Aim 2, I will map cis-regulatory elements contained within hDels to their target genes using scATAC-seq of embryonic rhesus macaque telencephalon followed by CRISPRi and scRNA-seq in chimpanzee NPCs. I hypothesize that hDel-containing cis-regulatory elements control genes involved in cellular division, apoptosis, and migration. In addition to Dr. Pollen’s expertise in comparative genomics and single-cell transcriptomics and Dr. Katherine Pollard’s expertise in theoretical population genetics and machine learning, our ongoing local collaborations with Dr. Martin Kampmann (CRISPR-Cas systems), Dr. Hani Goodarzi (computational and statistical methods), and Dr. Nadav Ahituv (cis-regulatory evolution), support the feasibility of this project.

"Deciphering the role of noncoding variation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the brain and spinal cord mediated largely by pathogenic T cell responses to myelin antigens, resulting in demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS). Myelin-reactive T cells are also crucial for induction of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Studies of MS and EAE implicate CD4 T helper (Th) cells in disease pathogenesis, including pro-inflammatory Th17 and Th1 cells. In this regard, the disease-promoting ability of these T cell subsets stems from both their capacity to target and infiltrate the CNS and their pro-inflammatory effector function. An interplay between genetic and environmental factors is implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. However, despite a wealth of genome wide association data (GWAS) data revealing a strong genetic contribution to MS, it has been challenging to identify the bona fide disease-promoting gene target(s) of many risk-associated variants, and the cellular compartment in which they contribute to dysregulation. In preliminary work, we have applied global genomics approaches to map MS-associated noncoding risk variants to their long-range target gene by physically capturing enhancer-promoter interactions. These MS-implicated genes were further prioritized based on dysregulated expression signatures in pathogenic Th17 cells derived from MS patients. Using this approach, we have identified putative regulatory MS variants and gene targets that control CD4 T cell function in MS that are the basis of this application. We hypothesize that identifying noncoding variants that alter the regulatory function of cis elements controlling proinflammatory T cells will provide novel mechanistic insights into the underlying etiology governing the development of MS. Here, we propose an integrative strategy to prioritize and validate causal genetic variants in MS pathogenesis. The goal of Aim 1 is to determine the contribution of noncoding risk variants to CD4 T cell gene regulation. In particular, we will employ a combination of high-throughput regulatory reporter assays and machine learning approaches to identify SNPs with regulatory function in primary human CD4 T cells. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which these regulatory variants contribute to altered T cell function and pathogenicity in MS. Complementary CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic and epigenetic perturbations will define the enhancer context of risk alleles and delineate bona fide regulatory gene targets of regulatory risk variants. Moving from genotype to phenotype, we will define true causal variants that contribute to disease etiology in the context of an intact immune system using genetic interventions that model conserved risk variants in mice. Together, the proposed experiments will advance our understanding of the both the genetic and cellular mechanisms governing Th17 cell pathogenicity in MS and discover new loci with unknown functions in disease etiology. Relevance Statement Recent years have witnessed an explosion of information derived from genome wide association studies (GWAS) linking genetic variation with increased risk for diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To date, little mechanistic insight has been gleaned from the majority of risk-associated variants, a challenge reflecting their primary localization to non-coding regulatory regions of the genome. The proposed work will capitalize on emerging genomics approaches to prioritize lineage-relevant MS risk variants, determine their mechanism of action in contributing to the pathogenesis of MS, and as such, provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting MS.",Deciphering the role of noncoding variation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis,10298904,R01AI156186,"['Antigens ', '

"Supporting IGVF by modeling genetics, function, and phenotype with machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY Leveraging the power of the human genome to understand the risks, causes, and treatments of human dis- ease remains a grand challenge for all of biology and medicine. While sequencing costs have plummeted, and clinical implementation has become commonplace, interpreting human genomes remains a highly challenging task. It is our hypothesis that understanding the function of the genome and its products at a molecular, tissue, and phenotypic level using advanced machine learning will help unlock the door to better interpretation for sci- entific discovery and better clinical outcomes based on genomic medicine. To that end, our team has spent the past two decades working to develop computational models of biology, to predict how those models are perturbed through changes in the genome, and to use those perturbations to model phenotype and disease. We have had many research outputs in this area, having developed and published a number of widely used methods that predict biochemical and phenotypic changes caused by genetic variants to infer phenotype and pathogenicity. However, we believe that there is a coming convergence between the variability in clinical inter- pretation, high-throughput biotechnology assays, and modern machine learning methodology that will result in more accurate clinical assessments and improved clinical care. Therefore, in this ambitious proposal, we are addressing important questions in variant and genome interpretation consistent with this view and the mission of the IGVF Consortium. Our major goals include (1) developing advanced semi-supervised approaches to predict variants that disrupt molecular function and/or are capable of altering phenotypes; (2) identifying in- formative assays, variants, and genes to automate experimental design with an emphasis on resource alloca- tion and reduction of ascertainment bias in the Consortium; and (3) developing machine learning approaches to integrate these models into a workflow of the IGVF Consortium and enable the interaction between compu- tation and experiment in order to catalyze advances in both genetic variant interpretation and predictive model development. PROJECT NARRATIVE We are developing advanced machine learning approaches and tools for understanding the link between mo- lecular function and phenotype and to guide experimental data collection within the IGVF Consortium. These tools will assist in determining whether and how the observed differences on a human genome give rise to a risk of a disease or other condition of clinical interest. Our methods are distributable on the internet and will be made widely available.","Supporting IGVF by modeling genetics, function, and phenotype with machine learning",10297060,U01HG012022,"['Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Paper ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' trait ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' assay development ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' model development ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' human disease ', ' clinical care ', ' biological systems ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' genomic variation ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' predictive tools ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical implementation ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHGRI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,356264,MA-07
"Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Over one in one hundred infants born are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which can cause a host of debilitating symptoms including early-onset seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Application of whole exome/genome sequencing to examine NDD has revealed many disease-causing variations, but in a substantial proportion of cases the genetic cause remains undetermined. The analysis of deep-intronic non-coding variants has provided diagnosis when coding variation cannot be implicated in disease. For example, intronic variants in the “20N” poison exon of SCN1A results in loss of function, causing Dravet Syndrome, an NDD causing prolonged seizures in the first year of life. Poison exons are a mechanism of gene regulation whereby a premature termination codon caused by inclusion of the poison exon induces nonsense- mediated decay of the mRNA transcript. Preliminary analysis has shown that poison exon inclusion (PEI) in SCN1A and SCN8A decreases during embryonic brain development, inversely proportional to total RNA expression. The brain is a hotbed of alternative splicing during early neuronal development therefore it is plausible, if not probable that novel poison exons remain uncharacterized. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that PEI is a mechanism to differentiallyregulate gene expression during earlyneuronal development, and intronic variants affecting PEI in genes of developmental importance contribute to disease phenotype. In Aim 1, the sodium and calcium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit families will be assessed to detect and characterize novel poison exons. Known and novel PEI will then be determined in the developing brain using publicly available RNA-seq experiments. In Aim 2 this analysis will be scaled up over 100-fold to detect and assess PEI in over 3000 genes associated with NDD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the developing brain and the driving forces of PEI evolution will be assessed. Comparative analysis of poison exons will be conducted using k-means hierarchical clustering and unsupervised random forest machine learning methodologies to determine prime biological factors driving PEI utilization. In Aim 3, intronic variants will be analyzed in probands of NDD and ASD in regions of known and hypothetical PEI and the affect these variants have on disease phenotype will be computationally assessed. These experiments will reveal new insights into alternative splicing in the developing brain and provide potential genetic explanation of currently unknown NDD disease phenotype. The research will be conducted at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, which allows developing scientists to hone skills in a dynamic, hands-on environment with supplemental training courses as necessary. Besides the research outlined in the proposal, training will include courses in conduct of responsible research, advanced biostatistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and wet lab techniques next to personal development to improve oral and written communication and presentation skills as well as time management. Project Narrative Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) are debilitating early-onset diseases estimated to affect 1-2% of the population, and the cause of a substantial proportion of these cases remains unknown. Our lab has recently implicated causative variants in poison exons, a cryptic alternatively spliced exon causing transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay. The proposed research aims to examine the role of poison exon inclusion in the regulation of genes associated with NDD during neurological development, providing insights into alternative splicing in the brain and provide essential information for diagnosis and potential therapeutics for patients with NDD.",Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and

"Personalized Structural Biology: Enabling Exome Interpretation in Undiagnosed Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Our long-term goal is to establish personalized structural biology – a precision medicine approach for inter- preting clinical sequencing data by jointly modeling all mutations in a patient’s proteome in the context of protein 3D structures, known human genetic variation, and other relevant data. In this project, we will develop the com- putational tools needed to integrate the wealth of available genetic variation data with cutting edge algorithms for efficiently modeling mutations to human protein structures and accurately quantifying their specific functional effects. This will provide a rich characterization of healthy and diseased proteomes and the means to generate actionable hypotheses about the effects of variants of unknown significance in individual patients. To demon- strate the power and relevance of this approach, we will apply it to facilitate variant interpretation in individuals in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). We will then collaborate to validate our predictions.  Our central hypothesis is that achieving the full promise of precision medicine requires the interpretation of a patient’s genetic variants in their 3D structural contexts and the integration of structural and clinical infor- mation. Patient genome interpretation is a major roadblock to fully realizing the transformative potential of per- sonalized medicine in the clinic. Current approaches for characterizing protein-coding variants of unknown sig- nificance have several shortcomings that limit their practical utility. First, they are not personalized; most are trained en masse on databases of known mutations across thousands of individuals. Thus, they are subject to ascertainment bias and ignore the background of other variants present in the individual. Second, most fail to provide specific biologically interpretable and thus therapeutically actionable predictions of a mutation’s effects beyond “benign” or “pathogenic”. Third, they are not stable and similar methods often disagree. Fourth, most are unable to interpret multi-base insertions and deletions. As a result and most importantly, current methods often give insufficient guidance to clinicians and fail to personalize next steps of treatment.  Computational methods for modeling the effects of mutations on protein structures are now sufficiently fast and accurate to provide a solution to these challenges. Building on our expertise in analyzing the effects of mutations and modeling protein structures, the following aims establish a computational framework for interpre- tation of exonic variants that is personalized, clinically relevant, accurate, and applicable to all mutation types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying the genetic variants responsible for patient phenotypes is challenging, especially for rare diseases. We will develop algorithms for interpreting variants of unknown clinical significance by modeling the effects of all variants in a patient on protein 3D structures, integrating structural features with machine learning, and using systems biology to identify functional interactions between variants. In collaboration with the Undiagnosed Dis- eases Network, we will develop and validate mechanistic hypotheses about the genetic basis for disease and establish a foundation for personalized treatments that reflect patients’ unique genetic backgrounds.",Personalized Structural Biology: Enabling Exome Interpretation in Undiagnosed Diseases,10211423,R01LM013434,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Generations ', ' Set protein ', ' HLA-DR Associated Protein II ', ' IGAAD ', ' Inhibitor of GZMA-Activated DNase ', ' Phosphatase 2A Inhibitor I2PP2A ', ' SET Translocation Inhibitor-2 of Protein Phosphatase-2A ', ' Template Activating Factor I Beta ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' protein structure function ', ' structural biology ', ' success ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Structure ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Proteome ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Treatment Step ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Genetic Annotation ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' indel ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Network-based ', ' treatment strategy ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' genetic information ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' clinical sequencing ', ' individual patient ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' algorithm development ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354521,TN-05
"The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms Project Summary  Recent years have witnessed the development of large research projects that involve  genotyping hundreds of thousands of individuals, on which we have available detailed medical records. Examples include the All of us research project, the Million Veteran Program, and the UKBiobank resource. Often, whole-genome sequencing data is also available for a substantial fraction of the individuals. These large samples, with their precise genotypic and phenotypic information, give us the opportunity to bring our understanding of the relations between genetic variation and traits of medical interest to the next level.  While the initial small sample sizes available for genome wide association studies (GWAS) motivated analyses that were approximative in nature, we are now in the position to probe more closely the genetic causal mechanisms underlying medically relevant phenotypes. We can aspire to distinguish variants that have causal effects from those that are associated because of linkage disequilibrium or population structure. Indeed, we need to pay even greater attention to the implications of hidden confounders: even small effects become significant when sample sizes are large enough.  Increasing the resolution with which we can describe causal mechanisms will result in the identification of clearer targets for drug development. It will also improve the precision of  personalized risk evaluations based on genotypes: if we can construct risk scores using variants that are truly causal, their performance will remain solid across ethnicities and environmental exposures.  To zoom in on genetic variants with causal effects, this project will leverage a set of new statistical methodologies that the investigators have recently introduced. These new approaches are remarkably flexible, in that they do not rely on specific assumptions of how phenotypes are linked to genetic variants. Indeed, they allow researchers to capitalize on powerful machine learning algorithms and, crucially, equip their results with precise replicability guarantees.  We have assembled a diverse and complementary team, including experts in statistical  genomics, methodological statistics and computer science, with a strong record both of software development and genetic data analysis. A postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students will contribute to the research program, and the interdisciplinary training they will acquire in  statistics, computation and genetics will add another substantial benefit. Personalized medicine strives to provide treatments that are fine-tuned to the patients, aware both of the specificity of their diseases as well as of the individuals’ background characteristics. In order to achieve this promise, identifying those genes and mutations that influence the medically relevant traits is an important tool: it gives us the opportunity to understand the biological pathways involved, inspires drug development, informs treatment and counseling and facilitates prevention. The proposed research would develop new methods of statistical analysis to harness the information contained in large datasets, increasing our ability to distinguish the genetic mutations that directly impact phenotypes, from those that are merely correlated with traits of interest.",The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms,10291186,R56HG010812,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Veterans ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Side ', ' interest ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' drug development ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Resequencing ', ' DNA Resequencing ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' virtual ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' All of Us Research Program ', ' All of Us Program ', ' All of Us Research Project ', ' AoURP ', ' genetic architecture ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,455280,CA-18
"Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer Abstract A few germline pathogenic structural variants (SV) have been identified in cancer predisposition syndromes, e.g., MSH2 inversion in Lynch syndrome. The advent of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the detection of SVs. However, a pitfall of this sequencing methodology is the inability to capture all SVs, given the reads do not map well to low complexity regions, and current algorithms used to identify SVs from short-read data have very low sensitivity and very high false-positive rates. One of the objectives of this fellowship is to optimize and implement an SV calling pipeline that utilizes multiple algorithms to increase the sensitivity and specificity of variant identification from germline short-read WGS trios. This pipeline is currently being developed and tested on pediatric cancer patients enrolled in the NIH-funded Baylor Advancing Sequencing into Childhood Cancer Care (BASIC3) exome study, which consists of ethnically and racially diverse pediatric patients with solid (CNS and non-CNS) tumors. This BASIC3 subset includes 63 proband/parent trios who have subsequently undergone germline short-read WGS. Five SV callers are run and then filtered using either a percent reciprocal overlap filter or a proposed Artificial Intelligence-based proximity graph filter to identify de novo and inherited SVs. This cohort has recently been selected for a long-read sequencing pilot, data which serves as the gold standard for SV detection. Comparison of short-read WGS generated SV calls with the long- read data will help determine the sensitivity and specificity of variant calls and further improve the short read pipeline (Aim 1A). Once optimized this short-read WGS SV pipeline will be applied to the Kids First Genetics of Embryonal and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma cohort (n=900), as an independent assessment of the method and also to identify recurrent germline SVs in this cancer which has not yet been well characterized (Aim 1B). The second training and scientific objective is to explore the functional effect of a novel de novo SV identified through the initial analysis. A de novo germline duplication of the Prostaglandin Reductase 2 (PTGR2) enhancer and promoter region was found in a pediatric Posterior Fossa subtype A (PF–A) ependymoma patient. Transcriptome data from the patient’s tumor revealed increased PTGR2 expression. The PTGR2 protein converts 15-keto- prostaglandin E2 to 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGE2. Studies in adult malignancies suggest that increased 15-keto- 13,14-dihydro-PGE2 is associated with cancer risk potentially through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Increased STAT3 signaling is reported as a distinct feature of PF-A ependymoma. The identified partial duplication of PTGR2 will be engineered into ependymoma progenitor cells, to functionally assess the effects on STAT3 signaling, cell proliferation, and DNA synthesis. In parallel, further analysis of PTGR2 expression and structural variants will be analyzed in pediatric ependymoma cohorts (Aim 2). Completion of this experimental plan and described training activities under Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic will provide Owen Hirschi highly interdisciplinary training in analysis of genomic data, structural variation, and the downstream effects on pediatric cancer biology. Project Narrative Structural variation occurring in the germline of pediatric patients is linked to cancer-predisposition, however the tools used to identify these events from short-read whole genome sequencing are often erroneous and limited. This project will seek to optimize a pipeline that can more accurately identify these events and determine the functional effects of one of these identified events. Such studies are essential to accurately determine how often these events occur and whether they play a broader role in pediatric cancers, as well, if these events can influence clinical care and potential cancer prevention.",Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer,10314873,F31CA265163,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', '

"Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing Abstract  Modern genetics has identified many genetic variants that affect traits such as height, but most phenotypic variation still cannot be explained by these variants alone. Importantly, differences in environment often result in individual variation of traits—including disease risk and drug response—for different genotypes. These relationships are known as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions. For example, the sickle cell allele of hemoglobin S causes sickle cell anemia, but also provides a fitness advantage in the presence of malaria by conferring resistance to infection. However, there are few examples where the exact causal variants are known. Therefore, we need to develop new methodology for identifying more of these GxE interactions, to improve prediction of disease risk and treatment outcomes.  In this study, I will fill in the gap of knowledge in GxE interactions by establishing an experimental framework for identifying hundreds of causal GxE variants in parallel, providing the first comprehensive view of GxE causal variant landscape. Specifically, I will study how thousands of genetic variants between a laboratory yeast strain (BY) and a vineyard strain (RM) lead to their differences in growth upon stress and drug treatments, as one form of GxE interaction. In Aim 1, I will use a novel gene-editing technology that can detect the fitness effects of thousands of variants in one experiment, as shown in a pilot experiment. Using this method, I will be able to map hundreds of casual variants that contribute to growth differences under various conditions, such as carbon source, oxidative stress and drug treatment. In Aim 2, I will measure allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) from BYxRM F1 hybrids in above-mentioned conditions and associate the mapped causal GxE variants, to identify GxE variants that influence growth rate through gene expression. Then, I will apply a machine learning model to predict causal GxE genes using the molecular features found in this study. By mapping causal GxE variants, linking them to gene expression and predicting causal genes through gene expression, I will establish a complete framework for accelerating the discovery of GxE interactions. Public Health Relevance The recent explosion of precision medicine based on genotype and mutations has enabled personalized treatment of diseases. However, how environmental factors influence the outcome of such treatments is not clear. By establishing a framework to study general principles and underlying molecular mechanisms of these gene-by-environment interactions, we will be able to integrate such knowledge in disease risk prediction and personalized treatment.",Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing,10216263,F31ES030282,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle disease ', ' sicklemia ', ' Carbon ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Explosion ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Sickle Hemoglobin ', ' Hemoglobin S ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrid Cells ', ' Somatic Cell Hybrids ', ' Hybrids ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', "" Baker's Yeast "", "" Brewer's Yeast "", ' S cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Lactase ', ' Lactase Enzyme ', ' Lactose Galactohydrolase ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle RBC ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' infection resistance ', ' Resistance to infection ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Polygenic Characters ', ' Polygenic Inheritances ', ' Polygenic Traits ', ' Meiotic Recombination ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Resolution ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Heritability ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Genetic study ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' precise genome editing ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,30036,CA-18
