"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology. The complexity of representing chemical graphs and the lack of thorough curation leads to frequent small molecule structure errors, which propagate across digital research assets, impeding their interoperability and reusability.

"Clinical prediction and epigenetic regulation of asthma and rhinitis Asthma and rhinitis share a strong genetic component and are the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide affecting 339 million and 500 million people, respectively. Both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis are well-studied risk factors for the development of asthma, independent of atopy and IgE sensitization, and up to 80% of asthmatics have concomitant rhinitis. Conversely, asthma is also a risk factor for the development of rhinitis suggesting a common pathophysiological link between the upper and lower airways. Individuals with comorbid asthma and rhinitis are more likely to experience frequent and severe asthma exacerbations. Currently, an unmet need exists in the understanding of the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis, including which patients are at risk and why patients with comorbid disease have increased disease severity. microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important predictive biomarkers and regulators of the pathogenesis of asthma and rhinitis. However, the role of miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) regulatory networks in asthma with comorbid rhinitis is not known. The overall hypothesis of this K23 award proposal is that the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis can be predicted by clinical factors and is regulated by miRNA-mRNA networks. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the early childhood clinical prediction of the development of comorbid disease in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology (BAMSE) cohorts and create a validated clinical prognostic tool to identify high-risk children who may benefit from early monitoring and interventions. Specific Aim 2 will identify the unique miRNA-mRNA pathways and regulatory networks in the peripheral blood that regulate asthma with comorbid rhinitis in children from the VDAART, BAMSE, and Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) cohorts to identify candidate miRNAs and biological pathways that may serve as future targets of miRNA-based therapies and biomarkers. Specific Aim 3 will prospectively validate the miRNA-mRNA signature of asthma with comorbid rhinitis across the peripheral whole blood and local nasal epithelium in subjects recruited from Brigham and Women’s Hospital to identify the shared and tissue-specific pathogenic pathways in the peripheral blood and local primary airway tissue. Through this K23 award proposal, the candidate will complete an integrated plan of mentorship, coursework, conferences, patient-oriented research, statistical and computational analyses, manuscript submissions, and R01 grant preparation. She will develop new knowledge and skills in clinical, translational, and computational research and generate new hypotheses and data that will provide the basis for future independent lines of investigation. With the support of her division, mentors, and scientific advisory committee and the resources available at her institution, the candidate is ideally positioned to achieve her goal of becoming a successful independent investigator in the epidemiology and epigenetics of asthma and allergic diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma and rhinitis frequently coexist and are the most common respiratory diseases globally, yet it remains unknown why these two diseases often develop concomitantly and why patients with comorbid disease have worse control of asthma symptoms and more frequent and severe asthma exacerbations. This proposal aims improve our understanding of the clinical risk factors and biological regulation of comorbid disease in order to facilitate the identification of high-risk patients, prognostic biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets.",Clinical prediction and epigenetic regulation of asthma and rhinitis,10127279,K23HL151819,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Child ', ' 0-11

"Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room Visits (SPACER) PROJECT ABSTRACT Asthma impacts more than 25 million adults and children in the U.S. with high associated morbidity and socioeconomic disparities in outcomes. Because effective medications are available to treat and prevent exacerbations of asthma and evidence-based interventions exist to mitigate the impact of harmful socioeconomic factors, early identification of those at highest risk is crucial. However, efforts to predict future exacerbations of asthma have yielded modest results with infrequent inclusion of comprehensive information on social hardships, such as food insecurity and housing instability, or financial hardships, such as difficulty affording the costs of controller medications which is particularly relevant for those with private health insurance. Identifying social and financial hardships requires broad-based screenings which are resource intensive, difficult to implement in clinical settings and often incomplete or limited to care seeking populations. Further, few asthma risk prediction modalities incorporate time-variable (temporal) data on important social, clinical, and environmental factors. Machine learning, an advanced computational approach to risk prediction, has great potential to improve upon conventional approaches to risk prediction of asthma exacerbations through indirect estimation of social hardships and inclusion of temporal risk factors. Implementation of enhanced asthma risk-prediction models in a health plan setting offers distinct advantages due to existing investments in asthma care management and access to timely claims data across the full care continuum. Accordingly, the aims of the SPACER study (Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room visits) are 1) To describe social and financial hardships in privately insured adults and children with asthma, and association with medication adherence and exacerbations, 2) To indirectly estimate self-reported social and financial hardships using routinely collected health plan and spatial data, and 3) To develop and validate a machine learning network model, incorporating temporal sociomarker, clinical, and environmental data, to predict asthma exacerbations in a health plan setting. The research leverages the unique research environment of the Department of Population Medicine, an academic research department of Harvard Medical School, situated in a regional non-profit health plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The mentored career development award will support Dr. Alon Peltz, a physician and health services researcher, in developing expertise in machine learning modeling and use of social data to improve prediction of adverse clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new methods for asthma risk prediction in a health plan setting by incorporating social and financial hardship data, temporal features, and machine learning. Applications of this research will directly enable U.S. health plans to better identify adults and children for enrollment in asthma care management programs in order to moderate their combined clinical and social risks for poor asthma quality.

"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),10128453,P42ES017198,"['Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hurricane ', ' indexing ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Pesticides ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Universities ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' phthalates ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Water Purification ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' water treatment ', ' contaminant transport ', ' drinking water ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Structure ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' superfund chemical ', ' superfund site ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' remediation ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' volatile organic chemical ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Superfund ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' contaminated water ', ' Water contamination ', ' contaminated drinking water ', ' drinking water contamination ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' Infrastructure ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' community involvement ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Data Management System ', ' extreme weather ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2021,2152873,MA-07
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,10144417,R01DK101674,"['Acids ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Anaerobic Bacteria ', ' anaerobe ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Genes ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Individuality ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Poison ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' toxic compound ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Tyrosine ', ' Uremia ', ' uremia of renal origin ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Diet Modification ', ' Dietary Modifications ', ' diet alteration ', ' dietary alteration ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Cresol ', ' tricresol ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Anabolism ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Sulfate ', ' Ablation ', ' human data ', ' mutant ', ' solute ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' microbiome ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' Individual Differences ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' reconstitution ', ' reconstitute ', ' gut microbiota ', ' GI microbiota ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' gut commensal ', ' gut community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microflora ', ' intestinal flora ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' comparative genomics ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' translation to humans ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' colon microbiota ', ' colon microbes ', ' colon microbial community ', ' colonic microbiota ', ' microbiota metabolites ', ' microbiota derived metabolites ', ' Infrastructure ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644301,CA-18
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and

"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",10063870,R21EB027396,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Candida albicans ', ' C albicans ', ' C. albicans ', ' C.albicans ', ' Oral candidiasis ', ' Oral Moniliasis ', ' Thrush ', ' mouth candida ', ' mycotic stomatitis ', ' oral candida ', ' Carbon ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' fungus ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' instrumentation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Collaborations ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' microbial interaction ', ' microorganism interaction ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' human-associated microbiome ', ' oral pathogen ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' combinatorial ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' screening ', ' Combinatorics ', ' phenotypic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' dysbiosis ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiotic ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' pathogenic fungus ', ' fungal pathogen ', ' fungi pathogen ', ' transposon sequencing ', ' Tn-seq ', ' Tnseq ', ' transposon insertion sequencing ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,178370,IL-13
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",10191006,U24HL138998,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old

"Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation Project Summary/Abstract Cancer metabolism is a complex network of perturbations to essential chemical and enzymatic reactions; however, the past century has seen a largely reductionist approach to understanding this system. While previously this approach was necessary due to technological limitations, current computer age technological advances allow us to survey, model, and explore the biological details of individual cells and populations of cells. Scientific fields, such as RNA biology and metabolism, have experienced massive strides in recent decades with the advent of RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, yet our ability to contextualize and extract the full extent of these enormous datasets continues to lag and often results in focusing on only a handful of entities from a dataset. This effectively causes “big data” to become “little data”. This is problematic as these experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to produce, yet we only use a fraction of the total data produced by a given experiment. For the F99 phase of my proposal, I will address these limitations by leading the development of Metaboverse, a multi-omic computational analysis framework built upon our previous work to contextualize -omics datasets within customizable and global metabolic network representations. This framework will lay the foundation allowing for the exploration of complex forms of metabolic regulation in cancer. For example, we will analyze the ability of metabolic networks to undergo dispersed and low-magnitude regulation, where, rather than one or two components acting as the core regulatory actors, regulation is performed by dispersed groups of genes, proteins, or metabolites. This framework and related regulatory research will revolutionize our ability to more holistically understand temporal metabolic shifts and gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity, as well as ensure we obtain the maximum amount of information from our data. For the K00 phase of my proposal, I will work with a postdoctoral mentor at an NCI-Designated Cancer Center or affiliated institution that will supplement my training in machine learning and network biology to develop models that improve our ability to predict metabolic state from transcriptomic state. Doing so will allow us to harness the vast transcriptomics databases in cancer biology to better understand the role of metabolism across heterogeneous tumor cell populations. My ultimate goal is to become a tenured professor and run an independent, NIH-funded research lab that focuses on computational cancer metabolism research and that develops methods for interrogating this emerging domain of biology. Project Narrative While cancer metabolism is a robust and well-developed research field, approaches to its holistic understanding are still under-developed and hinder our ability to contextualize these complex metabolic states and their consequences. During the F99 phase, I will develop tools and methods that allow researchers to explore data in a more holistic manner than previously possible, which will be essential to elucidating more complicated regulatory mechanisms within cancer metabolism. During the K00 phase, I will develop novel machine learning algorithms that will improve our ability to predict the metabolic state from the transcriptional state, allowing us to harness the rich transcription datasets found in cancer biology for therapeutic benefit.",Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation,10221654,F99CA253744,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computers ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' chemical reaction ', ' experience ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Data ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Post-Transcriptional Control ', ' post-transcriptional gene regulation ', ' posttranscriptional control ', ' posttranscriptional regulation ', ' Post-Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Predictive Cancer Model ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' neglect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' transcriptomics ', ' tumor ', ' tumor metabolism ', ' cancer cell metabolism ', ' cancer metabolism ', ' tumor cell metabolism ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning network ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' ribosome profiling ', ' Ribo-seq ', ' ribosome footprint profiling ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F99,2021,35758,UT-02
"Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic dysregulation due to in utero and early-life environmental exposures has lasting consequences on the developing immune system and lung and that these changes underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the dysregulated metabolic-immune pathways and mechanisms involved in early childhood atopy and wheeze. Our preliminary study of the infant untargeted metabolome demonstrated that dysregulation in the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and lipid mediator's pathway are associated with number of wheeze episodes in a dose-response manner, which suggests the involvement of endogenous antioxidant and lipid mediator pathways. In another preliminary study of the infant immunome, we demonstrated that two distinct infant immune response profiles to acute respiratory infection, with an immune response pattern characterized by increased Type-2 and Type-17 and decreased non-interferon Type- 1 immune responses to with increased risk of recurrent wheeze. While these single omics studies can identify dysregulated metabolites and immune-responses in wheeze phenotypes, they alone fail to capture the full spectrum of underlying pathobiology. The integration of omics data has advanced the understanding of other chronic disease pathogenesis, as it is likely to do for childhood atopy and wheeze. Therefore, we hypothesize that the integration of early-life metabolome (including lipidome) and immunome can elucidate molecular pathways relevant to atopy and wheeze development. To test this hypothesis, the candidate will capitalize on existing carefully phenotyped population-based birth cohort of healthy infants (INSPIRE) and a replication cohort from the NIH ECHO initiative (ECHO-CREW asthma consortium) and accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To investigate whether increased unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels reduce early life atopy and wheeze incidence by enhancing the bioavailability of pro-resolving lipid mediators and antioxidants and decreasing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, 2) To discover novel immunome profiles and network modules that characterize atopy and wheeze phenotypes, and 3) To uncover novel metabolic-immune molecular pathways associated with the development of atopy and wheeze phenotypes by integrating metabolome and immunome data. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) provide novel insights into the role of the early- life metabolome and immunome in the pathogenesis of atopy and wheeze and (2) identify targets for disease prevention. The proposal builds on the candidate's previous work, expertise, and interest in systems approaches to understand disease development. The goal of this career development proposal is for the candidate to emerge as an independent investigator in the field of asthma and allergy with unique knowledge and application of systems approaches to understand disease mechanisms. The candidate is in an outstanding academic environment, has a well thought out training and research plan, which will propel him into an independent expert in the field of immuno-metabolism of atopy and asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life metabolic dysregulation has lasting consequences on the developing infant immune system and lung, and these changes likely underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze (an early manifestation of allergy and asthma). Knowledge gaps remain in understanding the pathobiological mechanisms of atopy and wheeze phenotypes, which the proposed study aims to address by computationally integrating metabolome and immune response data to identify molecular pathways relevant to the pathobiology of atopic and wheeze phenotypes.

"Democratizing Multi-Omics to Expedite Discovery of Hidden Metabolic Pathways PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how metabolism changes in many diseases because we lack methods for high-throughput, unbiased discovery of indirect metabolite-protein connections. Continued ex- istence of this knowledge gap represents a major issue for public health and the mission of the NIH because, until it is filled, development of treatments for many diseases will remain largely intractable. Multi-omic analysis of proteomes and metabolomes from the same system offers a promising path to discover hidden metabolic pathways, but the requirement for human expert interpretation is a critical barrier that prevents complete value extraction from multi-omic experiments. The long-term goal of the Meyer Research Group at Medical College of Wisconsin is to reveal previously hidden metabolic pathways. The overall objective here, which is the first step in realizing this vision, is to democratize multi-omic data collection and data interpretation, thereby increasing the pace of metabolic pathway discovery. The central hypothesis is that artificial intelligence models can learn to draw new metabolic connections between metabolites and proteins. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data generated by the applicant and published literature, which shows how the strategy reveals known and new connections between metabolites and proteins. The rationale for the proposed research is that unbiased, data- driven discovery of new metabolic connections with AI algorithms (such as deep neural networks) will result in new and innovative therapeutic targets that can be manipulated positively or negatively to prevent or treat dis- ease. Guided by preliminary data and literature, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two complementary focus areas: (1) multi-omic data integration, and (2) multi-omic data collection. The multi-omic data integration focus uses AI models, already established as feasible in the applicant’s lab, to predict metabolite-protein inter- actions. AI models will be optimized with existing public data, models will be validated with newly collected data, and then novel metabolic connections will be validated using classic genetic and biochemical techniques. The second focus area builds new, fast methods for multi-omic data collection to feed data into AI models, starting from a recent advancement published by the applicant (Meyer et al., ChemRxiv 2020, accepted at Nature Meth- ods). The applicant’s lab will further develop this method to quantify the full yeast proteome, and also extend the method to enable multi-omic analysis on a single platform. This approach is innovative because it departs from the status quo of slow multi-omic data interpretation requiring expert humans by building and validating a new, automated AI method for metabolite pathway discovery. The multi-omic data collection focus is innovative be- cause it departs from the status quo of slow multi-omic data collection requiring multiple platforms and hours per sample by enabling unified multi-omic analysis in minutes. This contribution will be significant because ulti- mately, the knowledge, validated methods, and resource datasets generated by this project will open new hori- zons in drug development for diseases with altered metabolism, such as cancers and diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of new metabolic connections between proteins and metabolites is ultimately expected to increase our range of treatable disease, which will lead to new therapeutics and increase healthy lifespan. The democratization of methods enabled by the proposed research will greatly increase the pace of metabolic pathway discovery.

"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN.

"Towards In Vivo Imaging of Tissue Metabolomics PROJECT ABSTRACT: The ability to measure and quantify the composition and abundance of various metabolites in biological samples, also referred to as metabolomics, provides a unique window into the complex biological processes at different scales. So far, the field of metabolomics has mainly been driven by technologies based on mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These technologies, although powerful, only measure metabolite profiles in homogenized biological extracts, e.g., biofluids or dissected tissues, thus losing the spatial information of the underlying metabolic processes. As spatial heterogeneity is a hallmark of metabolism, especially in complex biological systems such as animals and humans, obtaining spatially resolved metabolomics has been a dream of many biomedical scientists and engineers. In recent years, MS imaging (MSI) has emerged as a tool of choice for imaging metabolomics, which allows for the generation of spatially localized metabolite profiles from tissue sections. One major limitation of MSI is that it requires post-mortem or invasive tissue sampling, thus unable to probe metabolism at the most physiologically relevant states. This has limited its translation to human studies. MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is another alternative for imaging metabolomics. It combines the powers of MRI and NMR spectroscopy to produce spatially resolved tissue metabolite profiles, noninvasively. However, MRSI is highly limited in its poor spatial resolutions. Furthermore, most MRSI studies only target a single nucleus (e.g., 1H), thus limited in the number of molecular species measured. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a research program that will pave a path towards in vivo imaging of tissue metabolomics. Specifically, we aim to develop an unprecedented high-resolution multinuclear MRSI technology that can simultaneously map a large number of metabolites in vivo, synergizing advancements in ultrahigh- field MRI instrumentation, fast data acquisition, and machine learning driven computational imaging techniques. We also propose a novel multimodal MRSI and MSI imaging framework for validating our multinuclear MRSI technology and integrating two complementary biochemical imaging modalities for tissue metabolic profiling. Novel computational approaches will be developed to analyze the high- dimensional metabolomic data. Success of the proposed research will establish a new paradigm for generating and analyzing imaging metabolomics data. This paradigm will transform metabolomics into a powerful noninvasive and tissue specific technology (from an invasive and nonspatial-specific one) for studying metabolism in living animals and humans. These advances will enable new means to unravel the metabolic basis of normal physiological functions and different diseases, inspiring developments of new biomarkers, novel treatments, disease prognosis and management strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The field of metabolomics has mainly been driven by technologies that either completely lose the spatial information of the underlying metabolic processes being studied or require invasive procedures, thus unable to probe metabolism at the most physiologically relevant states.

"The role of gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites in the development of type 2 diabetes in humans PROJECT SUMMARY Mounting evidence links the gut microbiome – the modifiable “second genome” consisting of trillions of diverse microbes that inhabit the human gut – with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans. Studies using fecal transplant in mice have raised the central hypothesis that changes of the gut microbiome and the biochemical by-products originated from these microbes may be key modulators of development of T2DM. To date, however, knowledge of the specific microbial species that drive the development of T2DM in humans remain very limited. Human studies of the gut microbiome in T2DM have largely been cross-sectional and confounded by reverse causality. Indeed, many of the gut microbiome changes observed in human T2DM have been found to be a consequence of the disease or treatments, including the medication metformin, rather than a cause of T2DM. In addition, the circulating metabolites derived from the gut microbes that contribute to the development of T2DM remain to be discovered. In this Early Stage Investigator NIH R01 application, we propose the largest prospective study of the role of gut microbiome in T2DM using a Finnish cohort of 6921 individuals with fecal and plasma samples collected in 2002 and over 15 years of subsequent clinical follow up. This proposed study brings together a diverse team with deep expertise in the human microbiome, mass-spectrometry based metabolomics, computational biology, statistical epidemiology, and diabetes pathobiology, to specifically address the key biological and clinical questions regarding the role of gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites in the development of incident T2DM in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE The gut microbiome are key modulators of human health and disease.

"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways.

"Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is becoming increasingly evident that the composition and metabolites produced by the human gut microbiome influence the progression of cardiovascular diseases. While we are continuing to discover important associations between the gut microbiome and human physiology and diseases, we lack the tools and methodology to precisely manipulate gut microbiota to benefit human health. We propose to develop computational models and optimization frameworks to predict community dynamics and functions and design interventions to shift the gut microbiome to desired states. We will design novel bacterial therapeutics that operate autonomously in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to steer the microbiome towards healthy states. These next-generation bacterial therapeutics will sense important gut microbiome metabolites, process information, and deliver species- specific antimicrobial proteins to reshape the dynamics and functions of this ecosystem. The performance of these bacterial therapeutics will be characterized in vitro using synthetic human gut microbiome communities and in gnotobiotic mouse models of cardiovascular disease.

"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,10246291,K08HL148178,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', '

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample. This work proposes several novel computational techniques that address limitations of current metabolomics analysis tools.

"Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive. ADRS driven by immune-mediated hypersensitivity (including rashes, hepatotoxicity, and Steven-Johnson syndrome) are the most difficult to predict and occasionally can be severe as well as fatal. Hypersensitivity-driven ADRs are the leading cause of drug withdrawal and termination of clinical development. Yet a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid these ADRs entirely if reliable models of bioactivation existed. Accurate prediction and identification of molecules prone to ADRs would revolutionize drug development by screening out ADR-prone candidates early, before exposure to patients, and guiding drug modifications to reduce ADR risk. Small molecules are not intrinsically immunogenic and instead, involve bioactivation into reactive metabolite is that then covalently modify proteins to create immunogenic antigens. “Structural alerts” are molecular substructures prone to bioactivation, and they are often used to identify small molecules prone to bioactivation, and at risk of bioactivation-mediated ADRs. Currently, bioactivation relevant alerts are defined by experts, and they have important limitations that this study overcomes. It is now possible to predict metabolism and reactivity and toxicity using machine learning approaches. Building on this foundation, this proposal systematically discovers new structural alerts by explicitly modeling the impact of metabolism on reactivity and hence the potential to form ADR-relevant adducts. We hypothesize that (1) known bioactivation reactions, (2) molecule citation data, and (3) new substructure mining algorithms can be used to identify emerging structural alerts. Aim 1. We will test this hypothesis by using a computational approach to systematically mine structural alerts from databases of known metabolism and reactivity reactions. Aim 2. We will computationally and experimentally validate structural alerts and assess their structural contingencies. Structural alerts are only conditionally bioactivated, depending on the precise molecule they appear. Newly proposed structural alerts, moreover, are most useful when there is experimental evidence that they in fact can be bioactivated.  PubHlthRel: Structural alerts discovered in this study will help scientists avoid toxic molecules in drug development, and better understand why medicines on the market become toxic. Overcoming a fundamental limitation with structural alerts, machine learning models of bioactivation will clarify in which molecules alerts are and are not bioactivated. This knowledge will help scientists make safer medicines in the future, modify existing medicines to make them safer, and reduce ADRs by using existing medicines more safely. Modified Public Health Relevance Section  Some medicines cause dangerous and expensive Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), and many of these ADRs are caused by bioactivation. Structural alerts are substructures prone to bioactivation, and scientists use them to identify molecules prone to bioactivation mediated ADRs. Using a combined data-mining and experimental approach, this proposal systematically discovers emerging structural alerts of increased importance in recently studied molecules. Knowledge gained from these studies could foster improved dosing regimens for marketed drugs and enable scientists to design safer medicines.",Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts,10260584,R01GM140635,"['Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolic Activation ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mining ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ', ' Erythema Multiforme Major ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' Acute Liver Failure ', ' Acute Hepatic Failure ', ' Fulminant Liver Failure ', ' Fulminating Hepatic Failure ', ' Fulminating Liver Failure ', ' fulminant hepatic failure ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Metabolic ', ' gene function ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' adduct ', ' drug modification ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' drug market ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' immunogenic ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' small molecule ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' immunogenicity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' liver injury ', ' Injury to Liver ', ' hepatic damage ', ' hepatic injury ', ' liver damage ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical development ', ' deep learning ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,375910,MO-01
"Systems Metabolomics for Biomarker Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolomics offers a comprehensive analysis of thousands of small molecules in biological samples. It can play an indispensable role in the growing systems biology approaches to unravel the relationships between metabolites and diseases. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been used for high-throughput analysis of thousands of metabolites. However, the potential values of many disease-associated metabolites discovered by using these platforms have been inadequately explored in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery due to lack of computational tools and resources to: (1) accurately determine the identity of most of the metabolites; (2) investigate the rewiring interactions among the metabolites due to diseases; and (3) integrate metabolite profiles with those from other omics studies to evaluate the relationships between the metabolites and the diseases at the systems level. Partly due to these limitations, poor generalizability of previously identified metabolite biomarker candidates has been observed, especially when they are evaluated through independent platforms and validation sets. Therefore, new methods are sought to find more generalizable metabolite biomarker candidates. The goal of this research program is to fill the gaps in metabolite identification and multi- omics integration by using systems metabolomics approaches that will enhance the role of metabolomics in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery. Specifically, the proposed research program will utilize multiple resources (biological databases, spectral libraries, etc.) and innovative statistical, machine learning, and network-based methods for: (1) developing a comprehensive workflow for ranking putative metabolite IDs; (2) differential analysis of metabolite profiles based on changes in the levels of individual metabolites and pairwise interactions in disease vs. control groups; and (3) integration of metabolomics data with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and glycoproteomics data to identify highly promising metabolite biomarker candidates. Our recent progress has led to acquisition of multi-omics data and development of computational tools for metabolite identification and integrative analysis. The performance of the proposed metabolite identification workflow in ranking putative metabolite IDs will be evaluated through experimental methods using reference compounds. The differential and integrative analysis methods will be used for selection of candidate biomarkers via multi-omics data acquired in biomarker discovery studies. The selected candidates will be evaluated by targeted quantitation using independent samples and platforms compared to those used for discovery. The outcomes of these experimental evaluations will be used not only to help refine the computational methods but also to identify promising biomarker candidates. In summary, the proposed research program seeks to capitalize on the power of network modeling, machine learning, and multi-omics data integration to improve the ability to find disease biomarkers that are likely to succeed in future large-scale biomarker validation studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this research program is to develop computational methods that enhance the role of metabolomics in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery. Specifically, statistical, network-based, and machine learning methods will be developed for ranking putative metabolite IDs and selection of metabolite biomarker candidates.

"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,10206210,R01HD092297,"['Affect ', ' Animal Welfare ', ' Animals ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Breast ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breast fed ', ' Breastfed ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Cattle ', ' Bovine Species ', ' bovid ', ' bovine ', ' cow ', ' Culture Media ', ' growth media ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' Industry ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lactation ', ' lactating ', ' lactational ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mastitis ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Milk ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' nutrition ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' macromolecule ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Exclusive Breastfeeding ', ' Exclusive Breast Feeding ', ' exclusively breast fed ', ' exclusively breast feeding ', ' exclusively breastfed ', ' exclusively breastfeeding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Metabolic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' offspring ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Mammary gland ', ' Gland ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' microbiome ', ' protein metabolite ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' high risk ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' inflammatory milieu ', ' inflammatory environment ', ' milk production ', ' produce milk ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' milk microbiome ', ' dysbiosis ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiotic ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' bacterial community ', ' mammary ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2021,443259,ID-01
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods.

"Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10405294,F32DC019030,"['Chemistry ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' GC MS ', ' GCMS ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Odors ', ' Olfactory Pathways ', ' Olfactory system ', ' olfactory circuitry ', ' olfactory circuits ', ' Perception ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Sensory ', ' experience ', ' Recipe ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Palate ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' food science ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' model building ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2021,2500,PA-03
"Profiling the human gut microbiome for potential analgesic bacterial therapies The human gut microbiome is an essential component of host physiology: it modulates immune activity, influences the balance of neurotransmitters both peripherally and centrally, and produces a vast and variable array of small-molecule metabolites which enter circulation to impact distal body sites. It is highly heritable, implying a symbiosis that has developed over evolutionary timescales, but is also susceptible to the influence of diet and other factors such as antibiotic use. Notably, disruptions in microbiome composition are associated with a number of disorders characterized by chronic pain and inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. Given the microbiome’s immunomodulatory and metabolic capacities, and its role as a pseudo- endogenous component of human biology, human gut-derived bacteria are a promising potential source of novel, safe, and non-addictive therapeutics for pain management. However, the mechanisms underlying the “gut–pain axis” are still being elucidated, and key functional drivers of the observed connections have yet to be identified. As such, to advance the development of microbiome-derived biotherapeutics for pain management, the goals of this project are: to identify human-gut-native bacteria capable of engaging established pain targets in vitro, to validate their activity and analgesic/anti-inflammatory potential in vivo, and to develop a computational tool to predict microbial-genetic drivers of response, which can guide future mechanism validation and therapeutic development. Because the vast majority of human gut bacteria are strictly anaerobic, they cannot be cultivated using typical laboratory equipment and techniques. This has historically presented a roadblock in mechanistic explorations of the gut microbiome’s therapeutic potential, resulting in a focus on “culture-independent” methods such as metagenomics—approaches that produce a wealth of correlative data, but little by way of causal validation. Holobiome is uniquely suited to meet this complex challenge, having overcome the difficulties inherent in anaerobic cultivation to build an in-house strain library of nearly ten thousand bacterial isolates from a variety of donors which contains representatives of nearly every major human gut-bacterial taxon cultured to date. This resource, along with an assembled team bringing extensive experience in microbiology, mammalian cell culture and assay development, and computational genomics, will allow a diverse library of human gut bacteria to be individually screened for their capacity to modulate cytokine response, cyclooxygenase expression, TRP channel activity, and other targets with high therapeutic potential for pain. This approach is expected to provide concrete insights on the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences nociception and the inflammatory response, with implications for the development of novel non-opioid analgesics. Findings of this research may also have translational potential for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease, which has both autoimmune components and demonstrated links to the microbiome. While a rapidly growing body of research ties perturbations in the human gut microbiome to countless aspects of health and disease, most of this work is correlative in nature and provides relatively little information regarding the direction of causality and the mechanisms involved. This project, which aims to identify human gut-native bacteria capable of modulating nociception and inflammation, will generate valuable insight on the roles of specific gut taxa and bacterial genes in regulating pain sensitivity. The outcome of this project will represent a major step toward the development of novel non-opioid analgesics with a strong safety profile, which may also help stem the ongoing opioid

"Cyanobacterial pseudo-natural products for anticancer drug discovery PROJECT ABSTRACT Cyanobacteria produce secondary metabolites have been well-documented to possess potent and selective anticancer activity, which has resulted in FDA approval of a cyanobacterial antibody-drug-conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of several Hodgkin lymphomas. Even though this highlights the critical role of natural products in the drug discovery, the novelty of structural scaffolds has largely remained steady in the last two decades. Therefore, we aim to design and synthesize a pseudo-natural product library inspired by cyanobacterial metabolites with well-described anti-cancer activity to expand their molecular coverage. Our pseudo-natural product library will develop and describe uncharted chemical space that integrates privileged scaffolds while employing medicinal chemistry approaches, such as combinatorial chemistry and parallel synthesis. We will qualitatively and quantitatively characterize our library using modern computational, machine learning and metabolomic techniques, to compare it with natural products and FDA-approved drugs. The long-term goal of this research is to generate a chemical library rich in natural product scaffolds that are biased towards cancer tissue for drug discovery and development. Our main hypothesis is that our library will contain chemical architectures embedded with biological properties of privileged cyanobacterial structures that describe new chemical space.

"Proteomic Stable Isotope Probing as a Novel Approach for Linking Prebiotics with Active Gut Microbiota PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Characterization of the metabolic interactions between organisms is key to understanding the mechanisms of disease and symbioses between microbes and their animal hosts. Our long-term goal is to advance the applicability and accessibility of proteomic stable isotope probing (SIP) in ways that make it a valuable tool for microbiome researchers looking to measure in situ metabolic interactions of human microbiota. The objective of this proposal is to improve the performance and reproducibility of experimental measurements and accelerate the computational analysis of proteomic SIP experiments and to demonstrate the value of this method for studying the in vivo and in vitro metabolism of prebiotics by gut microbiota. Expected outcomes will represent a significant advance, because optimizing the use of prebiotics as therapeutics requires identification of the specific microorganisms capable of metabolizing prebiotics. By identifying proteins of specific taxa that are synthesized as a direct result of prebiotic assimilation, proteomic SIP will provide unambiguous links between prebiotic metabolism and the specific microorganisms responsible for this activity. We will accomplish this objective by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to increase the performance and reproducibility of mass spectrometry measurements by optimizing data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods for proteomic SIP; 2) to significantly accelerate the computing-intensive database search step by adapting the Sipros algorithm to use graphic processing units (GPUs) and cloud computing; and 3) to track in vivo and in vitro prebiotic assimilation patterns by microbial populations within simple consortia and complex natural communities. Our proposed work includes several innovations, such as the application of deep learning algorithms to improve the analysis mass spectrometry data, leveraging GPU-based parallel computing and cloud computing to accelerate the computational steps in the data analysis workflow, and using proteomic SIP for the first time to track prebiotic metabolism by gut microbes. The expected outcomes of the project include (a) a new DIA- based workflow for proteomic SIP that can identify significantly more labeled peptides at higher accuracy of enrichment estimation, (b) a new computational workflow that is faster to run, more scalable to large datasets, and more accessible to researchers, and (c) establish novel foundational knowledge on the specificity of prebiotic metabolism by microbes in the gut. These outcomes will establish proteomic SIP as a valuable -omics tool that will complement existing approaches to study the metabolism of gut microbiota, and specifically highlight its ability to investigate metabolism of prebiotics and probiotics as they relate to treating microbial dysbiosis and nutrition-related diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prebiotics is a potential treatment for dysbiosis in human gut microbiota, which plays a role in many diseases, including diabetes and obesity.

"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular

"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. Suitable tools, however, do not yet exist for engineering the microbial communities that constitute the human microbiome.

"Machine Learning for Drug Response Prediction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Finding new drugs in the seas of small molecules is a difficult task if no prior information is available. Our broad research goal is to develop innovative and accurate machine learning algorithms to predict the drug responses related to complex human diseases.

One research goal is to understand and predict the cell line-specific responses through integrating a wide range of methods, including the propagation of drug effects via biological networks, matrix factorization of molecular profiles and chemoinformatic analysis of small molecules. We will deploy our algorithms to softwares and web servers, which will inform the downstream experimental design to identify the single and combinatorial drug candidates against human diseases.

"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal

"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,10176558,R01HL142503,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Computers ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Patient Care Planning ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Weather ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Case Manager ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Patient risk ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' care costs ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,775715,WA-07

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,10085244,R01GM120033,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Sodium Chloride ', ' salt ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' experimental analysis ', ' stem ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' biological systems ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical implementation ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' automated analysis ', ' computational suite ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,356625,TX-09
"Circulating Plasma Metabolites, Lifestyle Factors, and Mortality Risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-throughput metabolomic studies have shown promise in elucidating potential pathways underpinning aging processes and longevity. However, data in human populations are still constrained by small sample sizes and a limited number of metabolites profiled. Existing studies have also not integrated data on diet and lifestyle to evaluate the associations of interest in a comprehensive manner. A better understanding of aging- related metabolic alterations and whether metabolite profiles are modulated by lifestyle factors is crucial to develop effective strategies to promote health and well-being. The main goal is to identify novel metabolite profiles associated with mortality and prolonged longevity, and investigate whether the metabolomic signatures of lifestyle factors are associated with mortality and longevity. We propose to leverage unique resources from two large U.S. cohorts with long follow-up and extended lifespan data: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) (n~8,100). The results will be replicated in two independent populations: the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) (n~2,300), and the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) Study (n~3,000), a population at high cardiovascular risk in Spain. This research application is aimed at: (1) identifying plasma metabolomic profiles and networks associated with mortality and longevity; and, (2) identifying the metabolomic signatures of a healthy lifestyle score and examining its prospective association with mortality and longevity. The proposed project is built on the numerous strengths of existing cohort studies in U.S. and Mediterranean populations, and supporting results from the preliminary work conducted by our multi- disciplinary team. Findings from this study will provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of longevity and advance our understanding of how plasma metabolomics may mediate the associations between lifestyle factors and mortality risk. The proposed research will generate new knowledge that can directly inform specific lifestyle interventions applicable in clinical settings to improve the health and well-being of adults as they age. The proposed research will provide a wealth of preliminary data to stimulate further research on longevity and healthy aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to leverage unique resources with longitudinal data to identify metabolite profiles and networks associated with total mortality and longevity, and investigate whether the metabolomic signatures of a healthy lifestyle score are associated with the risk of mortality and longevity, in U.S. and Mediterranean populations. This study has the potential to identify novel metabolic signatures of both mortality and longevity and improve our understanding of how lifestyle factors modulate metabolites and mortality risk, which can help to design better preventive and intervention strategies.","Circulating Plasma Metabolites, Lifestyle Factors, and Mortality Risk",10298057,R21AG070375,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lipids ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' mortality ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Spain ', ' Supervision ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Sample Size ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Adherence ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' lifestyle data ', ' life-style data ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' secondary analysis ', ' never smoking ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2021,239250,MA-07
"The unleashed microbiome of cancer patients as a discovery platform for rational microbiome engineering Project Summary The human gut microbiome is associated with a range of diseases, and may positively or negatively affect the success of therapies. However, the causal directions between the human gut microbiome and host health are seldomly clear due to a lack of feasible controlled experiments in humans. High resolution, high frequency temporal data of paired microbiome and physiological measurement, and rich metadata of potential confounders, allow the application of causal inference frameworks. Such data can be mined for potential microbiome drivers of host health, especially if both the microbiome and host physiology are perturbed during the time courses. We have recently published a vast longitudinal microbiome set from cancer patients undergoing severe perturbation of their immune system. Concurrently, these patients experience dramatic shifts in their gut ecosystem. We here propose to unlock this data and build a discovery platform for microbiome causality, towards rational microbiome engineering. We will develop a new machine-learning technique that enables rapid exploration of our data through effective visualization and a web-based interface. We will develop a new method to identify gut microbial competitor species of common pathogens, which are systematically missed by existing approaches but are representing the most promising targets for microbiome engineering. Finally, we will elucidate the bidirectional interplay between human- targeted medications and the gut microbiome. For this, we will leverage our large data set of paired microbiome and host immune cell trajectories. This will validate recent in vitro results indicating that human-targeted medications may influence gut ecology using in situ data, and it will identify potential gut microbiome modulation of pharmacokinetics. Project Narrative This project seeks to provide a platform for the discovery of causal health effects of the human gut microbiome. For this, it provides exploration tools and inference techniques that unlock the potential of a recently acquired, vast data set comprising >10,000 stool samples, >1.5 million medical records, and >400,000 blood measurements from cancer patients. This enables discovery of candidate microbes that affect pharmacokinetics of human-targeted drugs, and reveals natural competitor species to common pathogens, thus revealing targets for rational microbiome engineering, towards turning the human gut microbiome into a therapeutic target of the future.",The unleashed microbiome of cancer patients as a discovery platform for rational microbiome

"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,10250319,R01CA218664,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', '

"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes.

"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health. The research described here will enable a deeper understanding of disease-related microbial systems and help to formulate strategies to combat diseases.",Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space,10256801,R35GM138241,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Chemistry ', ' Inorganic Chemistry ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrochemistry ', ' Electrodes ', ' Environment ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Dioxygen ', ' Microbial Biofilms ', ' biofilm ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' base ', ' Surface ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Reaction ', ' microorganism ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' biocompatibility ', ' biomaterial compatibility ', ' microorganism culture ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' microbial ', ' simulation ', ' transition metal ', ' Transition Elements ', ' Devices ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Length ', ' nano array ', ' nano array Analytical Device ', ' nanoarray ', ' Nanoarray Analytical Device ', ' nano ', ' nanomaterials ', ' nano materials ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' combat ', ' gut microbiota ', ' GI microbiota ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' gut commensal ', ' gut community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microflora ', ' intestinal flora ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2021,371084,CA-33
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome

"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s health.",Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence,10282850,K01AI163413,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Archives ', ' Award ', '

"Using Genetic and Blood Metabolites to Understand the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease in Latinos U.S. Latinos are highly diverse, with individuals originating from central and south America, as well as the Caribbean. Latinos are socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to U.S. Whites, and suffer from a higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. Genetic determinants of Alzheimer’s disease may be somewhat different in Latinos compared to Whites: in preliminary results, we found that genetic background, in the form of proportion of genome inherited from Amerindian (Native American) ancestors mitigates the detrimental effect of the APOE-𝜖𝜖4 variants on cognitive decline in individuals from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). This suggests heterogeneity in genetically-based mechanisms underlying neurocognitive decline in Latinos. Untargeted metabolomics is a promising approach to develop potential biomarkers for human disease. Previous metabolomics studies identified potential biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease and for cognitive traits in a cross- sectional manner, however, very little work was done specifically in Latinos, and the genetics and metabolomics have not been integrated for risk prediction, apart from using APOE-𝜖𝜖4. Here, we propose to utilize a dataset including ~1,500 older Latino adults from the HCHS/SOL with untargeted metabolomics measured at a baseline visit, and neurocognitive function estimated in both the baseline and a follow-up visit. Our goals are: (1) develop preliminary biomarkers for aging-related cognitive decline phenotypes (e.g. change in global cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment); (2) study the genetic basis of the association of metabolites with cognitive decline, and study potential heterogeneity by genetic background; and (3) form recommendations and a grant application to support a larger research program utilizing genetics and metabolomics, and potentially other ‘omics, to develop biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease in diverse populations, and study underlying mechanisms. We will leverage an existing data set of diverse, well phenotyped, Latinos from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, to study the association of circulating blood metabolites with cognitive decline. We will develop and study prediction models based of blood metabolites, and assess the role of genetics and genetic ancestry on both blood metabolites and their association with cognitive decline. Our results will form a basis for a larger study of genetic and omics mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s disease in diverse US Latinos.",Using Genetic and Blood Metabolites to Understand the Risk of

"Discovering Chemical Activity Networks-Predicting Bioactivity Based on Structure PROJECT SUMMARY NIEHS has established Predictive Toxicology as a strategic goal for advancing environmental health sciences. The overarching goal of this RIVER proposal is to predict animal toxicity of chemicals based on their structure. My team and I will expose millions of zebrafish embryos to a library of 10,000 synthetic chemicals across wide concentration ranges. If a chemical shows signs of bioactivity, we will systematically analyze whole animal gene expression changes before the phenotype appears. We will formulate hypotheses about which biomolecular targets the chemicals attacked initially and which pathways led to the observed endpoint. To test those hypotheses, we will edit the zebrafish genome via CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out or over-express critical genes, to discover the ones causally related to the chemical phenotypes. These studies will be highly relevant to human health. Zebrafish possess fully integrated vertebrate organ systems that perform the same functions as their human counterparts and demonstrate well-conserved physiology. Eighty-four percent of the genes that participate in human disease also exist in zebrafish. Zebrafish studies provide a fast, inexpensive way to screen a large volume of chemicals, generate rich hypotheses for drug development, and prioritize candidates for toxicity studies with mammals and human cell cultures. We will compare our results with those of human cell culture studies to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each method and to reduce the uncertainty associated with applying zebrafish results to human biology. We will post our experimental results in a public database that explains which of the 10,000 Tox21 chemicals are bioactive, which initial targets they strike, and which pathways lead to which endpoints in embryonic and juvenile zebrafish. This information will enable green chemists to detoxify products by substituting a biologically inactive molecule. It will help toxicologists and risk assessors to prioritize chemicals for expensive experiments with rodents and human cell cultures. It will give pharmaceutical scientists thousands of new data points upon which to develop hypotheses about how to modulate a given gene target or activate a given pathway. We will use machine-learning-based chemoinformatic approaches to analyze our zebrafish data and infer the relationship between the structure of a chemical and its biological activity. Our rich data about chemical activity networks will advance the scientific community’s understanding of linkages between chemical exposure and phenotypes. Our work will enable scientists to predict whether a chemical will be biologically active, what target it will act upon, and what networks it will perturb, solely on the basis of its structure. It will enable scientists to reduce, refine, and replace experiments with animals, including zebrafish, and to predict chemical activity networks with computers.

"Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American ABSTRACT  Obesity is a major public health problem that is related to a variety of illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for obesity, possibly through alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully clear how these alterations contribute to obesity. In this study, we examine how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination are related to eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis. Our prior research has suggested that BGM alterations play an important role in the development of obesity. Our study focuses on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that they encounter a high burden of obesity as well as exposure to social stressors.  We will screen and enroll approximately 300 Mexican and Filipina women who will then provide information about social stressors via a survey, dietician-administered 24-hour food recall, measured anthropometrics (e.g. waist circumference), questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and accelerometer data on physical activity. Stool and serum to determine microbial-related measures (16sRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics), and MRI to assess brain alterations in the extended reward network will be collected. Advanced multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from multiple data sources (neuroimaging, microbiome and metabolite profiles, survey data, diet, and clinical/behavioral data). This analysis will determine the unique variance associated with ethnicity and social stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and the BGM axis related to obesity. An integrated systems investigative approach such as the one proposed is a critical step to understanding the mechanisms contributing to obesity. Further the impact of how environmental stressors “get under the skin” and impact eating behaviors and diet patterns and the BGM axis is important in addressing health disparities in ethnic groups and in women. This premise guides the specific aims of this proposal: Aim A: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on brain signatures and eating patterns in obesity. Aim B: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity. Aim C: We will apply advanced analytical techniques in order to determine ethnic differences in the influence of stressors on the BGM axis in obesity.  The results of this study will provide novel information about a possible pathway whereby social stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk. It will also provide new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long term, this research may suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce inequalities in obesity and related health problems. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study will provide new information about how social stressors contribute to obesity among Mexican and Filipino American women. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that stressors lead to eating behaviors and dietary changes and that alter the brain-gut-microbiome axis. A better understanding of the role of how stress “gets under the skin” to contribute to alterations in the brain and gut microbial metabolites in obesity, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies tailored to treat altered ingestive behaviors and obesity.",Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican

"IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  Asthma is a common disease, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Though well controlled in most, some experience disease that is refractory to standard treatments such as corticosteroids. Recent efforts focused on understanding these severe asthma (SA) patients suggests ontological heterogeneity. Previous work from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort linked epithelial gene signature to clinical phenotype. We revisited this data set and identified 3 novel groups of asthmatics, one of which housing the majority of SA cases and having the worst lung function and greatest exacerbation history. Using principal drivers of variance in the data set, we found that expression of the interleukin 18 receptor (IL18R1) along with 18 other genes was able identify at-risk asthmatics. IL18R1 has been previously linked to asthma in genome-wide association studies. Its ligand, interleukin-18 (IL-18), may be a cofactor for both Th1 and Th2 inflammation. High IL-18 levels have been detected in serum and sputum of asthmatics including in those with fatal asthma. Importantly, IL-18 and IL18R1 regulate epithelial barrier function in other inflammatory conditions. We have confirmed an increase in IL18R1 at the protein level in SA patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using lung biopsies from very severe asthma cases. These SA patients also harbor increased numbers IL-18+ cells, the cognate ligand for IL18R1. Downstream targets of IL18 stimulation, including the active phosphorylated forms of JNK1 and c-Jun, show increase in SA airway epithelium. SA patients also show disorganization of adherens junctions, suggesting breakdown in epithelial barrier integrity.  Based on this background and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IL-18 pathway activation, via elevated IL18R1 expression in bronchial epithelium, promotes dysregulated barrier function that contributes to SA pathobiology by increasing immune cell access to foreign antigens. We propose 2 aims to address this: Aim 1. We will interrogate pre-existing tissue banks for quantitative analysis of IL18R1 and compare that with levels of its ligand in tissue and fluids from these patients. These data will be corroborated with activity of associated signaling pathways and tight/adherens junction integrity. Aim 2. We will us primary human airway epithelial cells, obtained bronchoscopically from HCs and asthmatic patients to mechanistically confirm and expand upon the results from Aim 1. This will include validation of ex vivo results as well as quantification of barrier function.  These data will identify a novel role for IL18 in severe asthma pathogenesis and open up new avenues for treatment of this difficult and costly disease. The activities of the project will provide the PI with valuable experience in obtaining, culturing and manipulating primary human airway epithelial cells and lay the foundation for future in vivo work by integrating study in computational biology and immunology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Severe asthma is disease with tremendous impact on patient quality of life and significant cost of treatment. We have used machine learning to identify the IL-18 pathway as a potential driver of this disease which may one day be targeted for novel treatments. Thus, we propose confirmation of these findings using an extensive ex vivo tissue collection as well as mechanistic validation using primary human airway epithelial cells to lay groundwork for future in vivo study.",IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma,10116175,F32HL147415,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Affect ', ' Air ',

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10159296,R01GM131491,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gases ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Smoking ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Stress ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Metabolite Interaction ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical effect ', ' interoperability ', ' user-friendly ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' lipidomics ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,376064,WA-07
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we aim to bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This approach will bring statistical rigor to the ﬁeld of force ﬁeld construction and application by providing a means to make data-driven decisions, while enhancing reproducibility by enabling it to become a rigorous and reproducible science using a fully open infrastructure and datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life do their jobs. They also use simulations to help design new medications – compounds that can bind and inﬂuence the behavior of these molecules of life, and thereby block diseases at the molecular level. We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,10105344,R01GM132386,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Charge ', ' chemical synthesis ', ' Chemistry ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Perception ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Generations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Error Sources ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Electrostatics ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' physical property ', ' physical model ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Readability ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' drug discovery ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' biophysical mechanism ', ' Biophysical Process ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' quantum ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' simulation software ', ' biophysical model ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' unnatural amino acids ', ' non-natural amino acids ', ' non-proteinogenic amino acids ', ' nonproteinogenic amino acids ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' nucleic acid-based therapeutics ', ' therapeutic nucleic acids ', ' data infrastructure ', ' software infrastructure ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,608856,CO-02
"Enabling the Accelerated Discovery of Novel Chemical Probes by Integration of Crystallographic, Computational, and Synthetic Chemistry Approaches ABSTRACT Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii) Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.  More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra- large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization. Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.  Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical probes against diverse target proteins. We expect that our AI-based computational approach to convert crystallographically-determined chemical fragments into lead compounds coupled with the experimental validation of computational algorithms will accelerate the discovery of new chemical probes, expand the druggable proteome, and support future drug discovery studies PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is devoted to the development of a novel integrative, structure-based, artificial intelligence driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated for three selected targets, transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and bromodomain BAZ2B, and then optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development.

"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Current generation molecular simulation models are insufﬁciently accurate, and current generation tools for building those models are limited, not automated, and based on aging infrastructure. Our original R01, “Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Fields for Predictive Biophysics and Drug Design,” aims to solve these problems, producing a modern infrastructure for building, applying, and improving accurate molecular mechanics force ﬁelds. As part of our NIH-funded project, we have collaborated closely with the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) to use the QCArchive ecosystem to gen- erate and continuously expand very large quantum chemical datasets relevant to biomolecular systems on a variety of supercomputing resources. QCArchive now contains over 42M quantum chemical calculations for over 39M molecules, and has become incredibly popular, with over 1.79M accesses/month. Large quantum chemical datasets relevant to biomolecular systems are incredibly valuable to the AI/ML community. Data is the key element needed for both fundamental research into ML architectures and constructing predictive models for downstream use. Unfortunately, quantum chemical datasets are incredibly expensive to generate, limiting in-house generation of large, useful datasets needed to drive AI/ML research to a few large companies and researchers with access to sufﬁcient computing resources. While AI/ML quantum chemical methods have shown immense promise for biomolecular systems, the limited access to large, curated datasets has greatly hindered researchers from making rapid progress in this area. We aim to bridge this gap by working closely with MolSSI QCArchive developers to address robustness, scal- ability, and data delivery challenges to meet the needs of the biomolecular AI/ML community requiring access to large quantum chemistry datasets (Aim 1). Additional software developers will enable improvements to the QCArchive infrastructure to meet the rapidly growing demands of the AI/ML community. As QCArchive is primarily maintained by a single MolSSI Software Scientist, additional developers are necessary for fully enabling the AI/ML community to take full advantage of the wealth of data generated by our NIH-funded project directly, as well as the data actively being generated by the tools our project has engineered to enable distributed, fault-tolerant quantum chemistry that is rapidly populating QCArchive. We will additionally develop interfaces and dashboards to enable facile discovery, retrieval, and import of quantum chemical datasets within popular machine learning frameworks (Aim 2). To ensure our tools are speciﬁcally useful for the most promising AI/ML applications, we will collaborate directly with AI researchers in the OpenMM, TorchMD, and SchNetPack communities actively developing and deploying quantum machine learning (QML) potentials for biomolecular simulation, with the goal of producing generally useful tools suitable for the wider community yet capable of driving these high-priority applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life carry out their functions and to design new medications. This project is designed to improve the models used to perform these simulations, and as a byproduct of this process uses a large amount of supercomputer time to generate valuable quantum chemical data relevant to biomolecular systems. This supplement will make it possible for us to freely and easily share this data with machine learning researchers, enabling anyone to easily access and use this data for building better models of biomolecular systems.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,10412594,R01GM132386,"['Aging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Industrialization ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Ingestion ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' chemical reaction ', ' computational quantum chemistry ', ' quantum chemistry ', ' success ', ' supercomputer ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Supercomputing ', ' super computing ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' rapid growth ', ' cluster computing ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' quantum ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' fundamental research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' community led research ', ' community participatory research ', ' community research ', ' participatory action research ', ' data sharing ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' dashboard ', ' TensorFlow ', ' Infrastructure ', ' software infrastructure ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,177686,CO-02
"POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS: ULTRASENSITIVE DETECTION, EARLY LIFE EXPOSURES-CLINICAL OUTCOMES (PRETERM BIRTHS, CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE, AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS), PREVENTION AND REMEDIATION Project Summary The overarching goal of this project is the development of new and innovative approaches to ultrasensitive detection and identification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and their functionalized derivatives (polycyclic aromatic compounds, or PACs). Ms. Mary Bajomo, will pursue research central to these project goals, as outlined by both Specific Aims. The Specific Aims of this Diversity Supplement form a central, essential subset of the work required to achieve the project goals, and provide an essential foundation for the sensing methods to be developed over the course of this project. They also lay the groundwork for bringing Machine Learning methods into the subfield of spectroscopic chemical sensing. Pursuing research at the interface between Chemistry and Machine Learning presents an exceptional training opportunity for Ms. Bajomo, and will allow her to interact strongly with the three PIs and their research groups in three fields: the Halas group, for experimental chemistry in the area of surface-enhanced spectroscopic sensing, the Nordlander group, on nanoparticle-based substrate design, and the Patel group, experts in Machine Learning and Data Science. Our hypothesis is that Machine Learning classifiers can be developed and used to distinguish between specific PAH and PAC molecules found in environmental or biological samples through their vibrational spectroscopic signatures. An essential aspect of this approach is the identification of PAH and PAC molecules while embedded in a molecular or polymer capture layer that has been designed to extract PAH/PAC molecules from environmental and/or biological samples that has its own specific spectroscopic signature “background”. These investigations are foundational to the detection of multicomponent mixtures of PAH/PAC molecules from realistic environmental or biological samples, using a combination of surface- enhanced spectroscopies and Machine Learning algorithms analogous to image recognition in cluttered, complex background environments. The two Specific Aims that Ms Bajomo will pursue are: Specific Aim 1: The identification and quantitative characterization of a universal capture layer for the wide range of PAH and PAC compounds encountered in biological and environmental samples. This capture layer would be serve as a universal coating for surface-enhanced Raman and Infrared spectroscopic substrates, and allow for the extraction of PAH and PAC molecules from solution in concentrations suitable for detection, consistent with concentrations of these chemicals found in samples of interest. Specific Aim 2: To develop surface-enhanced chemical sensing data as input to Machine Learning classifiers, to benchmark their effectiveness in identifying specific PAH molecules and distinguishing PAH/PAC molecules from each other by ML methods. This close synergy between experimental spectroscopic studies and ML classifier testing presents an outstanding opportunity for graduate training at the interface between two extremely important and dynamic research field for Ms. Bajomo.

"Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10224338,K01HL153941,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Joints ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Program Development ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration Disorders ', ' Respiratory Disorder ', ' breathing disorder ', ' respiratory dysfunction ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Sphingolipids ', ' statistics ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Tryptophan ', ' L-Tryptophan ', ' Levotryptophan ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Woman ', ' Mediating ', ' psychogenetics ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Communication Research ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biological systems ', ' screening ', ' asthmatic ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' Formulation ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic profile ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' antenatal ', ' antepartum ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,178200,MA-07
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in

"Biology-aware machine learning methods for characterizing microbiome genotype and phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY 1 The Mirarab laboratory designs leading computational methods for answering biological and biomedical ques- 2 tions, focusing on scalability and accuracy. These methods span several areas (e.g., microbiome proﬁling, 3 multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenomics), and a common thread among them is evolutionary mod- 4 eling. The lab has developed scalable and accurate methods for reconstructing evolutionary histories (i.e.,  5 phylogenies) and using these histories in downstream biomedical applications. Reconstructing phylogenies is a  6 fundamental goal and a precursor to many biological analyses. Methods developed by this lab (e.g., ASTRAL) 7 are at the forefronts of modern genome-wide phylogenetics. Moreover, biomedical research increasingly uses 8 evolutionary histories in diverse areas like microbiome analyses, immunology, epidemiology, and comparative 9 genomics. While the lab has previously focused more on inferring species histories, it has recently started 10 to shift its focus to developing methods for microbiome analyses. The inference and the use of evolutionary 11 histories in analyzing environmental microbiome samples present a unique set of challenges. 12 In the next ﬁve years, the Mirarab lab will focus on designing, testing, and applying improved methods for 13 statistical analyses of microbiome data. These methods will target two questions. (i) Proﬁling: What organisms 14 constitute a given sample? (ii) Association: How are samples different in their organismal composition, and 15 how do these differences connect to measurable characteristics of their environment? While both questions 16 have been subject to considerable research, many computational challenges remain, providing an opportunity 17 for better methods to make a signiﬁcant impact. Instead of focusing solely on new algorithms, the lab will 18 also work on building better reference datasets and combining data from multiple sources. Thus, the project 19 aims to harness the unprecedented computational power, large available datasets, and recent advances in 20 machine learning to improve state-of-the-art dramatically. The project will not use off-the-shelf machine learning 21 methods in a black-box fashion. Instead, it develops methods that incorporate biological knowledge (e.g., of the 22 evolutionary relationships) into machine learning methods in a principled biologically-motivated fashion. 23 The lab will pursue several ambitious goals for both proﬁling and association questions. The project will 24 (i) create methods to infer a continuously-updated reference alignment and tree encompassing all sequenced 25 prokaryotic genomes (half a million currently) to be used for proﬁling, (ii) build methods for ultra-sensitive sam- 26 ple proﬁling, (iii) use deep learning to connect data obtained using amplicon sequencing and metagenomics, 27 (iv) build discordance-aware phylogenetic measures of sample differentiation, and (v) develop machine learning 28 methods for associating a proﬁled microbiome to phenotypes of interest such as disease. These new methods 29 will draw on statistics, machine learning, discrete optimization, and high-performance computing. Consistent 30 with the goals of MIRA, the project may explore new unforeseen opportunities if they ﬁt its general goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite intensive efforts to develop methods for analyzing fast-growing environmentally-sequenced microbiome data, many challenges remain, and there is substantial room for improvements. We will build several methods for building better reference datasets, increasing the accuracy of proﬁling contents of microbiome samples, and ﬁnding associations between changes in the proﬁle and phenotypes of interest. Our publicly available methods will use advanced algorithms, statistics, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, but will adopt these techniques to incorporate a deep understanding of the evolutionary processes that shape the microbiome.",Biology-aware machine learning methods for characterizing microbiome genotype and phenotype,10275055,R35GM142725,"['Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunology ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' comparative ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' microbiome analysis ', ' analyze microbiome ', ' deep learning ', ' multiple data sources ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2021,344669,CA-52
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and

"Computational prediction of gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism Project Summary / Abstract Notwithstanding pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials performed to identify efficacy, side effects, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), only 25-60% of patients respond favorably to prescribed drugs, leading to a cost of $30-$130 billion in the US annually. ADRs are partially attributed to the gut microbiome, i.e. the complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome interacts with different types of xenobiotics including drugs, resulting in biotransformation of therapeutics into metabolites with altered disposition, efficacy, and toxicity. Gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism leads to non-effective treatments as well as teratogenic, toxic, and lethal effects that in some cases were not recognized until the drug was on the market. As a result, leading pharmaceutical researchers have begun to recognize that the role of gut microbiome in drug metabolism should be accounted for in attempts to improve treatment effectiveness. However, despite extensive progress in gut microbiome research, there is currently no reliable, cost-effective approach to integrate gut-mediated drug metabolism in drug development pipelines. This Phase I proposal aims to address this challenge by developing a new computational platform with the ability to predict microbial metabolism of therapeutic drugs and to leverage that information to enhance drug design and development. We will employ a range of state-of-the-art computational biology techniques to reliably screen for microorganisms that may metabolize the target drugs. The novelty of this project lies in the ability to screen drug-metabolizing enzymes/microorganisms using multiple metrics and methods to increase the reliability of predictions to achieve the accuracy necessary for clinical and commercial use. This multi- method platform will be built, integrated, and validated in an iterative fashion using targeted in vitro experiments on two candidate drugs, i.e. the anti-arrhythmic drug amiodarone and the anti-viral drug famciclovir. This project is designed to both advance our current understanding of microbiome function in the context of drug-gut interactions as well as inform strategies to help enhance public health and economic growth. The value proposition of this project includes leveraging publicly available bioinformatics databases as well as advances in computational biology techniques to develop a more precise, reliable, and inexpensive tool for gut microbiome-mediated metabolism of therapeutic drugs. This in-silico platform could be employed for both current drugs as well as drugs under development. For current drugs, this platform can help increase the safety of drugs by predicting the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity as they may differ from individual-to- individual. For new drugs, the platform would reduce the cost and timeframe of drug development, while increasing the effectiveness of the therapeutics themselves. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) place significant clinical and economic burden on patients, their care-givers, and healthcare systems.

"Characterizing individual- and subtype-specific risk factors and treatments in asthma Project Summary/Abstract Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease affecting about 340 million people worldwide, yet its causal biology, environmental risks, key cell types, and optimal treatments remain under-characterized. This difficulty is partly due to clinical heterogeneity, as different risk factors drive asthma for different people. Asthma subtype studies have already begun to reveal important aspects of this heterogeneity. However, asthma subtypes remain nascent and ambiguous and have not yet realized their potential utility for scientific studies and precision treatments. In particular, genetics has not been fully exploited for asthma subtyping, though it has a unique ability to assess the causal biological significance of subtypes and can identify key cell types; conversely, prior subtyping studies are susceptible to coincidental subtypes that are not directly relevant to asthma biology. Furthermore, prior studies have used basic methods which are liable to bias and low power. To address these limitations, we will develop a powerful and robust framework to pinpoint and genetically characterize asthma subtypes, and we will broadly apply it in large, deeply phenotyped, and diverse cohorts. Our study will identify novel subtypes and their demographic, genomic, cellular, and clinical etiologies, which can suggest precision treatments and improve power and interpretation in basic and translational research. Our work will improve genetic prediction of asthma, particularly in understudied populations. Finally, our approach and freely released methods will provide a broad template for complex trait subtyping. To accomplish these goals, we will study four large biobanks, which offer unprecedented sample size, clinical depth, and demographic diversity. We will use functional genomics to link genetic heterogeneity to causal and cell type-specific molecular mechanisms. We will build on our prior machine learning tools to identify subtypes, quantify their genetic and clinical significance, and infer their dominant cell types. Our methods are unique by correcting for confounding population structure, which is crucial for genetic subtyping: spurious genetic associations led prior studies to propose severely biased and regressive nosology. A key goal of this proposal is the PI’s retraining in asthma biology, pulmonology, and functional genomics. This will be achieved by close mentorship from Professors Carole Ober, Julian Solway, Yoav Gilad, and Matthew Stephens, as well as didactic courses in the UChicago Department of Medicine and Institute for Translational Medicine. This retraining will maximize the biomedical impact of our study by enabling the PI to deeply connect quantitative results to core facets of asthma pathology and will establish the PI as an independent asthma researcher who can optimally apply his statistics and machine learning background to tackle essential biomedical hurdles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is a chronic and increasingly common disease, yet its causal etiology, environmental risks, key cell types, and optimal treatments remain largely unclear, which is partly due to asthma’s extreme heterogeneity. We will develop a powerful and robust machine learning model to identify and characterize genetic asthma subtypes, especially their specific cellular etiologies, in large, diverse, deeply phenotyped biobanks; these subtypes will improve power and interpretation in scientific studies and advance precision medicine. The PI’s retraining in respiratory biology and close mentorship from world experts will maximize the biomedical impact of our inferred genetic subtypes and establish the PI’s independent asthma research program.",Characterizing individual- and subtype-specific risk factors and treatments in asthma,10191398,K25HL157603,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' respiratory ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' translational medicine ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K25,2021,140562,IL-01
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.

"Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation ABSTRACT During the first 3 years of life (YOL) the infant gut microbiome (GM) rapidly diversifies both in structure and function, concomitant with dietary and environmental transitions. Critically, the GM response to specific external stimuli is patient-specific, complicating individualized risk predictions. Healthy GM maturation includes accruing multiple strains of the same species, which frequently differ in key functions. These functional differences, ac- centuated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and de novo mutations, could resolve conflicting associations of the same species with both health and disease. The rationale behind our proposal is that strain- and species- level variation in bacterial functions drives heterogenous GM responses to early-life (EL) dietary and antibiotic perturbations, which explains, in part, individualized developmental trajectories. This proposal pursues two highly complementary Aims: 1) Define strain-resolved functional maturation of the pediatric gut microbiome and 2) Investigate the acute effects of EL antibiotic (ELA) perturbation on strain dynamics, HGT, and micro- biome maturation in preterm neonates and microbiota-humanized mice. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that EL environmental exposures shape genomic diversification of gut species, causing lasting changes in GM com- munity structure and microbial functions. We will leverage our unique set of 2,436 stools collected over the first 9 YOL from infants variably exposed to dietary and environmental stimuli. By combining culture-enriched meta- genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, we will determine taxa-function relationships at the sub-spe- cies level and power statistical models that predict the impact of EL exposures on strain diversification, microbe- function associations, and transcriptional activity. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ELAs acutely alter strain dynamics and stimulate HGT and that the GM response to ELA can be predicted from baseline composition and function. Here, we will interrogate 160 stools flanking variable ELA exposure in 80 preterm neonates in the first 4 months of life, combining culture-enriched metagenomics with selective culture and isolate sequencing to char- acterize the preterm `plasmidome' and profile post-ELA strain dynamics and HGT. To identify microbiome-intrin- sic responses to ELA, we will utilize an innovative transgenerational mouse model where germ-free dams receive human, preterm, microbiota that is vertically transferred to their pups, which are treated with parenteral antibiot- ics. We will use the resulting data to predict individual GM responses to specific antibiotics based on composition, resistance gene content, and bacterial functions. Our proposal is innovative because our interdisciplinary re- search team will characterize strain-level bacterial functions to understand the heterogeneity of GM responses to EL perturbations on two pre-existing sets of human specimens; it is significant because it will identify features that predict species-resolved GM-specific responses to EL selection. Our work will advance pediatric microbi- ome research by comprehensively characterizing strain-resolved functional maturation and GM disruption to understand individual variation leading towards a future of personalized, microbiome medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study addresses our gap in understanding how the early life human gut microbiome responds to diet and antibiotics, including impacts on functional maturation and horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance. This research is relevant for public health because it will improve our understanding of the effects of antibiotics and diet on microbiome dynamics beyond the coarse level of microbial communities and establish predictive models for future personalized antibiotic treatment and dietary recommendations that minimize collateral damage and maximize development of the healthy infant microbiome. By complementing data from two unique human cohorts with hypothesis testing in a mouse model this project is relevant to the NIH's mission of leveraging basic research in mechanisms of health and disease to improve outcomes in treatment and maintenance of human health.",Impact of early-life perturbations on pediatric microbiome maturation,10298201,R01AI155893,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass

"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,10224318,R34HL145442,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Feedback ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Self Management ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Sample Size ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Health Information System ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' peak flow measurement ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user centered design ', ' iterative design ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' asthmatic ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2021,256469,FL-14
"Clinical, imaging, and endoscopic outcomes of children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic goals in pediatric Crohn’s Disease (CD) have shifted from clinical improvement or remission to endoscopic healing (EH) by ileocolonoscopy and transmural healing (TH) by magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). This shift happened because patients who achieve complete healing (CH, TH and EH) experience lower rates of subsequent hospitalization, therapy escalation, or surgery than those with EH alone or no healing. We hypothesize that specific pre-treatment clinical, radiologic, genomic, and microbial factors along with attainment of targeted anti-TNF biologic exposure will be associated with the primary endpoint, CH, and the major secondary endpoints, EH and TH, 52 weeks after anti-TNF start.. We will test this hypothesis in a prospective cohort study of 570 newly diagnosed pediatric-onset CD subjects who initiate treatment with anti-TNF medication within 6 months of diagnosis. We will administer personalized anti-TNF biologic therapy guided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) using a novel dosing algorithm which we developed. Aim 1. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between CH and baseline measures of clinical and radiologic severity. We hypothesize that pre-treatment nutritional status, antimicrobial serologies, and MRE findings will be associated with CH 52 weeks after anti-TNF start. Formal hypothesis tests will be carried out to confirm the predictive power of a set of pre-specified measures using a logistic regression model. We will also conduct exploratory analyses of novel predictors, identified via machine learning methods, to assess their relationship with CH after adjusting for the confirmed primary predictors. Aim 2. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between CH and baseline host and microbial genomic and metabolic factors. We hypothesize that pre-treatment gene expression signatures and microbial factors will be associated with year 1 CH. We will characterize the host genotype, longitudinal microbial taxonomic and metabolomic profiles, and ileal and colon host epigenome and transcriptome at baseline and at 52 weeks after anti-TNF start. Aim 3. Use a k-fold cross-validation procedure to determine the optimal predictive model of year 1 CH. We hypothesize that a model which includes host gene signatures and microbes will improve prediction of CH beyond one based on clinical and imaging factors alone. The model will include significant clinical and imaging predictors from Aim 1 and the subset of baseline host and microbial characteristics found to be potentially explanatory in Aim 2. Impact. The proposed inception cohort study, CAMEO, will be unique in providing a robust, novel platform to study factors that contribute to healing in pediatric CD that can then be immediately translated into clinical practice, as well as guiding future therapies targeting the microbiota and host immune responses in patients unlikely to achieve healing with current approaches.

"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample. This work proposes several novel computational techniques that address limitations of current metabolomics analysis tools. We anticipate that this work will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis,10242075,R01GM132391,"['Adoption ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' gastrointestinal system ', ' Ailmentary System ', ' Alimentary System ', ' Digestive System ', ' Gastrointestinal Body System ', ' Gastrointestinal Organ System ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' nutrition ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Letters ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' physical property ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' MeSH ', ' Medical Subject Headings ', ' MeSH Thesaurus ', ' PubMed ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' chemical standard ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Validation ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' PubChem ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' combinatorial ', ' open source ', ' gut microbiota ', ' GI microbiota ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' gut commensal ', ' gut community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microflora ', ' intestinal flora ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' dark matter ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' microbiota metabolites ', ' microbiota derived metabolites ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NIGMS,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2021,372055,MA-07
