"Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting tens of millions of people. A top research priority in AD is to find a biomarker sensitive to early disease and disease progression because that will likely provide the best opportunities for searching and evaluating effective treatments for this currently incurable brain disease. Human brain relies on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its energy supply and waste removal. Previous research has indicated that CBF reductions cause neuron inactivity and neurotoxic waste accumulation and subsequently neuron death, which may eventually lead to AD dementia. Measuring CBF and following its longitudinal course may then provide a highly potential biomarker for early AD and its progression. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is a technique for quantifying CBF without using exogenous tracers. Because it is relatively cheaper and can be repeated many times, it is well suited for longitudinal AD research. Sensitivity of ASL MRI to AD and prodromal AD has been shown in many cross-sectional studies (comparing AD to controls) by other groups and us. But several important questions still remain unanswered including the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD and AD progression, the longitudinal CBF change patterns, and sex difference of CBF in AD. Addressing those questions needs large size longitudinal data and expertise for analyzing ASL MRI data due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The purpose of this project is to address those open questions by leveraging our extensive expertise on ASL MRI and the accumulating longitudinal ASL data from ADNI (a large ongoing multi-site AD neuroimaging study). The novel information or outcome from this project will include the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD, CBF change rate when disease progresses or reverts, gender effects in AD and its progression, and a next-generation ASL MRI processing algorithm based on deep-machine learning (DL), and a DL-based AD prediction model. We will first confirm our previous ADNI ASL CBF findings using larger sample and updated methods (not available before). We will then check sensitivity of ASL CBF for tracking and predicting disease progression or cognitive declines. Gender effects on CBF in AD will be explicitly examined, which may reveal a clue for the higher prevalence of AD in females. We will revisit those studies using the DL-based ASL denoising algorithm. Pursuing those aims will help establishing ASL CBF as an AD biomarker and provide a versatile AD prediction model using ASL CBF as well as other valuable biomarkers provided in ADNI. Developing and sharing the DL ASL MRI denoising method will benefit not only AD research but also the various scientific projects based on ASL MRI. The feasibility of this innovative but clinically important project is ensured by our decades of experience and the substantial pilot investigations in each aspect of the study, including ASL MRI, AD ASL study, and machine learning. Identifying biomarkers sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression is central to AD studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and assessed for early AD detection and progression monitoring. We will also develop a next-generation ASL denoising technique to further improve ASL CBF SNR and reliability. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact. Developing the proposed technique will benefit not only AD study but the general neuroimaging research.",Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease

"Social spatial navigation assessment for early-stage Alzheimer's disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a public health epidemic, laying an enormous mental, physical, and financial burden on individuals, families, and societies. Despite significant research efforts around the world, the specific link between cognitive / functional deficits and the underlying pathology remains unclear. Critical to solving this is the evaluation of novel cognitive tests within cohorts that have detailed biomarkers for AD pathophysiology. Widely used cognitive tests for AD focus on episodic memory deficits, but recent work led by us and others indicates that tests of spatial navigation and orientation may provide significantly more accurate detection of the earliest signatures of AD. Our hypothesis is that integrating tests of navigation and orientation (to people, places, and events) into one test will prove particularly sensitive. Currently no such test exists.  Our aim is to develop and evaluate a novel ecologically valid cognitive test which probes both navigation and orientation in order to assess cognitively normal older adults (CN), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD dementia participants from two ongoing imaging studies (R01 AG053184 and R01 AG067021) of the Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Gad Marshall. Participants will undergo amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) as part of those studies, which we will leverage in relating those biomarker findings to our novel cognitive test across the early AD continuum. Creating the new test will require combining the expertise of Co-PI Dr. Hugo Spiers (expert in spatial navigation) and Co-PI Dr. Shahar Arzy (expert in orientation). Dr. Spiers has recently developed a virtual reality (VR)-based assessment tool for smartphone and tablet devices that has tested 4.3 million participants on their navigation ability. While this enables an unparalleled opportunity for machine learning to detect subtle impairments, the task is not tailored to the individual’s personal world, which clinical experience as well as research from the Co-PI, Dr. Arzy, indicate to be critical in AD. We therefore propose to develop a novel patient-tailored digital personalized tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of early- stage AD. Building on our recent work, Google Street View (GSV) images will be used to display and enable navigation of the participant’s familiar environment. Overlaid text messages will pop up to provide information about the overriding cover-story and to test navigation and orientation. We will benchmark how hard each person’s environment is to navigate using reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained on the local street networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to understand the brain networks engaged by the new task and allow a comparison with the pathological and clinical data collected by Dr. Marshall. Machine learning models will be used to detect subtle impairment in the individual participant level. Following Dr. Spiers’ success in mass appeal and the access to advanced machine learning analyses, the project will enable precision personalized diagnostics of people at the earliest symptomatic stages of AD, and later on, a digital tool to conveniently follow patients over time. Project Narrative  The development of a new digital diagnostic test for the assessment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is ecologically valid is of great importance. In the process, we will gain a new understanding of how people orient and navigate in familiar places and social networks and obtain a more detailed understanding of the changes in the brain that take place in AD in relation to the main problems that occur early in the disease. Finally, new insights into the brain dynamics involved in navigating space and social networks will be gained.",Social spatial navigation assessment for early-stage Alzheimer's disease,10126352,R21AG070877,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Space Perception ', ' Spatial Discrimination ', ' perceptual spatial orientation ', ' spatial orientation ', ' spatial perception ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Social Network ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Event ', ' Parietal ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Inferior ', ' Visit ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' simulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' Pittsburgh Compound-B ', ' ligand PIB ', ' Impairment ', ' user-friendly ', ' way finding ', ' spatial navigation ', ' wayfinding ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' imaging study ', ' amnestic mild cognitive impairment ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', "" Alzheimer's biomarker "", "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' β-amyloid burden ', ' Aβ burden ', ' a-beta burden ', ' abeta burden ', ' amyloid burden ', ' beta amyloid burden ', ' βamyloid burden ', "" Alzheimer's disease test "", ' Alzheimer Disease test ', ' Alzheimer test ', "" Alzheimer's test "", ' test for Alzheimer ', ' ']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,190054,MA-07
"Roles of Gray Matter Brain Aging and Small Vessel Disease in AD Pathophysiology In this Yr16 renewal of our longitudinal study on the natural progression of AD biomarkers, the central goal remains to further understand the occurrence of asymptomatic amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau deposition and the progression to clinical cognitive impairment. This cohort has now matured to the point that there is now sufficient longitudinal follow-up to address important hypotheses that were formulated from the beginning of this study but could not be properly addressed until 10-15 years of follow-up were in place - as is the case now. In this renewal period we aim to better characterize the different roles gray matter brain aging and small vessel disease have on AD progression. Chronological age is the most salient risk factor for late-onset AD. However, it remains unclear what components of the aging process account for this risk. In this proposal, we use gray matter brain age models to study the atrophy-related components of aging and 7T vascular imaging to characterize the SVD components of aging. Aim 1 uses this estimated gray matter brain age to explain individual differences in AD biomarkers and cognitive decline. Aim 2 uses fMRI and cerebrovascular imaging at 7T to examine the role of SVD in accelerating the amyloid-induced tauopathy and neurodegeneration. Aim 3 ties together brain aging and SVD to test components of a model that small vessel disease (SVD) accelerates Tau deposition and neurodegeneration (including accelerated gray matter brain aging). Over the last 2 years we have transitioned the MR imaging of this study to a 7T MR scanner to take advantage of its high field strength for 1) characterizing small vessel morphology (e.g., early markers of cerebrovascular disease) associated with AD risk and 2) characterizing functional neural systems (fMRI). Over the course of this study we have shown that many (~25%) of cognitively unimpaired older adults have significant cerebral amyloid deposition, subsequently defined as preclinical AD. We and others have shown that in this preclinical stage, cross-sectional Ab burden is only weakly associated with objective cognitive performance. At this early disease stage, Ab burden is more strongly associated with changes in the functional connectivity, which can be measured by fMRI. We and others have identified that regional medial temporal lobe functional connectivity (MTL_FC) during memory encoding is associated with increased Ab load. In recent preliminary work, we have found that traditional markers of SVD interact with amyloid burden in their relationship to MTL_FC. Those with high Ab and high White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) burden have particularly high regional MTL_FC. In individuals with Ab burden, SVD accelerates tau deposition, neurodegeneration, and progression of cognitive and clinical decline. The current cohort of 70 active participants will be supplemented by recruitment of additional older adults to achieve 200 baseline assessments. Individuals will undergo 3 MRI scans and 2 Ab- and tau-PET scans over a 32-month interval. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study was one of the first to demonstrate that cerebral amyloid deposition precedes cognitive decline by as much as 10-15 years. There appears to be great variability in the time from becoming amyloid positive until cognitive decline. Longitudinal studies, such as this one, which has been going on for 15 years, provide a unique opportunity to characterize the progression to Alzheimer’s disease.",Roles of Gray Matter Brain Aging and

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate multi-modal neuroimaging to quantify the heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans posing a significant burden to the community and health care system. Machine learning (ML) methods have been crucial in detecting the disease and characterizing its progression. Due to the lack of an in vivo “ground truth” diagnosis, ML approaches have typically relied on clinically derived labels and a case-control design in their search for a single imaging pattern that optimally distinguishes between the two groups in the case-control design. However, heterogeneity within clinical labels may degrade performance and interpretability. The goal of this project is to address this limitation and accurately characterize heterogeneity in preclinical and symptomatic AD. Given that age is a major risk factor for developing dementia, we will characterize healthy aging using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 1. To this end, we propose to develop a novel unsupervised multi-view machine learning tool that can integrate information from multiple imaging modalities (i.e., structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and amyloid and tau sensitive Positron Emission Tomography) in a principled way. This will enable us to define the normal trajectory of age- related changes across all modalities, providing the necessary context to understand AD pathology. We will characterize AD pathology using multimodal neuroimaging data and ML in Aim 2. To this end, we propose to develop a novel semi-supervised ML framework that integrates multimodal information and derives data-driven disease dimensions. This is achieved by identifying and quantifying at the individual level imaging patterns that capture neuroanatomical and neuropathological alterations. Our approach builds on our extensive prior work on using an advanced, unsupervised multivariate pattern analysis technique, termed orthonormal projective non-negative matrix factorization, for analyzing neuroimaging data. Importantly, our project leverages two large multimodal datasets, the Knight AD Research Center (ADRC) cohort and AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which sample participants across the continuum of AD making them ideal for investigating heterogeneity of AD pathology using advanced ML techniques. If successful, our approaches could be used for studying any brain disorder and could be readily integrated into personalized medicine strategies in the future when rich, multimodal imaging data collection will become a routine diagnostic procedure in hospitals. Project narrative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans posing a significant burden to the community and health care system. Measurements of anatomy derived from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as well as measurements abnormal amyloid and tau protein depositions derived from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are increasingly used in AD research. In this project, we propose to develop advanced machine learning methods that can integrate information from PET and MRI toward characterizing disease heterogeneity in preclinical and symptomatic AD. This can improve our understanding of the underlying biological causes of the disease, leading to improved diagnosis and prognosis as well as therapeutic innovation by enabling patient stratification

"Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While important progress has been achieved in our understanding of the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics, as well as genomic and neurobiological substrates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, identifying individuals at a preclinical stage remains a vital priority and substantial challenge. The early and accurate identification of at-risk individuals becomes particularly important as we embark on next- generation randomized clinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of AD. The NIA recently convened a workshop involving experts from academia, nonprofit organizations, and industry with the goal to consider cost- effective strategies to improve the early detection of cognitive decline. A key recommendation by workshop participants emphasized opportunities to leverage existing longitudinal studies and apply machine learning techniques as a cost-effective approach to detect early cognitive decline. The current proposal represents a targeted step toward achieving those recommendations by leveraging a large and ongoing longitudinal study of APOE genotype and cognition (led by Dr. Richard Caselli at Mayo Clinic Arizona), and applies machine learning to identify individuals at risk for incident MCI at the earliest possible detectable stage. Machine-learning (ML) techniques implement predictive algorithms to find optimal mathematical and computational solutions to a set of complex problems. In dementia research, ML and pattern detection algorithms have been applied mainly to neuroimaging data, or neuroimaging data combined with clinical and genetic data, to distinguish prevalent MCI or AD cases from healthy controls. However, it remains to be determined whether ML algorithms can be marshalled as a key strategic and predictive approach to identify cognitively normal individuals at the earliest detectable stage of incipient decline. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposal aims to: (1) Investigate whether subtle variations among standard clinical and cognitive measures at baseline are associated with subsequent decline and incident MCI. Methods to achieve this aim consist of an ensemble ML approach, anchored by a random forests learning algorithm, applied to baseline demographic, clinical, and cognitive data as well as APOE genotype in a cohort of 784 adults. (2) Develop a probabilistic algorithm that predicts out-of-sample incident MCI cases. This aim will be accomplished by selecting 80% of the longitudinal data as an in-sample subset and using a dynamic Bayesian network approach to model the probabilistic trajectories of diagnosis at each study visit. With this Bayesian model, it will be possible to develop an algorithm to estimate each person’s unique risk of future MCI diagnosis. (3) Validate the predictive diagnostic algorithm using the remaining 20% of longitudinal data (out-of- sample subset), plus data from additional accruals during the intervening period. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health by helping to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE As our scientific field embarks on next-generation preclinical trials to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, it become critically important to identify accurately who amongst cognitively healthy adults is at an increased risk of cognitive decline and development of dementia. Consistent with the recommendations from the NIA to find cost-effective solutions that capitalize on existing data and apply new methods from artificial intelligence, the current proposal aims to apply machine learning techniques to identify, at the earliest possible detectable stage, those individuals who are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Successful completion of this project will be relevant to public health as it may help to improve the prediction of dementia at a very early stage using standard clinical measures, and potentially aid in the implementation of therapeutic interventions.",Machine learning to predict incident MCI using standard clinical measures,10108473,R03AG070486,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', '

"National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where currently 5.8 million people are living with AD dementias, and this number is projected to almost triple to 13.8 million by 2050. In addition AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD) healthcare costs for people ≥65 years were an estimated $277 billion in 2018. Although putative risk and protective factors have been identified, published studies have been unable to identify how to prevent and mitigate disease progression and who is most vulnerable mostly because the existing studies are based on small sample size and lack statistical power to disentangle the effects of different factors. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (a ubiquitous yet modifiable exposure dangerous to the aging brain) has been associated with decreased cognitive function, faster cognitive decline, dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Toxicological and human studies provide evidence of an association between air pollution and neurodegeneration, highlighting potential biological pathways that include systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. In response to PAR-17-054, our goal is to leverage massive nationwide datasets (Medicare and Medicaid), coupled with advanced statistical methods, to overcome the limitations of existing studies and clarify risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct national epidemiological studies using Medicare and Medicaid claims for the period 2000-2021 for the continental US, to estimate the association between exposure to air pollution and the time to the first AD/ADRD hospitalization. Among enrollees that have been hospitalized for AD/ADRD or MCI we will assess whether air pollution exposure increases risk of mortality, and/or accelerates re-hospitalization for AD/ADRD. In Aim 2 we will apply machine learning methods to identify co-occurrence of individual-level (previous hospitalizations, race, age, and sex), environmental (weather, green space, and noise), and SES risk (or protective) factors to determine which population subgroups are most/least at risk for AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression following air pollution exposure. In Aim 3 we will develop methods to overcome statistical challenges including (1) disentangle the effects of air pollution exposure from other confounding factors by leveraging approaches for causal inference, and (2) correct for potential outcome misclassification. We will conduct side-by-side epidemiological analyses using traditional methods (e.g. regression) and causal inference and machine learning approaches to understand which statistical challenges require more sophisticated approaches. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we will provide peer-reviewed open-source software so other investigators may implement our methods. In summary the results of this proposal will characterize the link between air pollution exposure and AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression, will identify the multiple modifiable risk and protective factors that determine vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and provide the foundation for implementable actions to prevent and reduce this enormous health burden. This project will leverage data on two cohorts (Medicaid and Medicare enrollees) to characterize the impact of air pollution on risk for and progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), and identify the complex interactions of individual-level, environmental and societal factors that lead to increased vulnerability in AD/ADRD. We will develop innovative, transparent, and reproducible methods to address current statistical challenges including outcome misclassification. We will determine the impact of multiple inter-related environmental protective and risk factors to address the multi-factorial AD/ADRD health burden.","National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution",10134188,R01AG066793,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' NO2 ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' Noise ', ' Ozone ', ' O3 ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Weather ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Update ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' open source ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' high risk ', ' Medicare claim ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Green space ', ' greenspace ', ' fine particles ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' protective factors ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2021,732992,MA-07
"Artificial Intelligence Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease Research Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common disease that is partly due to protein misfolding and aggregation. Research on AD is a national priority with 5.5 million Americans affected at an annual cost of more than $250 billion and no available cure. This is despite heavy investments in the collection of diverse clinical and biological data in experimental and population-based studies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have the potential to reveal patterns in clinical and multi-source large-scale Alzheimer’s data that have not been found using standard approaches. We propose here a comprehensive biomedical computing and health informatics research project to develop and apply cutting-edge AI algorithms and biomedical software for the analysis of large- scale AD data. At the heart of this proposed informatics program is the PennAI method and software for automating machine learning through an AI algorithm that can learn from prior analyses. This approach takes the guesswork out of picking the right machine learning algorithms and parameter settings thus making this computing technology accessible to everyone. Specifically, we will develop three novel informatics methods to tailor PennAI to the analysis of AD data. First, we will develop a Multi-Modal Interaction (M2I) feature selection algorithm for identifying genetic interactions that are predictive of AD (AIM 1). Second, we will develop a Knowledge-driven Multi-omics Integration (KMI) algorithm for combining omics features for AI analysis of AD (AIM 2). Third, we will develop a Multidimensional Brain Imaging Omics (MBIO) integration framework for the joint analysis of multi-source large-scale data for predicting AD. Finally, we will integrate all three biomedical informatics methods into our open-source PennAI software package and apply it to two large population-based studies of AD. We expect PennAI will reveal new biomarkers for AD that will open the door for better treatments and clinical decision support. There have been no new FDA-approved drugs for Alzheimer’s disease in more than 20 years. The goal of this project is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for extracting unforeseen patterns from clinical, genetic, genomic, and imaging data that could lead to ideas for new drug development.

"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for

"Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Considerable efforts have been spent in the past two decades to search for biomarkers for pre-symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For neuroimaging, amyloid-PET imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is considered an early marker for the preclinical stage of AD, while tau-PET imaging correlates more closely with neuronal injury and cognitive decline. However, PET scans are expensive and involve radioactive tracers. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies in AD have shown that the functional connectivity (FC) of resting brain networks is progressively diminished in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. However, FC analysis of rs-fMRI has limited capability to characterize the dynamic fluctuations of rs-fMRI signals that possess clinically meaningful information. Our group and others have recently explored the use of entropy measures as indices of the complexity and regularity of rs-fMRI time-series. Accumulating data showed decreasing entropy values associated with aging, APOE ɛ4 genotype, cognitive decline in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD). Our group began developing the Complexity Toolbox in 2013 as the first systematic and comprehensive software package dedicated to complexity analysis of neuroimaging (fMRI) data. In particular, a recent independent study using our toolbox to analyze the rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study reported progressive reductions of entropy from healthy controls, early MRI, to late MCI and AD groups, with significant associations between complexity measures of rs-fMRI and cognitive decline in MCI/AD subjects. Our preliminary data in ADAD and LOAD subjects further showed consistent negative correlations between rs-fMRI entropy and tau-PET signal. The goal of this project is to further develop our Complexity Toolbox and a cloud-based pipeline for comprehensive complexity analysis of (large scale) fMRI data. We will systematically evaluate the complexity of fMRI as a novel imaging marker of AD in both ADAD and LOAD populations, using 3 public databases of rs- fMRI and PET including Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), Connectome of ADAD, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) with a total sample size >900. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning techniques to evaluate complexity of rs-fMRI as a predictor for transversion from healthy to MCI and to AD. We will generate a disease staging model based on multimodal AD biomarkers including PET, CSF and rs-fMRI measures. We hypothesize that the complexity of BOLD signals provides an index of the information processing capacity of regional neuron populations, and is therefore sensitive to tau- related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD processes. The successful completion of this project will lead to a noninvasive, economical and alternative imaging biomarker of neuronal injury in MCI and AD with relevant tools ready to be deployed in clinical research and care of AD. Relevance to Public Health Biomarkers for pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become increasingly important for the development of preventative interventions. For neuroimaging, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein provide early imaging markers of AD and can track disease progression but are expensive and require the use of radioactive tracers. This project aims to develop and evaluate a noninvasive, quantitative and economical imaging marker of AD based on the complexity or regularity of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).",Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease,10137871,R01AG066711,"['Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', '

"Identification of Mild Cognitive Impairment using Machine Learning from Language and Behavior Markers Project Summary Recent estimates indicate that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may rank as the third leading cause of death for older people in the United States, just behind heart disease and cancer. While scientists know that AD involves a progressive brain cell failure, the reason why cells fail is still not clear. To understand the progression of the disease, one of the keys is to investigate the cognitive changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Even though biomarkers such as imaging and clinical functions are found to be outstanding in differentiating AD patients from those with normal cognition (NC), studies suggest that their discriminative power in early-stage MCI are rather limited. Detecting signals which distinguish subjects with MCI from those with NC is challenging due to the low sensitivity and high variability of current clinical measures such as annually assessed neuropsychological test results and self-reported functional measurements. Moreover, even though in-vivo biomarkers such as beta-amyloid and tau can be used as indicators of pathological progression towards AD, the screening of biomarkers are prohibitively expensive to be widely used among pre-symptomatic individuals in the outpatient setting. We hypothesize that progressive cognitive impact from MCI has elicited detectable changes in the way people talk and behave, which can be sensed by inexpensive and accessible sensors and leveraged by machine learning (ML) algorithms to build predictive models for quantifying the risk of MCI. Our preliminary results on a small cohort indicated that there are significant differences between MCI and NC subjects during a semi-structured conversation, and ML algorithms can use such differences for differentiating MCI and NC with promising performance. Our preliminary results in behavior monitoring also suggest highly predictive performance using temporal patterns of behavior signals. In this project, we plan to build upon our initial success and conduct comprehensive studies on language and behavior markers in larger-scale cohorts to build high-performance and interpretable ML models for screening MCI. Our three Specific Aims are: (1) Discover language markers and develop predictive models characterizing MCI. Using interview recordings from the I-CONECT project, we will use natural language processing and ML algorithms to extract linguistic and acoustic markers and develop multi- modal learning algorithms to fuse the two types of information. (2) Discover behavior markers and develop predictive models characterizing MCI. Using the in-home monitoring data from ORCATECH, we will extract short-term and long-term behavior patterns and integrate multi-granularity behavior markers to differentiate MCI and NC. (3) Linking language and behavior markers with an information framework. We will use demographics and common clinical information to profile the patients and match the two cohorts via certain similarity metrics, creating complementary features for improved prediction. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently affects more than 5 million Americans and leads to progressive memory loss without effective treatments to date. Early and accurate identification of its prodromal state, mild cognitive impairment, are critical for clinical-trial enrichment as well as early intervention of the AD. In this project, we propose to discover cost-effective and user-friendly language and behavior markers signaling MCI and integrating the markers into effective machine learning models for the detection of MCI.",Identification of Mild Cognitive Impairment using Machine Learning from Language and Behavior Markers,10212669,RF1AG072449,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Computers ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Oregon ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' Measures ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Test Result ', ' American ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Health Sciences ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' information framework ', ' cost effective ', ' user-friendly ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' Alzheimer screening ', ' demographics ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' walking speed ', ' walking pace ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' deep learning ', ' deep reinforcement learning ', ' aging and technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,2286356,MI-08
"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,10167595,R01AG059507,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Spinal Puncture ', ' Lumbar Puncture ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' Measures ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' cored plaque ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep illness ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Napping ', ' response ', ' sleep onset ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Drug Testing/Development ', ' Clinical Drug Development ', ' Collection ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' amyloid imaging ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' Alzheimer screening ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' theranostics ', ' screening ', "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', "" Alzheimer's biomarker "", "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' sleep pattern ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,384934,MO-01
"Genetic and molecular correlates of white matter pathology in Alzheimers disease PROJECT SUMMARY: Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically defined by the accumulation of beta- amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration, the disease is not restricted to the gray matter. Neuroimaging and neuropathological studies have documented a significant loss of white matter in AD, which begins early in the disease course and is correlated with cognitive decline. In addition to contributions of hypoperfusion-related ischemic injury and neurodegeneration-associated axonal loss, emerging evidence indicates a decline and dysfunction of oligodendrocyte populations as additional factors in this multifactorial white matter disease process. Oligodendrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the brain, but are the least studied cell population in the context of neurodegeneration despite their vital role for myelin maintenance and neuronal support. With the increasing recognition of the role of myelin in AD, it becomes important to understand the genetic and molecular factors that link oligodendrocytes to the AD process. Our knowledge about genetic variants contributing to overall AD risk and influencing AD-associated endophenotypes is accelerating. Our proposal is designed to bring these two lines of investigation together and begin to explore genetic modifiers of oligodendrocyte and myelin abnormalities in AD and underlying molecular mechanisms using a quantitative trait approach of neuropathologically defined myelin endophenotypes.  The central hypothesis of our proposal is that loss of myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte dysfunction in AD are associated with genetic variants and molecular changes. We will test this hypothesis by first performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of white and gray matter neuropathological endophenotypes in human postmortem brain tissue samples and will then conduct bulk and spatially defined gene expression studies to explore underlying molecular mechanisms. Our experiments are divided into two specific aims: Aim 1) To determine genetic modifiers of myelin and oligodendrocyte pathologies in AD. Aim 2) To determine associations between white matter gene expression changes and white matter pathologies in AD.  The above aims benefit from the tight integration and leveraging of a diverse group of investigators with expertise in the neuropathology of AD and digitally quantified pathology endophenotypes (PI Kofler), AD- associated oligodendrocyte pathology (Co-I Herrup), GWAS data analysis (Co-Is Kamboh and Fan), biostatistical analysis of transcriptomics datasets (Co-I Ding) and digital image analysis and machine learning (Co-I Pearce). Upon completion of our proposed studies, we will have identified novel candidate genes as mediators of myelin pathology in AD, increased our understanding about the biology underlying their linkage to AD and revealed novel targets for therapeutic interventions. As our study design includes separate analyses of gray and white matter regions and stratification by sex, we will have further delineated regional and sex- specific differences in myelin and oligodendrocyte pathobiology in the context of AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Alzheimer's disease is not restricted to the gray matter regions of the brain but also affects the white matter, and these changes contribute to cognitive decline. We propose to evaluate the contributions of genetic variants to the development of oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelin integrity loss in Alzheimer’s disease using postmortem human tissue samples. We will then conduct gene expression studies to identify underlying molecular mechanisms.",Genetic and molecular correlates of white matter pathology in Alzheimers

"Beta-Amyloid Clearance Mapping in Alzheimer’s Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that can be characterized by brain imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). MRI explains the structural changes, while PET measures represent plaque deposits in the brain according to the disease progression. The plaque deposition reflects early AD pathophysiology and presumably caused by a decrease in the removal rate of beta-amyloid through the cleaning systems of the brain. Recent studies have suggested the potential role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in carrying waste from brain tissue to the cleaning system. However, it is still not well understood how CSF flow in the brain affects waste removal. Therefore, the proposed multidisciplinary research project will involve the collaboration of investigators from diverse and complementary backgrounds (a biomechanical engineer, an MR physicist, a neuroradiologist, and cognitive neuroscientists) to address CSF flow-related AD pathophysiology. To analyze CSF flow in the narrow space between the skull and brain tissue (subarachnoid space [SAS]), we will employ computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling technique and correlate CSF flow with neuroimaging markers measured by MRI and PET. Here, the overarching hypothesis is, “Disturbed CSF flow in the SAS leads to the deposition of Amyloid plaque.” To test the hypothesis, we will take the following two steps: 1) Fifty healthy older adults will be recruited for an MRI scan. Based on anatomical and CSF velocity information measured by MRI, three-dimensional flow dynamic properties in SAS will be analyzed through CFD simulation, 2) The simulated CSF properties will be correlated with local amyloid plaque deposition by taking advantage of PET imaging data from the NIH-funded parent study (Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center). Here, we will propose a new imaging marker for amyloid removal for each functional brain region by combining imaging, CFD, and clinical measures. As an alternative approach, in case the new imaging markers are not useful in healthy older adults due to the small sample size, we will apply the CFD model to larger datasets for early AD adults. At the completion of this project, a new imaging tool to quantify CSF flow in the SAS and evaluate its effects on amyloid deposition and removal will be proposed. AD pathophysiology at an early stage in older adults can be analyzed using the proposed approach. Ultimately, this project will provide a biomechanical framework for the design and test of interventional and surgical procedures for the treatment of AD. The developed software programs and imaging protocols will be shared through a public software development/sharing platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which involves structural changes as well as plaque deposits in the brain. In this research, we will develop a novel way to analyze the risk of plaque deposition and test its clinical utility. Our research will provide additional scientific insights into AD pathophysiology and improve the diagnosis of neurological diseases at an earlier stage and their monitoring over time.",Beta-Amyloid

"NOVEL EXOSOME BIOMARKERS OF IRON PATHOLOGY IN AD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) afflicts millions of Americans, yet no effective treatments exist. Iron has been shown to be involved in key AD pathologic processes, including amyloid and tau aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death mechanisms. Despite this growing evidence, it is challenging to ascertain alterations in iron metabolism in vivo, limiting potential translation to biomarkers and novel therapies. Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles shed by cells to transport proteins, nucleic acids, metals, lipids or metabolites. While exosomes reflect cellular processes and can reveal disease-related pathologies in human tissues and biofluids, iron abnormalities in AD exosomes have not yet been investigated. We will address this knowledge gap through state-of-the-art exosome isolation technology combined with advanced iron imaging, protein quantification and next generation sequencing methods. Our goal is to investigate iron dysregulation in exosomes from post- mortem AD brains, in order to unveil AD-specific biomarkers and facilitate the development of novel therapies.  The project aims are: (1) To determine whether the quantity, oxidation state, and cellular origin of exosomal iron is altered in AD. Using MRI and synchrotron X-ray microscopy, we will quantify tissue iron content and oxidation state in human AD and control hippocampal specimens. We will then use our novel exosome isolation platform, ExoTIC, to isolate exosomes from regions of high hippocampal iron content in the same specimens. Using antibodies that target cell-surface proteins, we will enrich the isolated exosomes based on their cellular origin (e.g. neurons, microglia, etc.). We will quantify exosomal iron content from each cell type using mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and measure exosomal iron oxidation state using electron microscopy. Taken together, we will determine whether iron content and oxidation state are altered in Alzheimer’s exosomes compared to controls, in particular in exosomes originating in microglia, the brain’s immune cells. (2) Detect dysregulation of iron-related proteins and RNAs in AD exosomes. Using Western blotting on the enriched exosomes, we will determine whether levels of proteins that play a role in iron metabolism are altered in AD compared to controls. Because exosomes are generally rich in microRNAs that are known to regulate gene expression, we will use RNA-Seq to determine whether exosomal microRNAs regulating these same iron-related proteins are also altered in AD. Machine learning algorithms will enable the creation of an atlas of microRNAs linking iron, iron-related proteins, and neuropathology, which should provide a deeper understanding of AD biology.  Characterization of exosome content in the AD brain should result in cell-specific signatures of iron dysregulation associated with neurodegeneration. This approach may elucidate novel aspects of AD biology, lead to novel assays to detect early AD, and facilitate a much-needed future therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence and cost, investigations focusing on abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) have yet to yield an efficacious treatment, so alternative mechanisms need to be investigated. Iron dysregulation is widespread in AD yet is difficult to quantify in living humans using existing methods: we propose to investigate iron dysregulation using exosomes, tiny vesicles shed from brain cells that offer unique information on active cellular processes. Using a novel exosome isolation platform integrated with advanced iron imaging and next generation sequencing, we will identify signatures of iron dysregulation associated with brain cells in AD, which can provide novel pharmaceutical targets towards a much-needed future therapy.",NOVEL EXOSOME BIOMARKERS OF IRON PATHOLOGY IN AD,10223789,R21AG072675,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ',

"Predictive analytics for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a major global healthcare burden. However, there is still no effective disease modifying therapy for AD and clinical trials with the aim of preventing or stabilizing cognitive impairment have largely failed. Decision making in both clinical practice and research is highly dependent on practical predictive tools, which can effectively predict cognitive or functional outcomes in individuals. Such models could be potentially used in clinical research to boost the power of trials by enrollment of participants who are most likely to show disease progression during the trial’s timeframe. Alternatively, these models could be used to identifying individuals who would benefit from primary or secondary prevention once there are effective treatments for AD. In this project, we aim to provide a framework for practical prediction of cognitive decline with aging and prodromal AD, by applying a novel ML framework to multiple dimensions of data (demographics, genetic risk scores, neuropsychological measures, structural MRI, and amyloid imaging). Our ultimate goal is to arrive at a new “Machine Learning predictive framework for aging and AD” (ML4AD), comprised of dimensions each of which each will add incremental value to the predictive models, hence increasing the performance of predictive models while keeping the costs and burden of research at a minimum. The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23), Dr. Ali Ezzati, is a Neurologist whose career goal is to develop predictive tools to help research and clinical decision making in cognitive aging and dementia. The proposed research will leverage the rich clinical and biomarker dataset available from several ongoing international studies, but will also provide a unique avenue of investigation for the candidate. The candidate's career development will benefit from close mentorship and scientific guidance of outstanding investigators in aging/AD neurobiology (Dr. Lipton), machine learning and computational neuroscience (Dr. Davatzikos), and biostatistics (Dr. Hall). The findings from this study will inform future secondary prevention trials, in which sensitive indicators of early AD will be necessary to identify high-risk subjects and track early clinical decline. This work will serve as the foundation to move forward in independent research focusing on development of predictive tools in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. Key words: Alzheimer’s Disease, Dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Cognitive neurology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Longitudinal Cohort, Big Data Project Narrative This project aims to develop new models for prediction of cognitive outcomes including cognitive change and incident Alzheimer’s disease. Prediction models will be developed by applying advanced machine learning techniques to high-dimensional data including clinical, neuropsychological, genetic, and biomarker data. This approach will lead to predictive tools that can be effectively used in research as well as clinical decision making for patients in prodromal stages of Alzheimer’s disease or individuals with

"Circadian Organization and Disorder in Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT With an aging population, the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on public health continues to explode. Altered daily rhythms in physiology and behavior are prominent features of AD. These altered activity rhythms are difficult to treat, disrupting the lives of both patients and caregivers. Mounting evidence suggests that these changes are more than just symptoms. Altered rhythms may contribute to AD progression and development. Many important transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with a daily cycle. Understanding these rhythms, and their influence on AD, offers the potential to identify new therapies. The translation of circadian biology to Alzheimer's care is limited. Which molecules and pathways show daily rhythms in our human brains? How do those rhythms change with AD? Do changes in molecular rhythms explain changing behavioral patterns? Can these rhythms be exploited for therapeutic benefit? To answer clinical questions, we need human data. AD brain banks provide an invaluable resource. But brain banks almost never provide the time of day when patients died, making it difficult to use these data for rhythms research. We developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure), a machine-learning tool to uncover molecular rhythms using unordered biopsy samples. Evaluating brain expression data, we showed that CYCLOPS could correctly reconstruct rhythms in brain samples and correctly predict the time of death. Here we will order cortical brain samples from control subjects and patients with AD. We will reconstruct the molecular rhythms in these human brains, identifying differences in AD patients and rhythms in known drug targets and AD disease pathways. We will analyze a subset of samples where time of death is known, comparing each subject's “internal molecular time” with the “time on the clock.” We will test the hypothesis that patients with poorly aligned molecular rhythms are more likely to have circadian behavioral disturbance. We will evaluate a measure of transcriptional rhythm strength, testing if “weaker” rhythms predict behavioral or molecular misalignment. Does AD alter rhythm generation? Does it desynchronize still rhythmic cells and brain regions? Using data from multiple brain regions sampled from the same subjects, we will evaluate intracortical circadian synchrony and compare AD patients with controls. Using single-nucleus sequencing data, we will explore the effect of AD on cell type specific rhythms and their synchrony. Finally, we will test the direct influence of important AD causing mutations on molecular clock function, measuring rhythms in isolated cells. This work will advance our understanding of circadian rhythms in AD pathology, clarify the relationship between behavioral and molecular circadian disruption, and catalyze opportunities for AD chronotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep and circadian disruption are prominent features of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. This work will help researchers understand how molecular rhythms in the brain may influence the progression of AD, contribute to the sleep disruption experienced by AD patients, and influence the time at which AD targeted medications will be most effective.",Circadian Organization and Disorder in Alzheimer's Disease,10220845,R01AG068577,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', '

"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET-positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations), 200 subjects meeting clinical criteria with negative amyloid PET (EOnonAD) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). EOnonAD participants and controls will also receive [18]FDG PET. All participants are followed annually (controls up to 24 months; impaired participants up to 48 months). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD and EOnonAD and compare to age-matched controls and sex and stage- matched LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. Additionally, we will characterize demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarker measures in EOnonAD cases to explore the possible etiologies of cognitive impairment. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow 600 people with EOAD and related disorders in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study

"Brain entropy mapping in Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has affected tens of millions of people but remains incurable. The major risk factor for AD is aging, which entails high brain entropy due to the progressive brain damages. Notably, the brain constantly consumes a large amount of energy to maintain its functional integrity, likely creating a big “reserve” to counteract the high entropy. Malfunctions of this reserve may indicate a critical point of disease conversion and progression. Reserve malfunction can be measured by the compensation outcome: functional brain entropy (fBEN), which may reveal critical information for bridging the knowledge gap between AD pathology and clinical symptoms: AD pathology begins long before AD symptoms and may not lead to dementia, and may provide a brain marker for early disease detection. This project is proposed to characterize fBEN in normal aging and the AD continuum and test an inverse U-shape fBEN model: fBEN increases with age and AD pathology in normal aging but decreases in the AD continuum. We will test the model using large existing resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. Our group started rsfMRI-based fBEN mapping in 2010 and released the first open-source fBEN mapping tool. The tool has been widely used in many neuroscientific and translational studies. To be scalable for large data, we will develop a further accelerated version in this project. In Aim 1, we will calculate fBEN using data from 2000+ young and old healthy individuals from public databases and examine the associations of fBEN to age, education, and cognitive function. We hypothesize that the brain has a reserve-related network whose fBEN decreases with years of education and is negatively correlated with brain function, suggesting low fBEN in this network as an indicator of brain reserve. Aim 2 will characterize fBEN in AD and assess its associations to AD pathology and clinical symptoms. We hypothesize that there is a strong pathology vs disease interaction on fBEN: fBEN increases with age and pathology in normal aging and lower fBEN correlates with better cognition; those associations will be reversed in the AD continuum so that fBEN will decrease with pathology level and lower fBEN will correlate to worse cognition. Aim 3 will evaluate the feasibility of baseline fBEN in regions elucidated in Aims 1 and 2 for early disease detection. Because fBEN may only reflect some part of the functional abnormalities in AD, we will combine fBEN with other imaging biomarkers in the model in order to achieve higher prediction accuracy. We will also build a model to use fBEN to predict AD pathology in normal aging. The clinical impact of this project includes: 1) testing the hypothetical fBEN model will help delineate the pathology vs clinical discrepancy in AD; 2) finding the disease related fBEN patterns may provide a potential intervention target; 3) testing the prediction model will aid early disease detection; 4) AD pathology prediction is of great clinical value for normal aging and AD management as current AD pathology measurement is either painful or too expensive. The feasibility of this novel project and the many new hypotheses have been initially demonstrated by our extensive preliminary data. Alzheimer’s Disease is a currently incurable brain disease. Brain entropy is an important trait of brain function and may provide critical information for unveiling neuromechanisms of complex disorders like AD. Using large existing data, this project will examine brain entropy change in AD and to assess brain entropy as a potential biomarker for AD. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact.",Brain entropy mapping in Alzheimer's

"Decoding the impact of sex differences on Alzheimer's disease risk Decoding the Impact of Sex Differences on Alzheimer’s Disease Risk The molecular basis and genetic architecture of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remain poorly defined. Solving these problems is further complicated by the differences that exist between men and women with respect to the prevalence, onset, progression and comorbidities of AD, suggesting that some contributing genetic variants are sex-specific. So far, mixed-gender Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked over 100 loci with AD. These loci explain much of the population-attributable risk but just a fraction of heritability, and with no distinction between men and women. It is unlikely that this heritability gap would improve just by splitting studies by sex, however, since separate analyses on about half as many patients would be less powerful. Rather, in order to design effective surveillance, screening, preventive, and stratification programs tailored to each sex, there is a critical need for more sensitive and accurate methods, able to compute the link between genetic variants and AD risk separately and specifically in men and women. To do so, we propose an integrative computational approach that will be validated by experimental and translational studies of candidate genes. Rather than seek individual variants, we focus instead on genes and their coding regions. In order to increase the power of our studies, we developed an unbiased evolution-based continuous score for the functional impact of any coding variant, from 0 (neutral) to 1 (complete loss of function). Using this scoring system adds to the usual analyses of human variants a vast number of amino acid mutation experiments already performed by evolution over billions of years, with each mutation being tied to a functional readout based on the context of its phylogenetic divergence. With this score, we now propose to identify genes that carry significantly more impactful coding variants in AD women, or AD men, compared to sex-matched controls. The gain in statistical power of this approach compared to GWAS has been demonstrated in preliminary data. In Aim 1 we propose to discover sex-specific AD genes on more than 1000 Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) men and 1400 ADSP women; and in Aim 2 to discover sex-specific modifiers of APOE. Aim 3 will include validation of computationally-derived candidate genes in human brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and thorough experimental characterization in AD animal-models (mouse and Drosophila). Together, this combination of novel, integrative computational approaches and multi-model systems validation experiments will yield new biomarkers that improve sex-specific risk stratification of AD status and reveal differences in disease mechanisms between women and men that highlight potential therapeutic targets specific to each. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not exactly the same in women and in men, so that in order to design more effective surveillance, screening, preventive, and risk assessment programs, we need new methods that are sensitive and accurate enough to detect differences in how genetic variants are linked to AD risk in women and men. For this we propose a variety of new statistical and machine learning tools that will interpret the variants observed in human genomes from patients in light of the entire history of past evolutionary mutations and adaptations. The best candidate genes we find will then be tested experimentally in AD animal-models (mouse and Drosophila) to yield highly validated sex-specific predictors of AD status that could enable precise risk stratification, provide sex-specific biomarkers, highlight sex-differential disease mechanisms and reveal potential therapeutic targets.",Decoding the impact of sex differences on Alzheimer's

"Digital biomarker for a low cost ambulatory test for early detection of Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Presently, no established biomarker exists to robustly predict the clinical manifestation of cognitive symptoms in persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias. PET and MRI brain biomarkers are costly and invasive, thus there is a critical need for a noninvasive, inexpensive, and portable AD screening tool that can be easily deployed in-home or in residential communities. While non-brain signals characterizing biological and behavioral traits may prove valuable, two types of brain signal also hold strong promise as digital biomarkers of early stages of AD: epileptogenic activity (EA), and aberrant functional brain networks. Importantly, both biomarkers can be collected affordably and reliably with the latest dry-electrode ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) technology. AD patients have a tenfold higher seizure prevalence compared to the general population (Pandis and Scarmeas, 2012); however, the use of EA as an AD digital biomarker is largely unexplored. It is also well known that amnestic MCI (aMCI) and AD patients show subtle functional network disruptions that are promising predictors of AD, as shown by our group (e.g Pusil et al., 2019) and others, but there is no previous research assessing the joint impact between EA and functional networks. The scientific premise of this proposal is two-fold: (i) a combinatorial EA and functional network biomarker will predict conversion from aMCI to AD more robustly than a single signal in isolation, and (ii) a novel deep learning model that performs multimodal (MEG and EEG) learning to find shared signatures of AD, but ultimately yields a model that needs affordable EEG-only data, will yield a powerful biomarker. This proposal will pursue three specific aims. 1) Identify specific features of EA that prognosticate aMCI conversion; 2) Design a digital biomarker that predicts aMCI conversion from EA features and functional brain networks; 3) Extend the digital biomarker to ambulatory EEG with dry electrode technology. To achieve these aims, we will collect MEG, wet-electrode EEG, and dry-electrode (ambulatory) EEG data from 200 aMCI patients, evaluate their signals with expert epileptologists, and monitor the patient’s yearly conversion rate to AD. We will then design and validate a deep learning model called Siamese Multiple Graph to Gauss (SMG2G), which performs multimodal learning on MEG and EEG network (graph) data but ultimately yields a model that needs EEG-only data to make predictions of aMCI conversion. The final product will be a dry-electrode ambulatory EEG digital biomarker that can be readily measured in home or in a residential facility. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it is the first to combine EA and functional network signals to design an AD biomarker and achieves this by cutting- edge machine learning. It is also significant because it will advance the field vertically both scientifically and clinically by enabling large-scale, early detection of AD. Our team is especially well-prepared to undertake this project, with clinical and engineering expertise, strong collaboration over the years, with preliminary data supporting the aims, and institutional support. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops a new biomarker to predict early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using machine learning technology applied to cutting-edge dry-electrode ambulatory electroencephalography data. Prediction will rely on the development and validation of a state-of- the-art system that combines epileptogenic activity and functional brain networks. Once such a biomarker has been developed, this will provide the basis for a noninvasive, inexpensive, and portable AD screening tool that can be easily deployed in-home or in residential

"Motor Profiles as Novel Biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Established biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as amyloid beta measured with PET, are expensive and invasive. Cost-efficient, quick, and easy-to-administer motor measures, such as grip strength and walking speed, have shown to precede the cognitive symptoms of AD by several years. Relative to single measures, combining ambulatory and strength measures boosts predictive value for AD. This suggests that a composite motor profile score that weighs functions spanning the breadth of motor domains will have optimal predictive power. Cognitive and motor brain regions that are known to degenerate early (e.g., the hippocampus and fornix) and later in the AD disease process (e.g., the cerebellum, (pre)motor cortex, and corticospinal tract) are candidates for the prediction of motor dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The objective of this K01 proposal is two-fold: 1) to further develop the research skills of the applicant with a series of mentored activities, and 2) to identify the behavioral and neural motor profiles of MCI and AD with the aim of developing a robust and valid risk scoring algorithm. Our central hypothesis is that a motor behavioral composite score and neural motor profile score distinguish individuals with MCI and AD from healthy control subjects, and are related to established AD biomarkers (amyloid burden, hippocampal volume, and APOE e4 status). The project has three specific aims: 1) Quantify behavioral and neural motor dysfunction in MCI and AD; 2) Identify behavioral and neural motor composite scores as novel AD biomarkers; and 3) Replicate a motor composite score as AD biomarker in a large independent sample from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging.  The training plan aims to establish expertise in areas that are crucial for the candidate to conduct the proposed research and to become an independent investigator in the field of AD. The following training goals have been identified in close collaboration with the mentoring team: a) establishing a clinical perspective and the conceptual framework required to implement effective research in MCI and AD; b) develop expertise in machine learning relevant to prediction modeling; c) gaining an in-depth understanding of neurological motor signs and function in MCI and AD; and d) develop expertise on AD biomarkers and their perceived role in AD etiology. The training will be closely supervised by clinical experts of AD (Dr. Duff), and leaders in the field of neural motor dysfunction in aging (Dr. Rosano), AD biomarkers (Dr. Foster), MCI risk factors (Dr. Kremen), and machine learning (Dr. Tasdizen). The candidate's optimal institutional environment further ensures the success of the training and research plan that will provide data for an R01 application on the prediction of MCI to AD transition from a motor profile composite score. The proposed research makes a significant contribution towards the development of novel cost-efficient AD biomarkers that can serve to enrich clinical trials and for diagnostic purposes, consistent with the mission of the NIA. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) often suffer from motor problems such as slowness and loss of strength. Constructing a composite score of multiple motor domains in AD can result in a marker that could be used to indicate the risk to develop the disease.

"Optogenetic dissection of cellular and circuit mechanisms of network dysfunction and amyloid deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in vivo SUMMARY A contributing factor to the failure of clinical trials has been the translational limitations of transgenic (TG) overexpression models in which physiological and endogenously-regulated pathogenic interactions are not achieved. In addition, standard behavioral tests may lack sensitivity to identify robust and reproducible behavioral deficits in newly develop knock-in (KI) models. To address or mitigate these limitations, we propose to study the next generation of newly developed KI mouse models of AD without transgene overexpression using the latest machine learning approaches for behavioral phenotyping and chronic wireless EEG/EMG recordings. Specifically, we propose to study knock-in (KI) mice that express humanized Ab under the control of the mouse App locus with or without FAD mutations, including AppAβ/Aβ, AppNL-F/NL-F, and AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice using state-of- the-art chronic in vivo electrophysiological recordings and machine learning approaches for behavioral phenotyping. The parent grant heavily focuses on the J20 TG model of AD, because App-KI mice show no prominent cognitive deficits in standard behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze test,10 and because it is unknown if App-KI have robust network abnormalities described in J20 and other TG-APP mouse models and AD patients, including altered gamma oscillations, theta-gamma coupling, epileptiform spikes and seizures.1,3,9,11- 15. The proposed experiments and genotypes expand the focus of our parent grant and will develop tools and procedures that will be directly used by the parent grant to improve behavioral and brain network characterization of TG and KI models of AD. We propose the following aims: Aim 1. Develop and apply machine learning approaches to identify behavioral alterations in late-onset AppAβ/Aβ and early-onset AppNL-F/NL-F and AppNL-G-F/NL- G-F AD mice. Aim 2. Determine electrophysiological phenotypes by chronic wireless EEG/EMG recordings during aging and disease progression in late-onset AppAβ/Aβ and early-onset AppNL-F/NL-F and AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F AD mice. Aim 3. Determine relationships between behavioral alterations and neuronal network dysfunction in late-onset AppAβ/Aβ and early-onset AppNL-F/NL-F and AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F AD mice. In addition, this diversity supplement grant will significantly enhance the research potential of the candidate and further her ability to pursue a research career. The candidate will gain valuable relevant experience with electrophysiological data analysis and mouse behavioral assays during the funding period. These novel in vivo approaches and technical skills will help the candidate to address unexplored questions of AD pathogenesis, thereby creating a technical and conceptual path towards independence. The proposed supplement will provide the conceptual and technological foundation needed to support the production of preliminary data for the candidate’s future F32 grant application.

"Effects of Orally Administered Nicotinamide Riboside on Bioenergetic Metabolism, Oxidative Stress and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer's Dementia Project Summary/Abstract  This study will serve as a supplement to the current NIA funded study “Effects of Orally Administered Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) on Bioenergetic Metabolism, Oxidative Stress and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer’s Dementia”. The primary study will assess the effect of NR supplementation on oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and downstream markers of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in the brain of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The study will use NAD+ and redox ratio changes as the primary outcome and changes in CK/ATPase activity and glutathione levels in the brain as the secondary outcome. The parent study will also assess the impact of NR supplementation on mood and functioning as measured by standardized tests of mood, cognition, and daily functioning. However, these outcome measures for these markers of clinical and functional status are all self- or observer-reported measures that are subject to associated limitations, including fewer data points, recall bias, responder bias, require the presence and engagement of an observer, and include no measures to capture variations using continuous measurement in vivo.  We propose a novel approach to augment the current outcome measures with continuous sensor data to facilitate digital phenotyping of functioning and mood using a sensor called Emerald. Emerald uses radio signals to map motion, spatial location and sleep patterns in patients with AD and requires no direct interaction or contact and can collect continuous passive behavioral data. Customized machine-learning algorithms will extract (i) sleep efficiency, (ii) gait speed, and (iii) diurnal rhythm. The Emerald device can also track spatial location within the living environment and quantify levels and patterns of motion, which in turn are markers of psychomotor activity. These variables will facilitate a continuous, temporally dense and highly ecologically valid assessment of day-to-day variations in functioning to augment the data currently being collected. Sensor data will also allow continuous longitudinal mapping of behavioral/functional changes and comparison of trends of change in each individual variable.  We will deploy the Emerald device in the living environment of consenting study subjects and collect data on sleep and behavior for the duration of their enrolment in the parent trial. While the study requires visits at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks, the Emerald will track functioning and mood between visits, chronological patterns of behavior, and functional change in response to NR administration. The Emerald device will be deployed in forty study participants. Due to the small sample size, this is exploratory, but the data generated using digital phenotyping will enable us to develop and test hypotheses about the relationship between NR supplementation, bioenergetics/oxidative stress, imaging markers, and real-world functioning/clinical outcomes in future studies of AD and mild cognitive impairment. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Emerald device passively gathers continuous data on motion, spatial location, psychomotor activity, and sleep patterns in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), allowing longitudinal mapping of their behavioral and functional changes over time. Machine learning algorithms will extract patients’ sleep efficiency, gait speed, and diurnal rhythms to assess changes in their behavior and functioning, capturing in vivo variations possibly attributable to nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation. This administrative supplement will enable us to develop and test hypotheses about the relationship between NR supplementation, bioenergetics and oxidative stress, imaging markers, and real-world functioning/clinical outcomes that will benefit future studies of AD.","Effects of Orally Administered Nicotinamide Riboside on Bioenergetic Metabolism, Oxidative Stress and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer's Dementia",10394467,R01AG066670,"['ATP phosphohydrolase ', ' ATPase ', ' Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Adenosinetriphosphatase ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Bed Occupancy ', ' bed days ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chronology ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Glutathione ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ', ' Dihydronicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide ', ' Diphosphopyridine Nucleotide ', ' Nadide ', ' Nicotinamide-Adenine Dinucleotide ', ' NADH ', ' Persons ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Oxides ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' nicotinamide-beta-riboside ', ' nicotinamide ribonucleoside ', ' nicotinamide ribose ', ' nicotinamide riboside ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' functional status ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Radio ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standardize measure ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' Gait speed ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' sleep behavior ', ' sleep habit ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' diurnal variation ', ' sleep pattern ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' nicotinamide riboside supplementation ', ' ']",NIA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,313981,MA-05
"Endophenotype Network-based Approaches to Prediction and Population-based Validation of In Silico Drug Repurposing for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Although researchers have conducted more than 400 human trials for potential treatments of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the last two decades, the attrition rate is estimated at over 99%. Furthermore, the “one gene, one drug, one disease” reductionism-informed paradigm overlooks the inherent complexity of the disease and continues to challenge drug discovery for AD. The predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. Recent studies have suggested that AD often has common underlying mechanisms and pathobiology, sharing intermediate endophenotypes with many other complex diseases. These endophenotypes, such as amyloidosis, tauopathy and neuroinflammation, have essential roles in many neurodegenerative diseases. Systematic identification and characterization of novel underlying pathogenesis and endophenotype networks, more so than mutated genes, will serve as a foundation for generating actionable targets as input for drug repurposing and rational design of combination therapy in AD. Integration of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and the human interactome using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are essential for such identification. Given our preliminary results, we posit that AI/ML-based identification of likely risk genes and endophenotype network modules offer unexpected opportunities for drug repurposing and combination therapy design in AD compared to traditional single-target approaches. To address the underlying hypothesis, we propose to establish an AI/ML-based, multimodal analytic framework to repurpose existing genetics, genomics and transcriptomics data generated from NIA-funded AD genome sequencing projects for druggable target identification with two specific aims under the scope of the parent R01 (#R01AG066707). The central unifying hypothesis of this Supplement project is that a genome-wide, AI/ML infrastructure that enables users searching, sharing, visualizing, querying, and analyzing multi-omics (including genetics and genomics) findings can enable emerging development of molecularly targeted treatments for AD. Aim 1 will test common variant-based risk gene and endophenotype network hypothesis in AD using multi-omics evidence aggregation under a multiple kernel learning framework and the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable digital objects) principles. We will develop and apply AI/ML approach to identify likely risk genes and endophenotype networks though leveraging genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data from AD Sequencing Project (ADSP), the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), NIAGADS, and the AD knowledge portal. Aim 2 will test cell type-specific risk genes and anti-inflammatory endophenotype network hypothesis in AD using a network-based deep learning framework. Following FAIR principles, we will implement command-line and web portal to disseminate all AI/ML toolboxes and AI/ML-ready gene/network data from Aims 1 and 2 into the AD knowledge portal and the Cleveland Clinic-IBM Quantum computing platform for accelerating future AD genetic and multi-omics data analyses, an essential goal of the Alzheimer’s precision medicine. 1 Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, while the current disease incidence indicates approximately 13.8 million Americans will be affected by 2050 without disease-modifying treatments. This proposal will develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools, capable of searching human genome sequencing findings and existing drug-target databases for novel AD drug target identification and therapeutic development. The innovative AI/ML toolboxes developed in this proposal will offer powerful approaches for NIH-funded multi-omics data analyses and the AI/ML-identified druggable targets will prove to be novel and effective ways for emerging development of molecularly targeted therapies in AD. 1",Endophenotype Network-based Approaches to Prediction and Population-based Validation of In Silico Drug Repurposing

"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents ABSTRACT Citizen science, public participation in the scientific process, leverages the unique properties of human cognition to distribute the analysis of massive data sets to the general public. Recently, the Human Computation Institute (HCI) used this approach to crowdsource the analysis of in-vivo two-photon excitation microscopy (2PEF) data, which has accelerated Cornell University’s Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research by a factor of five, elucidating molecular mechanisms that underlie capillary stalling in mouse models of AD. For this administrative supplement, we now propose to develop and validate a new online platform that crowdsources the histopathological analysis of whole slide images (WSI) of the human brain. This would support the rapid acquisition of high-volume datasets needed to train an automated classifier in support of our existing R01 studies investigating the neuropathological landscape of AD within Hispanic and non-Hispanic White decedents. Deriving research-grade classification labels from multi-source WSI entails data quality requirements that exceed today’s best automated methods. Thus, we intend to develop a crowd-powered analytic pipeline that reduces the histopathological analysis into a step-wise series of manageable online tasks that could be accomplished by non-expert members of the general public, as well as “wisdom of crowd” methods for aggregating many individual answers into a single expert-like answer. In service of these objectives, our specific aims are to develop the process, interfaces, and aggregation methods needed to support the crowd-powered analytic pipeline and evaluate its internal validity. We will employ a repeated cross-validation protocol to test the hypothesis that the crowd-based analysis will result in at least 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity for two major pathology categories (plaques and tangles) relative to gold standard data provided by expert annotators. If these validation studies are successful, an online platform incorporating this analytic pipeline will be used to execute the first ever de novo analysis of Alzheimer’s histopathology imagery by a crowd of volunteers (geared towards those of Hispanic heritage), be used to train a neural network model for automating the analysis, and will support the ongoing improvement of a reusable digital pathology workflow tool that is sensitive to an expanding repertoire of pathology targets. NARRATIVE This proposal will speed up Alzheimer’s research by automating pathology classifications through crowd-based generation of neural network training data. The attendant citizen-science platform will support ongoing improvement of an open digital pathology tool that is sensitive to an expanding repertoire of histopathology targets.

"Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimers Disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by progressive neuropathological changes that begin decades before cognitive and functional symptoms, and thus efforts have been focused on developing innovative tools and biomarkers for early identification of pre-dementia stages. To date, clinical ability to identify those with pre-dementia stages of AD has been limited and requires expensive (Amyloid PET) or invasive (Lumbar Punctures, LP) testing. However, subtle changes in connected speech may be detectable years before overt disease symptoms present. Our team has developed an approach that uses machine learning and natural language processing combined with advanced acoustic phonetic and lexical-semantic analyses. Preliminary data show promise in identifying AD biomarker status and predicting 2-year cognitive progression. In the proposed study, we leverage our success in collecting CSF biomarkers, neuroimaging and detailed cognitive phenotyping combined with audio-recordings of participants in the Brain Stress, Hypertension and Aging Research Program cohort. This cohort, now in its second year of follow-up, consists of 400 individuals 50 years or older with normal cognition or MCI. We plan to extend this cohort of 400 participants for 3 more years to collect additional waves of voice recordings, cognitive assessments, and follow-up CSF biomarkers and neuroimaging. Our overarching hypothesis is that the derived novel features reflecting poor lexical-semantic connectedness or acoustic perturbations are significantly different between biomarker positive and negative participants, have better diagnostic performance than traditional cognitive tests (e.g. confrontation naming), and are associated with a longitudinal change in cognition and AD-related biomarkers. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the accuracy of the derived digital biomarkers in detection of in-vivo AD pathology in the B-SHARP cohort; 2) Investigate longitudinally the association of the derived features with cognitive decline and their ability to reflect changes in AD biomarkers; and 3) using resting state functional MRI, identify the networks in the brain that map to derived lexical semantic and acoustic features with brain connectivity at baseline and during follow-up. This project will provide needed insight into the use of non-invasive digital biomarkers to improve the ability to detect and track longitudinal changes in cognitive and functional status in AD. Recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning offer a unique opportunity to explore highly complex changes in connected speech in the preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the accuracy and diagnostic performance of non-invasive digital biomarkers in detecting and predicting AD biomarker status in individuals with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. It is anticipated that the findings of this project will improve the ability to detect and track longitudinal changes in cognitive and functional status in AD.",Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimers

"A Study of Race Differences in Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Abstract  We propose to combine mass spectrometry and machine learning to address racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. While African Americans have two to three times the incidence rates of AD than people of European Ancestry, they are underrepresented in past and current AD research studies. The lack of representation leads to a weaker understanding of disease progression and poorer diagnostics for this population. The overarching premise, that advances in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease for all Americans will be stymied unless differences among racial groups are considered, is supported by the literature and demonstrated with preliminary data in the application. The aims of this proposal are, therefore, designed to specifically address the need for a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease in minority groups and to increase the diversity of patients that could be correctly diagnosed with serum-based biomarker panels for AD. Successful completion of the proposed research would accomplish several objectives: We would identify optimal feature selection methods for `omics data; generate the best possible plasma biomarker panel for AD in African Americans; and provide a systematic investigation of the extent to which existing MS- `omics studies' accuracy of predicting AD are modulated by the participants' race. Project Narrative: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a better understanding of race-associated differences in Alzheimer's disease so that plasma-based biomarker panels can be developed for a diverse group of Americans.",A Study of Race Differences in Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers,10234957,RF1AG072760,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' APOE e4 ', ' APOE-ε4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' European ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' sex ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', "" Alzheimer's biomarker "", "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' feature selection ', "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' lipidomics ', ' Institutional Racism ', ' Systemic Racism ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,RF1,2021,1123467,KS-02
"South Texas Alzheimer's Disease Center Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD) disproportionally impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who exhibit higher rates, earlier onset and face unique challenges due to cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic or healthcare access problems. Moreover, there is a shortage of researchers focused on ADRD in Mexican- American (MA) Hispanics, the fastest growing minority in the US. Addressing the heterogeneity of ADRD presentation and biology, using precision medicine approaches to improve risk prediction, target prevention and treatment is likely to improve outcomes for MA and others. The proposed South Texas Alzheimer disease Center (STAC) will exploit its unique geographic location in South Texas, a region of ~5 million, underserved MA to develop infrastructure and data/biosample collections that will support researchers from multiple disciplines to conduct research to diminish the burden of AD in Hispanics. We have 6 specific aims: (1) Collecting and sharing longitudinal data from patients, controls and caregivers (2) Exploring the biological heterogeneity of preclinical and clinical dementia, through deep phenotyping with clinical, imaging, genetic, omic, CSF, blood and sensory-motor biomarkers and autopsy of all these enrollees (3) Focusing especially for Aims #1 and #2 on Hispanic/Latino individuals (4) Identifying novel predictors/ biomarkers of dementia risk and resilience, including for poorly understood clinic-pathologic subgroups such as Suspected Non-Alzheimer (amyloid negative, neurodegeneration positive) Pathology [SNAP] in Hispanics with/without diabetes, (5) To recruit, train, mentor and support a diverse research workforce, largely women and minorities, to become leaders in multidisciplinary, team-based, ADRD research, (6) Bidirectional community education and engagement, research into knowledge, attitudes and practices/preferences. The STAC will develop and share culturally sensitive deep phenotyping methods beyond the Uniform Dataset (including novel cognitive, behavioral, vascular, lifestyle factors, biomarkers), genetics and multi- dimensional omics within community- based and patient and caregiver (dyadic) cohorts. Using state of the art clinical informatics and statistical methods, these rich data should permit an exploration of the molecular heterogeneity of ADRD and uncover novel biology and drug targets, treatment approaches. Finally we will collaborate, share data/samples and expertise with other institutions in Texas and around the world, especially other ADRC Centers, the NACC, NCRAD, NIAGADS. We will achieve these aims through creation of six required Cores and one component: Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistical, Neuropathology, Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement, Biomarker Cores and the Research Education Component. In addition, we propose three Optional Cores: Population Neuroscience, Imaging and Genetics and Multiomics Cores. The STAC will serve as a national resource for disruptive, transformative and innovative research and the design, development, testing and implementation of practical strategies to diminish the burden of AD in Hispanics. Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD) disproportionately impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who represent the faster growing segment of the elderly population in the US and particularly in Texas. Building on longstanding strengths in clinical, epidemiological, biomedical, social and behavioral research at the Biggs Institute, University of Texas Health Sciences Center San Antonio (UTHSA) and facilitated by partnership with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valle (UTRGV), the South Texas Alzheimer´s disease Center (STAC) will lead novel precision, personalized medicine approaches to educate, support and improve prevention, treatment and care for patients with ADRD.

"Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade Abstract Enormous effort has been made to uncover the series of changes in biomarkers along Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiological pathway and its later clinical manifestations. The most influential hypothetical model proposed by Jack and colleagues has greatly shaped AD research in the past decade, whereas it remains a hypothesis to be validated. The key challenge in the validation is the fact that AD pathophysiological process is not directly observable. The temporal biomarker profile is therefore usually examined against discrete clinical diagnoses, estimated years from clinical symptom onset or test score of cognitive impairment – neither is a good measure of the AD pathogenic process, but merely clinical consequences that have been shown to vary greatly among individuals and also to be affected by other diseases. In this proposal, we will tackle this topic in the following aspects. (1) We will develop appropriate statistical models that directly address the unobservable nature of the AD pathophysiological process and therefore provide the foundation to operationalize and validate hypothetical AD biomarker models. (2) We will utilize data across multiple AD database to provide data-based evidence on the AD biomarker cascade and its clinical manifestations, as well as inform the link between the newly proposed biological AD definition in the 2018 NIA-AA research guideline and the current syndromic AD definition. (3) We will develop a statistical framework for dynamic prediction of AD pathophysiological progression trajectory and its clinical manifestations based on the history of a patient’s biomarker profiles. (4) We will develop a web-based application that allows for expedited delivery of statistical learning into practice. Although the scientific questions are focused, the proposed statistical model is applicable to many observational studies with longitudinal, multivariate biomarker measures to capture an unobservable structure, such as in aging or mental health studies. Narrative The project develops appropriate statistical methodologies to evaluate temporal biomarker changes along a pathophysiological process that cannot be directly observed, bridge the gap between a rigorous evaluation and the practical constraints using existing data sources, and attempt to provide individualized prediction of a patient’s future progression trajectory and associated clinical manifestations based on the biomarker history of this patient. Methods are motivated by the need to understand the series of changes in biomarkers along the Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiological pathway during the asymptotic stage and its later clinical manifestations, but can be applied to many biomarker studies where the outcome is not directly observable, such as in aging or mental health studies.",Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade,10260514,R01AG068002,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Influentials ', ' Joints ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Process Measure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Sigmoid colon ', ' Sigmoid ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Shapes ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' user-friendly ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' AD model ', ' alzheimer model ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' evidence base ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", ' Formulation ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' semiparametric ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', "" Alzheimer's biomarker "", "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' statistical learning ', ' Visualization ', ' multiple data sources ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409375,MD-07
"Ultrascale Machine Learning to Empower Discovery in Alzheimers Disease Biobanks ABSTRACT In response to PAR-19-269 “Cognitive Systems Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetic and Phenotypic Data (U01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)”, our project unites experts in AD genomics, machine learning and AI (including deep learning), large-scale data integration, and international data harmonization to work in a carefully-designed Consortium Structure in close partnership with the NIH, ADSP, and NIAGADS. We will develop a suite of complementary big data analytic approaches for ultra-scale analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) genomic and phenotypic data. The vast data volumes now generated by the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Accelerating Medications Partnership AD (AMP-AD), and UK Biobank (UKBB), far exceed the capacity of all current analytic methods, which have not kept pace with the scale and speed of data collection. This vast amount of genetic and phenotypic data mandates new and more powerful algorithms to: (1) store, manage, and manipulate whole-genome sequences and associated data on an ever-growing scale; (2) discover novel AD risk and protective loci by merging informatics and AD genomics databases; (3) relate whole-genome changes to the ATN(v) biomarkers that now define biological AD. Our Ultrascale Machine Learning Initiative, or “ULTRA” - will offer new AI and deep learning tools to discover features in massive scale genomics data - relating whole genome data to biomarker features by merging all relevant data sources. Our team of experienced PIs will coordinate efforts across the U.S. to create these large-scale data analytic tools. Our MPI team and 6 Core Leads have decades of experience working together and with the AD community in pioneering machine learning methods for AD genetics and neuroimaging, including leadership of international neuroimaging consortia across the world. Dedicated Cores focus on Genomic, Imaging, and Cognitive Data Harmonization. Curated data will then be efficiently imported into AI approaches and informatics pipelines that will allow the AD research community to leverage ultra-scale, multidimensional genomic and phenotypic data from the ADSP, NACC, ADNI, AMP-AD, and others. Our work is organized by a carefully-designed and coordinated Consortium guided by all stake-holders, clinical leaders, and pioneering analysts in AD genomics and neuroimaging. Our ultrascale AI tools will advance AD genomics research and will include efforts in training, and a dedicated Drug Repurposing Core. This team effort will accelerate understanding of the genetic, molecular and neurobiological mechanisms of AD, yielding significant translational impact on disease and drug development. NARRATIVE Our Ultrascale Machine Learning Initiative, or “ULTRA” - is a coordinated national initiative to develop transformative AI approaches for high throughput analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) and related AD biomarker and cognitive data. Biomarker data related to AD are being collected at “ultra-scale” and are likely to unlock numerous opportunities for AD treatment, yet the rapid collection of such data far exceed our current capacity to analyze it.

"Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Effectual solutions will come only from innovative research. While aging is the biggest risk factor for developing AD, it is unclear to what extent normal aging is distinct from AD and which age-related factors drive disease. Senescence is a homeostatic response, which aims to prevent the propagation of these damaged cells while they remain viable and metabolically active. Senescent-like phenotypes have been described in neurons despite neurons being post-mitotic cells and these cells may release factors that trigger senescence in surrounding glia. Senescent glia and senescent-like neurons increase in the brain with age and are thought to contribute to the loss of function associated with aging and age-related diseases like AD. Our application, entitled “Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,” is highly responsive to the objectives outlined in the RFA-AG-20-025, by leveraging an innovative molecular imaging platform we invented at Stanford; multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), in order to uncouple age- from cognitive decline-related cellular senescence. MIBI enables us to quantify, with low nanometer resolution, high-dimensional, protein-level expression patterns, single-cell (neuro/immune) interactions, and spatial localization of senescence- and AD- relevant molecules (Aim 1) in a model of healthy aging (Aim 2) and well-characterized cases of AD related cognitive impairment (Aim 3). Importantly, MIBI allows all of this to be accomplished in archival FFPE material, thus allowing retrospective analysis on a variety of existing cohorts. By creating in-depth, phenotypic cellular signatures with spatial context from our unique aging and cognitive cohorts, we will be able to provide insight for modifiable factors promoting cognitive decline by filtering those specifically associated with aging alone. In this research program, collaborative expertise in clinical neuropathology and cognitive decline, technological advancements in imaging, biochemical/molecular and cellular biology, and machine learning analytics converge in this proposed research program to address the spatio-cellular (neuro/immune, senescent) heterogeneity in non-human primate (NHP) and human models of healthy aging and AD brains. Furthermore, it will be synergistic to, and draw on expertise developed in existing infrastructure to image and organize AD clinical pathology (R01AG056287, R01AG057915, MPIs: SC Bendall, RM Angelo, TJ Montine) as well as the NIA-funded 90+ UCI cohort, control material housed in the Stanford ADRC, and NHP specimens (P50 AG047366 co-I: TJ Montine). We will reveal cellular senescent phenotypes that differentiate AD from normal age-associated senescence. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. By using multi- parametric measurements with enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) we will be able to uncouple unhealthy brain senescence, that could be therapeutically targeted, from that associated with the normal aging process.",Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,10222561,R01AG068279,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ',

"AMYLOIDOGENIC INDUCTION OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular senescence, one of the major hallmarks of aging, describes the sudden inability for cells to divide. Senescent cells often accumulate with age, in response to physical and chemical stressors (genomic instability, telomere attrition, irradiation, etc.), though the overlap between these stressors and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is currently unknown. In-vitro experiments of senescence often utilize contrived stressors such as hydrogen peroxide or radiation, that may not be physiologically relevant for age-related diseases such as AD. Furthermore, the senescence phenotypes observed in vitro are likely not complete models for what is occurring in dynamic biological systems.  Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Aβo), an important hallmark in AD, have been shown to potently induce senescence in a variety of brain cell types and environments, in contrast to fibrillar Ab. Aβo is thought to bind membrane proteins and subsequently signal downstream aggregation of related amyloids such as tau. In fact, the presence of endogenous Aβo is one of the strongest indicators of disease severity in AD models and organisms, suggesting a link between AD and cellular senescence that is only beginning to be explored.  In order to study this association, we propose to combine gold-standard techniques and single-cell omics data in order to define heterogenous genetic and epigenetic signatures of senescence that are distinctly a function of their induction type. Doing so will also produce robust signatures and biomarkers of senescence in brain cells that can be utilized for the pathological phenotyping of human tissues. These measures will also allow for the comparison of disparate senescent behaviors to help identify lab-derived amyloids that best resemble patient-derived constructs. We will evaluate multiple lab-derived Aβo constructs, including those stabilized from lipids located in predominantly diseased regions of the brain. Observations would be synergistically coupled with solution biophysics experiments and molecular modeling, providing analogous structural data for each inducer type. Taken together, these measurements will uniquely profile senescence in brain cells, define the degree of overlap between endogenous senescence inducers and those reconstituted in the lab, and highlighting how AD risk is modulated by cellular senescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE One of the most well-known hallmarks of human aging is cellular senescence; however the relationship between senescence and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is poorly understood. We hypothesize that soluble amyloids, but not fibrils or plaques, link the induction of cellular senescence in brain cells to neurodegeneration, yet it remains unclear which soluble amyloids modulate these behaviors. In order to test this hypothesis, we will utilize a combination of genetic and epigenetic measurements to compare the ability of synthetic and patient-derived amyloids to induce senescence in brain cells, thereby deducing the molecular and epigenetic overlap between senescence and AD.",AMYLOIDOGENIC INDUCTION OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE,10222562,R01AG068285,"['Affect ', ' Age

"Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer's Disease Genes and Risk Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer’s Disease Genes and Risk The molecular basis and genetic architecture of dementia remain a puzzle. As no drug yet prevents, delays, or reverses it, aging populations potentially face a tidal threat of incipient and socially disruptive Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked over 100 loci with AD and explain much of population attributable risk, but only a fraction of heritability. This heritability gap means it remains difficult to design and assess which surveillance, screening, preventive, and stratification programs are effective. In turn, this hinders therapeutic trials. The challenge in translating genetic variants into patient classifications is twofold. First, AD is polygenic, so relevant disease driving mutations are spread thin across a multitude of different genes and patients. Second, current interpretations of the deleterious effects of mutations lack accuracy, so the impactful few cannot be distinguished from the benign multitude in any given subject. These problems compound and fog the statistical genetics of AD risk and morbidity with poor signal to noise ratio. The crux of our solution is to add a massive amount of new information, exploit it efficiently through computation, then perform rigorous multi-pronged experimental validation. We start from the hypothesis that AD arises through mutational perturbations that affect functional pathways beyond the built-in evolutionary tolerances. New algorithms compute these excessive mutational forces and place them in integrative machine learning frameworks to sort between AD patients and controls, and which can also reflect functional interactions among proteins or genes. Innovations include a mathematical model of evolution based on calculus; ensemble machine learning over human genome variations; and harmonic analysis of mutational perturbations in functional networks. The outcome will, for the first time, integrate genomic variations relevant to AD in the context of all relevant evolutionary history and all known functional interactions. In practice, this will increase power and resolution, enable gender-specific analysis and AD stratification of men and women, and identify new and experimentally validated AD genes. To carry out this program, AIM 1 will fuse a novel mathematical analysis of evolution with machine learning and network wavelet theory. This will yield complementary integrative approaches to identify genes and mutations that sort AD vs healthy subjects based on the abnormal mutational burden of rare gene variants in sequenced cohorts. AIM 2 will focus similar tools on patients and controls with known paradoxical phenotypes that run counter to their APOEɛ2/4 status. The results will identify modifier genes that drive AD in APOEɛ2 carriers or that protect APOEɛ4 carriers from AD. AIM 3 will provide direct experimental validation, leveraging high-throughput, robot-assisted genetic modifier screening in Drosophila models of Tau or amyloid-beta peptide neurotoxicity. Promising targets will be further confirmed in mammalian neuronal cell culture. The work will validate a new approach to enlarge our understanding of genetic complexity in Alzheimer’s Disease for the identification of gene drivers and modifiers to guide clinical assessment of AD risk stratification. Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer’s Disease Genes and Risk Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is devastating and its social and economic impact is projected to rise dramatically. Here, in order to discover genes that underlie its mechanisms and clinical risk, we fuse a new mathematical and machine learning framework with experimental testing in diverse models. The outcome will integrate vast amounts of data from evolution, from genome sequencing from experiments and from patients to guide clinical assessment of risk and open new paths for understanding the disease and for drug development.",Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer's Disease Genes and Risk,10219658,U01AG068214,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ',

"Validation of a Virtual Reality Floor Maze Test to Detect Early Signs of Cognitive Impairment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Early diagnosis and identification of predictors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is crucial as it allows intervention with prevention and treatment strategies when neuronal loss is at its minimum. Spatial navigation is a complex and multi-component skill that gets impaired early in the course of brain diseases and may be considered a relevant, sensitive and specific marker for future clinical progress of AD, even in its preclinical stage. Active spatial navigation assessments allow to identify modifications of gait associated with cognitive decline, and to amplify the difficulty of the test through a dual task effect created by the increased postural demands of walking. This study will validate the first motor-cognitive screening instrument able to extract digital markers in the form of navigational and gait performances in people at risk of developing AD. We propose that a fully immersive Virtual Reality (VR) navigational test has numerous advantages with respect to classical tests because it allows the manipulation of environmental features based on specific needs. We will use a VR version of the Floor Maze Test (VR-FMT) to create virtual mazes with preferred complexity and display them within a commercial VR headset. Cognitively normal adults at low risk and higher risk of developing AD and subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment will complete two visits. In the first visit, a battery of neuropsychological tests will be taken. In the second, participants will perform multiple navigations inside the VR-FMT. Two visuals representations (vista and environmental), and two explorations types (real walking and with a joystick) will be tested. Gait will be recorded using VR trackers and a motion capture system. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be used to measure resting-state brain connectivity. In Aim 1 we will validate the gait measures and the manipulations operated by the VR-FMT. We hypothesize that the portable trackers will show comparable validity in measuring gait compared to the optical motion capture system and that participants will show different navigation performance in the walking and the in-place versions and in the environmental and vista spaces versions of the VR-FMT. In Aim 2 we will investigate the ability of the VR-FMT as a test to differentiate the various levels of cognitive impairment. We hypothesize that navigation performance while performing the active version of the VR-FMT in the environmental space would show superior ability to distinguish the groups. Then, a machine learning algorithm will be used to extract the most significant features and classify participants. We hypothesize that both gait and navigation performances would increase the sensitivity of the classifier. In Aim 3 we will explore associations between performance in the VR-FMT, neuropsychological tests, and brain connectivity. We hypothesize that lower navigation performance will be associated with altered brain connectivity and lower psychomotor speed, memory and executive function scores. Findings from this research will set the stage for further longitudinal studies which will be aimed at predicting accumulating AD biomarkers. The long-term goal is to develop an accurate, low-cost, user-friendly, and portable system that can be used to predict cognitive decline. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early diagnosis and identification of predictors for dementia is crucial as it allows for intervention with prevention and treatment strategies which can stop or delay progress. This 2-year project will develop and validate a real-space navigation test with a fully immersive virtual reality headset that detects signs of dementia by measuring navigation and gait abilities. The knowledge generated during this study will help scientists and engineers understand how navigational abilities change in older adults at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and could be useful to develop an affordable and accurate test to predict and detect cognitive decline using a portable virtual reality system.",Validation of a Virtual Reality Floor Maze Test to Detect Early Signs of

"Smartphone Pupillometer for At-Home Screening for Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease Project Summary/Abstract Dementia represents one of the most important public health concerns in the coming decades. Among the most important research goals will be to identify the earliest, most reliable and easily obtainable biomarkers of degeneration, because early identification of individuals most likely to decline now represents the most promising window for therapeutic interventions. The main objective of this project is to develop an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) screening solution based completely on a smartphone application that converts the phone’s facial recognition IR camera into a mobile pupillometer. Our scientific premise, demonstrated by our recent clinical findings, is that pupillary responses provide a biomarker of cognitive effort required to perform tasks before overt performance declines are manifest. Pupil size during cognitive tasks (e.g., digit span recall) increases in response to increased demands, is inversely related to cognitive ability (individuals with lower ability show greater dilation/compensatory effort), and pupil size decreases and performance declines when task demands exceed abilities and compensatory capacity. Someone requiring more effort to achieve the same score as another person is likely to be closer to maximum compensatory capacity and, therefore, at higher risk for decline. We have found that individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at greater risk for AD, show greater dilation (effort) on the digit span task, and that greater dilation is associated with greater polygenic risk for AD and neuroimaging indicators of locus coeruleus (LC) dysfunction. This is important because pupillary responses reflect LC functioning, and postmortem studies implicate the LC as an early site of AD pathogenesis and degenerative changes with disease progression. Thus, pupillary responses may serve as a specific biomarker of functional alterations in a brain system affected by the earliest manifestations of AD. Currently, pupillary responses can be measured in as little as 5 minutes using minimally invasive, but expensive and complicated office-based devices. To increase the scalability of pupillometry screening in AD, we propose to develop a smartphone assessment that older adults can administer themselves at home that tracks small changes in pupil dilation during cognitive tasks. We will further develop and evaluate different machine learning algorithms that use the pupillary response biomarker measured by the phone to perform automated risk assessment of severity of mild cognitive impairment at the early stages of AD. Because the project would be carried out in the context of a larger NIA-funded RF1 affiliated with the UC San Diego Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), it will be possible to validate mobile pupillometry assessments against gold-standard in-lab pupillometry in older adults with MCI, early AD, and healthy controls. Our translational goal is to provide access to low-cost at-home screening for people who are potentially at early stages of dementia. In addition, the creation of a low-cost and accurate pupillometer that can be immediately deployed through smartphones will open-up new opportunities for large scale cognition studies that require measurement of pupillary response frequently in daily life settings. Project Narrative Recent research has shown that pupillary responses, an index of how much cognitive effort is needed to perform a memory task, may provide a new biomarker of early risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD); people who have to try harder to perform the task may be closer to cognitive decline. This project aims to develop a self- administrable pupillometer for older adults that uses a smartphone’s built-in IR camera to record pupillary responses during a digit span memory task, with the goal of enabling a machine learning-based automated assessment of risk for cognitive decline. An automated phone-sensor based early stage AD screening tool has the power to enable broad screening of the population of older adults at low cost at-home, in low-resource clinics, and through community health services.",Smartphone Pupillometer for At-Home Screening for Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease,10214386,R21AG072534,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Services ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' locus ceruleus structure ', ' Locus Coeruleus ', ' Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis ', ' blue nucleus ', ' Memory ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Mydriasis ', ' Pupil Dilation ', ' Persons ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Public Health ', ' Pupil ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' Performance ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' Alzheimer screening ', ' high risk ', ' minimally invasive ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' response biomarker ', ' response markers ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,392099,CA-52
"Lens β-Amyloid Biomarker for Early Detection of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Study Recent research advances have led to detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and development of emerging disease-modifying therapies. Yet effective treatment remains elusive. Repeated failure of AD clinical trials has focused attention on preclinical AD that begins with clinically silent accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain and progresses to onset of cognitive symptoms. Early detection of preclinical AD is now recognized as a prerequisite for effective treatment. Aβ is an accepted “gold standard” AD biomarker. Available methods to assess Aβ burden rely on positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. These methods are expensive, invasive, cumbersome, not widely available, and difficult to scale. The NIA has identified development of new, safe, sensitive, cost-efficient, point-of-care technology to detect preclinical AD as a high-priority goal. This project addresses this unmet need by accelerating testing of an innovative drug-device combination eye scanner (Sapphire II) that detects AD-related Aβ in the lens. This novel approach is based on our discovery of AD-specific Aβ lens pathology in patients with pathologically-confirmed AD, but not other non-AD neurodegenerative diseases or normal aging. Moreover, we found that AD-related pathology and phenotypes are expressed far earlier in lens than brain in Framingham Eye Study participants. This and related research led to development of the Sapphire II system that combines a topically-applied Aβ-binding fluorescent ligand (Aftobetin) and a purpose-designed eye scanner with integrated fluorescent lifetime decay spectroscopy analyzer. The eye scanner and ligand reliably measure lens Aβ with high specificity, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise ratio. In Phase 2 clinical trials, the Sapphire II system showed high positive and negative predictive values for AD diagnosis and differentiated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinical AD from normal controls with greater sensitivity and specificity than amyloid-PET scans. This project leverages opportunistic timing of NHLBI-funded basic health exams by adding lens Aβ measurements in well- characterized, community-based longitudinal cohorts in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Specifically, we will evaluate lens Aβ burden in two older FHS cohorts (Aim 1; Gen 2, multi-ethnic OmniGen 1) and two middle-aged FHS cohorts (Aim 2; Gen 3, multi-ethnic OmniGen 2), each with longitudinal neuropsychological test battery results, concurrent MRI brains scans, and ancillary datasets relevant to cognitive decline and AD. Lens Aβ measurement will be evaluated using stratified analyses for age, sex, ApoE genotype, and AD risk factors (Aim 3) and computational modeling to construct multi-marker predictive profiles for AD (Aim 4). Results will be used to test our project hypothesis that lens Aβ burden will be elevated in middle-aged and older FHS participants who show evidence of cognitive decline (memory deficits, executive dysfunction), AD neuroimaging biomarkers, or clinical AD. Project results are expected to accelerate clinical introduction of lens Aβ burden as an objective measure to evaluate AD risk, detect preclinical AD, and assess early AD and progression in individual patients. This project will accelerate evaluation of an innovative drug-device combination eye scanner that specifically measures β-amyloid (Aβ) in the ocular lens for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We will test the project hypothesis that elevated Aβ burden in the lens is predictive of cognitive decline and early, pre- symptomatic (preclinical) AD in older and middle-aged longitudinal

"Fine-Grained Spatial Information Extraction For Radiology Reports ABSTRACT Automated medical image classification has seen enormous performance improvements recently, particularly in radiology. The application of these approaches to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), however, has been limited due to relatively small datasets and the limited granularity of their corresponding phenotypes. The dataset size issue is problematic as the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved such remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. Furthermore, the phenotype granularity issue impedes the targeted studying of AD along the lines of what is seen in the “precision medicine” approaches to diseases such as cancer. Solutions exist, however, as an increasingly accepted means of acquiring large amounts of labeled data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image If a radiology report describes a patient's AD-related finding, the associated image(s) can be used to train an image classifier. The parent project to this supplemental proposal (R21EB029575) proposes just such a NLP method while simultaneously solving the granularity issue by extracting fine-grained spatial information from the report. In the parent project, we are developing NLP resources and methods to improve the automated labeling of radiology images using the corresponding study reports. The parent is not specific to AD (or any disease), so this supplement will enable us to focus on this particularly important disease, which will benefit significantly from improved ML-based imaging. We will focus on MRI and PET scans. The Aims here parallel the parent project, each focusing on methods that specifically improve NLP for AD radiological indicator extraction as well as the validation of image classification from the corresponding labels. These Aims include (1) extending the spatial representation and corpus for Alzheimer's, (2) extending the NLP methods for automatic extraction, and (3) validating the AD-related labels for use in image classification. The long-term impact of this project is to substantially improve AD diagnosis by scaling up the amount of labeled data available to ML-based classifiers. The short-term goal supplement is to focus our NLP/Imaging combination research on the complex task of improving AD diagnosis. By extending our project with a specific target for AD, we will initiate a sizable research effort toward this goal. NARRATIVE This project proposes natural language processing methods for automatically extracting fine-grained spatial information—specifically related to Alzheimer's disease—from radiology reports. This will allow us to automatically annotate the image(s) associated with the report for scaling up the amount of training data available to enable state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods to better detect Alzheimer's.",Fine-Grained Spatial Information Extraction For Radiology Reports,10288320,R21EB029575,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dilatation - action ', ' Dilatation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Horns ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Medial ', ' Diffuse ', ' Training ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Performance ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Reporting ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' disease phenotype ', ' scale up ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' spatial relationship ', ' parent project ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,269607,TX-09
"A Novel Informatics System For Craniosynostosis Surgery Abstract  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in senile plaques and hyper-phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Since AD is a complex and multifactorial disease, large datasets with multiple data types have been critical to identify its risk factors. For several decades, only the allele 4 of Apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is present in about half of late-onset AD (LOAD) patients, has been convincingly demonstrated to affect risk for LOAD. However, unfortunately, current treatments are just palliative because they do not slow down or halt the disease progression. More research on biomarkers are urgently needed.  Data used in this study were obtained fromthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Currently ADNI consortium opened MRI imaging data for over 2,000 AD patients from normal, mild, moderate and severe stages. We plan to apply the AI and machine learning methods developed for craniosynostosis study in the parent R01DE027027 to the ADNI data and try to segment and reconstruct the AD imaging data, characterize the biomechanical property of brain in AD patients, and then further stratify the AD patients for better therapy. This kind of idea was never applied to AD research, which could be a potential contribution to the AD study.  Staging the AD disease is very important for design therapy strategy. There are numerous work studied imaging genetics from the ADNI data sets and biomarker based staging technologies, but none of those work studied the biomechanical property changes during the AD development. It has been observed by many researchers and physicians that AD tissues tend to be less stiff and less elastic. Hence, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the AD brain tissue property correlated to AD stages. Our immediate goal is to develop computational model to characterize the AD patient specific tissue elasticity and AD stages. To achieve these goals, our Specific Aims are: (1) to develop deep learning framework to obtain the brain volume and surface of AD patients; (2) to develop computational techniques for estimating sub-region tissue stiffness directly from AD imaging data; and to predict AD progression based on the biomechanical features of AD brain.  The scope of this NIA suppl. is within the scope of the parent R01DE027027 “eSuture system: A novel informatics system for craniosynostosis (CSO) surgery.” The eSuture system focuses on developing novel imaging informatics and machine leaning technologies to segment CSO imagining data, to stratify and classify CSO patients, and to characterize the biomechanical property of calvarial bone tissue with nonlinear finite element models. This project will be a substantial contribution to the public health by characterizing of the biomechanical property brain in AD patients, and then further stratify and stage the AD patients for better therapy.This project is expected to generate a new paradigm in AD tissue staging with machine learning approaches. It will advance our knowledge in biomechanical property and open up the possibility of novel treatments of AD in the future.",A Novel Informatics System For Craniosynostosis

"An AI-assisted screening platform within a multivariate framework for biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY Accumulating evidence indicates that every 65 seconds, someone develops Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the United States, and over 5.7 million Americans have the condition. Alzheimer's and other dementias will cost the nation $277 Billion by 2050. The major problem is that many people with cognitive impairment (CI) may not know they have it because dementia is underdiagnosed and underreported. There is a lack of low-cost and non- invasive screening instruments to identify individuals at risk for CI with high accuracy automatically. Therefore, considering the global and societal implications of the dementia epidemic, better strategies are needed to identify patients at risk for dementia. An eye health evaluation offers a unique perspective on the health of our eyes and our bodies. For example, visual observation of the retina as a diagnostic modality is already widely used to detect high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and even brain tumors since a physician can see the optic nerve, which is part of the brain. Thus, an eye test may also be a potential solution to detect CI. While early manifestations of numerous risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease) have been found in the human retina, they may confound the first signs of CI. In healthcare, the complexity and rise in data volume have contributed to the remarkable worldwide interest of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in medicine. Therefore, we aim to provide a practical near-term risk assessment of CI through AI, by identifying and utilizing novel multivariate biomarkers (including eye markers) with a better discrimination power. In this Phase I STTR, iScreen 2 Prevent, LLC, the University of Miami, and the iCareHub, LLC, will develop an AI-based screening platform for early detection of CI due to AD. Our preliminary data show that multivariate eye biomarkers are related to cognitive status and can be used to discriminate mild CI patients from cognitively healthy subjects (age-matched (55+ years old), area under the receiving operating curve (AUROC)=0.90 (SE=0.050), p<0.001). However, multivariate biomarkers need to be combined at the point of screening to enhance the accuracy of predictions, and biomarker methodologies could be advanced using AI. We aim to integrate and optimize our eye screening framework (iScreen 2 Predict™) into a digital health platform (iCAREHub) that collects personalized, comprehensive clinical data at the point of care. We also aim to develop an AI-based model with the integrated multivariate markers and test the iScreen 2 Predict™ software's ability to discriminate patients with mild CI due to AD. This project fills a critical technology gap in the field of AD diagnostics. While the number of screening tools using unimodal and expensive biomarkers continues to grow, these tools do not consider multivariate data generated during the routine care in a collective and automated way. Thus, their diagnostic potential is limited. The development of our software as a medical device (SaMD) for detecting CI due to AD earlier, considering multifactorial variables and relevant biomarkers of ocular-brain abnormalities related to cognitive status, will allow earlier intervention and facilitate better management of the disease's primary cognitive symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people. Unfortunately, current diagnostic technologies are limited because they predict cognitive impairment too late and cannot capture various risk or protective factors, increasing healthcare spending. In this project, we aim to develop iScreen 2 Predict™, an AI- based diagnostic platform for predicting persons at risk of AD in primary and community health care settings.",An AI-assisted screening

"Understanding the dynamic interactions between tau pathology and microgliamediated inflammation in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract The etiology, mechanism and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and the relationship of AD pathology to clinical manifestations, are not fully understood. Emerging studies suggest that inflammation and microglial activation is an important contributor to AD pathogenesis and progression. The association between tau and microglia is especially critical, since tau is most closely associated with AD. The conventionally accepted sequence of this interaction is that misfolded tau, which is pro-inflammatory, causes microglial activation, leading to dendritic pruning and eventually neuronal cell death. However, it is recently emerging that microglial activation can itself cause tau aggregation and subsequent propagation. Therefore the causality of these interactions is controversial, and requires much needed elucidation in humans in vivo. The goal of this proposal is to understand the interaction and causal sequencing between tau, neurodegeneration, microglia and systemic inflammation in governing the etiology and progression of human AD. This proposal involves a series of principled statistical and mathematical model-based tests that will uncover these relationships, for the first time, directly in patients. This proposal involves a new prospective longitudinal study of 100 AD spectrum patients acquiring brain MRI and PET imaging of activated microglia using a new generation TSPO ligand called DPA-713 and tau-PET imaging using a relatively novel ligand, MK6240. The same imaging protocol (MRI, DPA-713 and MK6240 PET) will be repeated at 18- and 36-month follow up time points. All subjects will have amyloid neuritic plaque density measured at baseline using florbetaben PET. Next this proposal involves developing and testing a model of microglial inflammation-tau interaction via mathematical models to determine whether regional microglia-mediated neuroinflammation measured by DPA-PET is higher in AD spectrum patients or in cognitively normal older adults; and whether regional microglial activation is predictable directly from tau and/or amyloid. Finally, this proposed research includes testing a network spread model of tau and microglia. Mounting animal data implicate a trans-neuronal transmission mechanism of tau through brain networks. Using a network diffusion model of disease spread, this proposal will further investigate the role of microglia in tau progression directly in humans. Since tau and microglia provide complementary signal about evolving pathology, this proposal will determine whether combining imaging studies that measure both biomarkers will result in a uniquely powerful and predictive test of AD progression. Given the rapidly evolving understanding of the role of microglia and systemic inflammation in dementias, the current proposal is timely, topical and necessary for advancing human dementia research. If successful, it will give the first validated spatiotemporal model of the causal interactions between pathology and neuroinflammation in AD, catalyzing future advances in prognostication and targeted anti-inflammatory therapies. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) poses an increasingly large public health burden. By providing new insights into the role of neuroinflammation in AD, this study will provide the foundation for future advances in prognostication and targeted anti-inflammatory therapies for this devastating disease.",Understanding the dynamic interactions between tau pathology and microgliamediated inflammation in Alzheimer's Disease,10317631,R01AG072753,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', '

"Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI Sensitive imaging biomarkers are urgently needed for screening of high‐risk subjects, determine early disease progression, and assess response to therapies in neurodegenerative disorders. The atrophy of several brain regions is an established biomarker in AD, which strongly correlates with AD neuropathology. The accuracy of subfield volumes and cortical thickness estimated from current MRI methods is limited because of the vulnerability to motion, low spatial resolution, low contrast between brain sub‐structures, and dependence of current segmentation frameworks on image quality. Short motion‐compensated MRI protocols to map the human brain at high spatial resolution with multiple contrasts, along with accurate and computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, are urgently needed tor early detection and management of subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. We propose to introduce a 15‐minute motion‐robust 3‐D acquisition and reconstruction scheme to recover whole‐brain MRI data with 0.2 mm isotropic resolution with several different inversion times on 7T, along with segmentation algorithms that are robust to acceleration. The key difference of this framework from current approaches, which rely on MRI data 1 mm resolution, is the quite significant increase in spatial resolution to 0.2 mm as well as the availability of multiple conteasts. This improvement is enabled by innovations in all areas of the data‐processing pipeline, including acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. These innovations are facilitated and integrated by the model based deep learning framework (MoDL); this framework facilitates the joint exploitation the available prior information, including motion and models for magnetization evolution, with convolutional neural network blocks that learn anatomical information from exemplar data. The successful completion of this framework will yield sensitive biomarkers, which will be considerably less expensive than PET and does not involve radiation exposure. As 7T clinical scanners become more common, this framework can emerge as a screening tool for high‐risk subjects (e.g. APOE, PSEN mutations) and assess progression in patients with short follow‐up duration. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is now a major public health concern with life expectancy at an all-time high. In US alone, the number of affected patients is expected to triple to 13.8 million by the year 2050. This proposal focuses on the development of an ultra-high resolution multicontrast MRI protocol, with the objective of improving the accuracy of brain atrophy rates in early AD subjects. The successful completion of this proposal will yield a biomarker that is sensitive to early brain changes in AD, which can facilitate early detection in high risk population, measure progression, and quantify the efficacy of brain sparing drugs.",Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI,10120861,R01AG067078,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', '

"Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning Project Summary Title: Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via ""neuropathometry"" of dissection photos with 3D scanning Summary: While most patients with late life dementia have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there are conditions that overlap or even mimic AD, confounding clinical diagnosis, and thus representing a barrier to accurate predictions of rate of progression and to effective therapeutics. Examples of these diseases include concomitant TDP-43 pathology, Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and microvascular lesions associated with poorly defined white matter lesions. A critical barrier to studying these diseases is that there currently is no reliable premortem biomarker. Here we propose a collaboration with two Alzheimer’s Research Centers to evaluate anatomical signatures of these three conditions, in contrast to AD, in order to enable research into them, and ultimately port back to MRI in order to directly enhance clinical care.  Specifically, we propose to use advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to perform volumetric photographic scanning post mortem (at autopsy), on patients seen at the Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center (MADRC). Reconstructing imaging volumes from dissection photographs, which are routinely acquired at brain banks and neuropathology departments, will enable us to correlate neuropathology with macroscopic measurements (e.g., volume and shape of brain structures, cortical thickness) without the need for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This is crucial because diagnostic MRI is not always acquired close to autopsy, or at all, and ex vivo MRI is expensive, technically challenging, and not available at many research sites. Therefore, our technique has the potential of greatly increasing sample sizes, especially with asymptomatic individuals who were not scanned in life, and who would likely manifest the earliest and purest neuropathological changes.  Our tools will combine ML with 3D shape scanning, which is an increasingly inexpensive technology ($1,000 - $10,000 for a scanner), to produce very accurate reconstructions of the brain shape. Moreover, we will also build an “atlas” version of the tool, that replaces 3D scanning by a probabilistic atlas, thus enabling analysis of retrospective data. We will develop the tools in collaboration with a second ADRC, the University of Washington ADRC, which has slice photographs for approximately one thousand cases.  The new tools will be used to closely study a prospective cohort at MADRC, consisting of 200 subjects. We seek to identify neuroimaging signatures of the AD mimics mentioned above, which can be ported to in vivo MRI scanning. Moreover, we will also distribute and maintain the tools as part of our neuroimaging package FreeSurfer (over 40,000 worldwide licenses), so they can be used by research sites around the world to augment neuropathology with macroscopic morphometric measures at little or no cost. Project Narrative There are conditions that overlap or even mimic Alzheimer’s disease, confounding clinical diagnosis, and thus representing a barrier to effective treatment. Here we propose a collaboration with two NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers to build advanced Artificial Intelligence tools that, combined with a 3D shape scanner, convert dissection photographs (routinely acquired by research centers) into 3D datasets. We will use these tools to unravel the connection between brain shape and microscopic diagnosis of AD mimics, and will also distribute them as part of our widespread software package FreeSurfer (over 40,000 worldwide licenses), so they can be freely used by research laboratories around the world.","Diagnosing the undiagnosable: studies of Alzheimer disease mimics and confounders via

"Alzheimer's Clinical Trial InnOvatioN (ACTION) Initiative Abstract The National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Research Implementation Milestones articulate the goals of the Institute for advancing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The Leadership Award for AD and Related Disorders requires that the applicant address objectives of the Milestones and provide mentorship to new and early stage investigators. The research proposed must be groundbreaking and paradigm changing. Among the eight focus areas within the Implementation Milestones' framework are Trial Innovation and Translation and Clinical Research – Pharmacological. The Alzheimer's Clinical Trial InnOvationN (ACTION) Initiative proposed here embraces both the research and mentoring aspects of the Leadership Award. The ACTION Initiative will include development of a Clinical Trials Observatory (CTO) and an embedded mentorship program. The CTO builds on the principal investigator's prior analyses of clinicaltrials.gov. This federal registry contains all trials conducted in the US and many trials conducted ex-US. It includes Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials of preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia trials. The PI has conducted and published research on the trial design, biomarker, and clinical outcomes data from the registry. In 2016, Congress passed a law requiring that trial outcomes be posted on the site within 1 year of completion of the trial. The PI proposes to build a multi-disciplinary team of engineers, computer scientists, statisticians, and bioinformatic experts to interrogate the range of data now available using artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning and deep learning. An external advisory committee will ensure quality and dissemination. The Alzheimer's Association will collaborate on results dissemination. An accessible web portal for the database will make reviewed data readily available for analyses and prediction/modeling of planned clinical trials. The growing database of real-world AD trial data will allow increasingly precise prediction of trial outcomes based on complex relationships among baseline features, trajectories of decline, drug mechanisms, and clinical and biomarker characteristics across all stages of AD. The data will be used by the PI, mentees, academic trial leaders, and industry trial sponsors. Three initial mentees are identified from neuropsychology, psychiatry, and engineering; more will be added with growth of the program. The ACTION Initiative has the potential to transform clinical trial planning and outcomes, leading to substantial impact on the Implementation Milestones of the NIA and accelerating development of new therapies for patients with AD and those at risk. Mentees will power the future of AD drug development and clinical trial planning. Project Narrative The ACTION Initiative will develop a Clinical Trial Observatory (CTO) with an embedded mentorship program to address the NIA Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Research Implementation Milestones.

"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents Abstract: Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the US and epidemiological data suggests they are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and have a higher occurrence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AD is defined neuropathologically by the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques. In addition to these hallmarks, many AD patients have mixed neuropathologies, including Lewy bodies (LBs) and pathological indices of CVD. Studies, involving mainly NHWs, have shown associations of these neuropathologies with clinical, genetic, and demographic variables providing insights into disease mechanisms and prevention strategies. However, there is a relative dearth of neuropathology studies on Hispanics. It is imperative to have neuropathology studies with individuals having diverse characteristics as this maximizes variability allowing for better identification of disease risk factors for more precision in development of preventative measures. This study will examine the neuropathologic landscape (the presence, location, and density of NFTs, plaques, CVD and LBs) of Hispanics compared to NHWs and determine if this landscape is altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables. To achieve efficiencies in time and further measurement precision we will enhance and adapt innovative machine learning algorithms to narrow in on pathology location and provide more quantitative analyses. Based on previous findings our central hypothesis is that Hispanics will have different neuropathologic landscapes when compared to NHWs and these differences are influenced by underlying risk factors, especially cardiovascular risk factors. Our specific aims are to: 1) profile the presence, location, and semi-quantitative densities of NFTs, plaques, LBs, and pathological indices of CVD in the setting of AD in Hispanics compared to NHWs, 2) profile and determine if pathologic measures from Aim 1 are altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables (APOE status, Hispanic origin, age at death, clinical history of cerebrovascular events (i.e. stroke), hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, sex, and/or education) and 3) strengthen and adapt a deep learning pipeline for quantifying AD pathologies. We will capitalize on existing well-characterized resources within three Alzheimer’s disease centers at University of California- Davis, the University of California- San Diego, and Columbia that contain a diverse autopsy confirmed AD Hispanic and NHW cohort. Also, we will use machine learning resources at the University of California San Francisco. This proposal will be the first largescale initiative to delineate the neuropathology in over 100 Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican origins compare to over 200 NHWs and determine the impact of comorbid risk factors. Profiling neuropathologic landscapes and understanding underlying factors has potential to shed light on mechanistic differences in disease development leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. Results will directly advance understanding of brain health (pathology) in an important and growing part of the elderly population that to date there is miniscule neuropathology information.

"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology. Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a drug-gene-disease multi-layered network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with neurodegenerative diseases through protein-chemical interactions, gene- disease associations, and chemical-disease associations through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach. New methods that can reuse old drugs to target mulple pathological processes in AD may provide new solutions to effective AD treatment.",Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural

"Advancing drug repositioning and development for Alzheimer's Disease using functional genomics and computational phenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder which is highly prevalent in the global population, affecting around 46 million individuals. Due to increased longevity, the prevalence is rising. AD is characterized pathophysiologically by extracellular β- amyloid deposition and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau. Current medications for AD provide some relief from disease symptoms but are not effective in all patients while severe side effects are observed. The disease is highly heritable and has a complex molecular basis, with a substantial polygenic component. There is an urgent need for developing approaches to target discovery and drug repurposing. The combination of methodological analytic advances, functional genomics data, and phenotype-rich datasets can be the foundation for identifying new therapies. Our central hypothesis is that an integrative approach spanning human phenomics and genomics will offer new AD therapeutic possibilities, including drug repositioning, and provide a powerful approach to drug target discovery. We will develop cutting-edge genetics-anchored computational methodologies for AD drug repurposing, generate a community resource to advance research in AD therapeutics development, leverage a collaboration (infrastructure and machine learning) with Google, and conduct target validation in a zebrafish model of AD. We have engaged an interdisciplinary team to ensure the success and broad impact of our proposal and lay the groundwork for future innovative research.

"Understanding the protective and neuroinflammatory role of human brain immune cells in Alzheimer Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that deeply impacts the quality of life both socially and financially for affected ones and their relatives. Despite extensive clinical and genomic studies, the exact mechanisms of development and progression of AD remain elusive. Microglia and other myeloid origin cells, collectively known as human brain immune cells (HBICs), have been identified to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of AD. This is supported through genetic association studies, where many of the common and rare risk loci affect genes that are preferentially or selectively expressed in HBICs, emphasizing the pivotal role of the innate immune system in AD. In the parent grant 1R01AG065582, we utilize fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate CD45+/CD11b+ HBICs from human brain fresh tissue. We then apply innovative neurogenomics and single-cell approaches to generate comprehensive, high-throughput, multi-omics molecular profiles of HBICs from 300 donors at different stages of AD. These remarkable resources can provide critical insights into the role of immune cells in AD by increasing our mechanistic understanding of dysfunction in AD risk loci. One critical component that is currently not addressed in the parent grant is to apply innovative genomic approaches using AI/ML techniques, which can harmonize the signals from different omics modalities and offer a novel insight into the role of microglia and other immune cells in AD. In this Supplement, to increase the utility of the data, we propose to develop and maintain a shared resource of high-dimensional HBIC omics data for AI/ML applications. In addition, we propose to build a multi-scale integrative deep learning model leveraging single-cell omics data, to demonstrate the utility of the resource and serve as a benchmark for others to provide a quantitative measure of performance. This model will help us to identify protective and neuroinflammatory HBIC subpopulations and colocalize transcriptomic and regulatory signatures at different stages of AD. The proposed work will address potential challenges in the development of AI/ML applications. We propose: (1) identifying and removing potential sources of technical variations and normalize the data (2) uniformly processing and preparing fully annotated AI/ML-ready resource in a self- contained form for rapid prototyping with modern AI/ML tools (3) sharing and collaborating ideas using an open forum using AD knowledge base portal. Successful completion of the proposed studies will: (1) facilitate access to large-scale, multidimensional datasets on HBICs for AI/ML applications; (2) accelerate researches for an increased mechanistic understanding of the onset and progression of AD; (3) provide systems-level insights about transcriptional regulation in HBICs and AD pathogenesis using integrative AI/ML model; (4) provide a prioritized list of significant loci and genes for future mechanistic studies in AD. Together with exemplary systems- level analyses and annotations of these datasets for AI/ML-based research, it will provide to the scientific community an urgently needed resource. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting 6.2M Americans, yet the exact disease mechanisms remain unknown. Human brain immune cells have been identified to play a critical role in the progression of AD, and therefore, extensive omics data have been generated to illuminate its role in AD. This application will transform multidimensional omics data generated from human brain immune cells, including single-cell molecular profiles, into AI/ML compatible shared data resources, accelerating the research about the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of immune cells on AD.",Understanding the protective and neuroinflammatory role of human brain immune cells in Alzheimer

"Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is marked by progressive neuropathological changes that begin decades before cognitive and functional symptoms, and thus efforts have been focused on developing innovative tools and biomarkers for early identification of pre-dementia stages. To date, clinical ability to identify those with pre-dementia stages of AD has been limited and requires expensive (amyloid PET) or invasive (lumbar puncture) testing. However, subtle changes in connected speech may be detectable years before overt disease symptoms present. Our team has developed an approach that uses machine learning and natural language processing combined with advanced acoustic phonetic and lexical-semantic analyses. Preliminary data show promise in identifying AD biomarker status and predicting 2-year cognitive progression. In the proposed study, we leverage our success in collecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, neuroimaging and detailed cognitive phenotyping combined with audio recordings of participants in the Brain Stress, Hypertension and Aging Research Program cohort. This cohort, now in its third year of follow-up, consists of 400 individuals 50 years or older with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. We plan to extend this cohort of 400 participants for 3 more years to collect additional waves of voice recordings, cognitive assessments, follow-up CSF biomarkers and neuroimaging. Our overarching hypothesis is that the derived novel features reflecting poor lexical- semantic connectedness or acoustic perturbations are significantly different between biomarker-positive and -negative participants, have better diagnostic performance with regards to the ATN framework than traditional cognitive tests and can track disease progression. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the accuracy of the derived digital biomarkers in detecting in-vivo AD pathology and ATN classification in the B- SHARP cohort; 2) Investigate the association of the derived digital biomarkers with disease progression and cognitive decline; and 3) Investigate the ability of repeated measurement of the digital biomarkers to track disease progression. This project will provide needed insight into the use of non-invasive digital biomarkers to improve the ability to detect and track longitudinal changes in cognitive and functional status in AD and will set the foundation for a future larger pivotal study. Recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning offer a unique opportunity to explore highly complex changes in connected speech in the preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the accuracy and diagnostic performance of non-invasive digital biomarkers in detecting and predicting AD biomarker status in individuals with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. It is anticipated that the findings of this project will improve the ability to detect and track longitudinal changes in the cognitive and functional status in AD.",Digital Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s

"TargetAD: A systems multi-omics approach to drug repositioning in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a slowly progressing, untreatable neurodegenerative disorder that affects a substantial fraction of the aging population today. Hundreds of clinical trials and massive investments into drug development efforts have so far not resulted in a single disease-modifying therapy that showed a significant beneficial effect on the disease. Drug repositioning, the application of approved drugs in a novel disease context, has gained increasing attention as a promising alternative to identify treatment options for AD. For successful pharmaceutical intervention in AD, a drug or drug combination needs to target the complex molecular changes observed in AD in a specific manner. To identify drugs exerting these desired effects a detailed understanding of the molecular networks across regulatory layers that underly the biological system is required. However, these networks are not readily available and are scattered across hundreds of studies and complex databases. To address this challenge, we propose TargetAD, a network-based framework that builds this molecular network from genetic associations, co-expression/correlation networks, metabolic pathways, gene regulation data, protein-protein interactions, and tissue-specific gene and protein expression data augmented with AD multi-omics associations, as well as drug-drug target data and molecular drug signatures. We will achieve this by leveraging the power of large-scale, multi-omics association results generated within NIH's large “Accelerating Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease” initiative and other large-scale population-based studies. The collective evidence will be stored in a publicly accessible graph database, which we then use for the identification of candidate drugs or drug combinations (“candidates”). Through the development of a novel network-based machine-learning method, we will rank candidates in the database by their probability to affect AD networks in a beneficial way. High-ranking candidates will be subjected to a comprehensive prioritization pipeline. To this end, we will retrospectively investigate whether longitudinal AD-related biomarker profiles of individuals who took a repositioning candidate show evidence for healthier aging in large studies of AD. These analyses will be complemented by examining whether the post- mortem neuropathological burden supports a beneficial effect of the candidate. To increase power and coverage of candidates, we will further analyze electronic health records from the UK Biobank for additional evidence. The three most promising candidates will be selected in discussion with a panel of experts. These will be evaluated by preclinical validation studies in animal models of AD. In summary, the unique combination of multidisciplinary expertise, access to high-profile datasets and advanced computational integration pipelines will allow us to identify molecular pathways disturbed in AD that are targetable by drug repositioning candidates, which thus are prime candidates for testing in clinical trials. Project Narrative Drug repositioning - the application of approved drugs in a novel disease context - has gained increasing attention as a way to identify alternative treatment strategies for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We here propose a novel machine-learning approach to identify drug repositioning candidates in a network-based framework by combining multi-omics associations from large studies of AD with molecular pathway information, extensive drug-drug target data, as well as molecular drug effect data. In silico repositioning candidates will be further prioritized through retrospective analyses in studies of AD and large-scale mining of electronic health records, and the resulting top three candidates will be experimentally validated in mouse models of AD.",TargetAD: A systems multi-omics approach to drug repositioning in Alzheimer's disease,10299231,R01AG069901,"['Affect ', ' Age ', '

"Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes With ageing populations world-wide, neurodegenerative diseases are placing an ever increasing  burden on long- term well-being, healthcare costs and family life. Despite decades of research and  enormous investment, no disease-modifying treatment is available for the most common of these  diseases: Alzheimer’s (AD). The majority of these, to-date unsuccessful, efforts have focused   on one potential cause of AD: amyloid-β aggregation. Combining population-scale data  collection, human genetics and machine learning provides a way forward to uncover and characterize  new causal cellular processes involved in AD. This would provide an array of potential therapeutic  targets, increasing the chance that one will be more easily modulated than the amyloid-β pathway.  AD-specific genomic datasets of unprecedented scale are being actively collected: whole genome  sequencing (WGS) from ~20k individuals, gene expression (RNA-seq) and epigenomics (ATAC-seq,  histone ChIP-seq) from >1000 post-mortem AD brains, single-cell transcriptomes and similar modalities in peripheral and  brain-resident innate immune cells (which we and others have shown to be AD-relevant). Effectively  integrating these diverse data to better understand AD represents a substantial computational  challenge, both in terms of data scale and analysis complexity. This proposal leverages  state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), combined with human genetic  analyses, to address this challenge. We will train DL models to predict epigenomic signals and  RNA splicing from genomic sequence, enabling in silico mutagenesis to estimate the  functional impact (a “delta score”) of any genetic variant. The delta scores will be used in  genetic analyses that distinguish causal associations: cellular changes that drive AD  pathogenesis rather than downstream/side effects of disease. Delta scores will aid in  associating both rare and common variants to AD. To achieve sufficient power, rare variants must be  aggregated (e.g. for a gene): delta scores will allow filtering out many likely non-functional  (particularly non-coding) variants. Most common variants from AD Genome Wide Association Studies  (GWAS) are simply correlated with the causal variant due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Delta  scores, combined with trans-ethnic GWAS, will enable estimation of the likely causal variant(s).  These analyses will highlight variants and genes involved in AD. However, genes do not operate in a  vacuum so robust probabilistic ML will be used to learn cell-type and disease-specific gene  regulatory networks from sorted bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. The detected networks will be  integrated with our genetic findings to discover network neighborhoods/pathways especially  enriched in AD variants. Such pathways will be prime candidates for future functional and  therapeutic studies of AD. The goal of this research is to use machine learning algorithms to work out which  genetic differences in the genomes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients might have  caused their disease. We will do this by learning computational models of how genes are  controlled by genetic sequence and other genes. The proposed study will discover what genes,  pathways and molecular mechanisms are involved in AD, which will provide novel  therapeutic targets for AD patients.",Learning the Regulatory Code of

"Development of perivascular space mapping toolset as a diagnostic aid for Alzheimer's disease Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating disease that affects millions of Americans and imposes a huge socio- economic burden. AD-related cognitive decline is associated with the accumulation of Aβ (Amyloid beta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which are insufficiently cleared and degraded by mechanisms such as the glia-lymphatic system or by transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Animal research has shown that the glia-lymphatic pathway plays a substantial role in the net clearance of Aβ. In addition, reduction of interstitial fluid efflux to the cerebrospinal fluid, or reduction of transport across the BBB, could lessen the Aβ clearance. Human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have also shown that the integrity of the perivascular space (PVS), the pathway of glia-lymphatic system, is a marker of glia-lymphatic brain health and its alteration is an important feature of AD pathology. PVS alteration in AD has been shown to be independent of Amyloid uptake, implicating astroglial involvement specific to AD. Information about PVS integrity could assist clinicians with making specific diagnosis about patients AD status and mechanism. Therefore, a tool that allows non-invasive in-vivo mapping of PVS from clinical MRI is of high significance to aid AD diagnosis and disease monitoring but does not yet exist. Current clinical routine to investigate PVS is a relatively crude approach based on counting total number of observed PVS in MRI by neuro-radiologists, which is non-specific, rater-dependent, and does not capture the distribution, whole extent of PVS change nor volumetric features of the PVS. From a practical point of view, this technique is time consuming and laborious. These limitations in part have prevented neurologists from adopting PVS quantification into their clinical routine. We have developed computational techniques for mapping and quantifying PVS morphology from MRI, which enables automated and accurate quantification of PVS across the brain without the need for time consuming manual intervention. These techniques were developed on research data, which had slightly higher resolution than clinical MRI. The goal of this proposal is to validate and optimize this technology on clinical MRI data, which can be variable in quality and resolution. We also aim to develop a scanner- and hardware-agnostic deployable analytical solution for automated PVS quantification, so that PVS mapping can be performed independent of the radiology/imaging IT infrastructure. If successful, we will have a fully developed and validated backend software that enables automated assessment of PVS and aids specific AD diagnosis and disease monitoring. Upon the completion of this goal, our Phase II will focus on translation of the technology via implementation and testing of the technology in collaboration with our strategic partners in clinic (Neuroradiology division of Keck School of Medicine), industry (BioGen Inc.) and research (MarkVCID and NASA). Our ultimate goal will be to integrate PVS measures into clinical diagnosis, disease monitoring and intervention efficacy assessment, as a specific non-invasive and in-vivo imaging marker of AD pathology that can be automatically and reliably measured. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because identifying pathological alterations to the brain perivascular spaces is expected to aid in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and disease monitoring. Traditionally, assessment of perivascular spaces in clinic was limited to visual counting on MRI, which is time consuming and inaccurate. The aim of this proposal is to develop and optimize reliable automated techniques to map perivascular spaces in clinical setting.",Development of perivascular space mapping toolset as a diagnostic aid

"Uncovering the Heterogeneity of Neurodegeneration Trajectories in Alzheimer's Disease Using a Network Guided Reaction-Diffusion Model Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. Due to the multiplicity of clinical symptoms, standard neuropsychological assessments inadequately reflect the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, which renders a significant gap between neurobiological examinations of AD pathology and clinical diagnoses. Mounting evidence shows that AD is caused by the build-up of two abnormal proteins, beta-amyloid and tau. Over time, these AD-related neuropathological burdens begin to spread throughout the brain, which results in the characteristic progression of symptoms in AD. Although striking efforts have been made to investigate the neurobiological factors behind the acquisition of amyloid (A), protein tau (T), and neurodegeneration [N] biomarkers, a system-level understanding of how these neuropathological burdens promote neurodegeneration and why AD exhibits characteristic progression is still largely elusive. In this study, we will combine the power of systems biology and network neuroscience to disentangle the heterogeneous trajectories of cognitive decline in AD population by understanding the dynamic interaction and diffusion process of AT[N] biomarkers from an unprecedented amount of longitudinal neuroimaging data. The backbone of this project is our recently developed network guided reaction-diffusion model that characterizes not only the interaction of AT[N] biomarkers at each brain region but also their propagation pattern across the brain networks using PDEs (partial differential equations). Given its promising results in predicting the evolution of AT[N] biomarkers, we will further develop our current PDE-based model by incorporating spatiotemporal-adaptive mechanistic pathways of AT[N] biomarkers. Then, we will investigate the system behaviors that steer the trajectory of cognitive decline in Aim 1. After that, we will develop a novel deep learning approach to stratify aging brains into a set of fine-grained categories (aka. subtypes) with distinct neurobiological underpinnings, where individuals within the same subtype are expected to have very similar trajectories of cognitive decline. We will evaluate the novel population stratification result using the longitudinal imaging data from the ADNI database in Aim 2. The success of this project will allow us to have a new understanding of the neurodegeneration process in the cognitive continuum spectrum. This is an important step because slowing down this spread at an early stage might prevent or halt the symptoms of AD. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to disentangle the heterogeneity of neurodegeneration trajectory in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by understanding the mechanisms of how neuropathological events spread throughout the brain. To that end, we will first refine our network guided reaction-diffusion model to characterize the complex and evolving mechanistic pathways of AT[N] biomarkers and study the resulting system behaviors that govern the trajectory of cognitive decline in Aim 1. Second, we will develop a novel machine learning approach to stratify the aging brains based on the system behaviors and investigate the neuroscientific and clinical underpinnings of the identified subtypes in Aim 2.",Uncovering the Heterogeneity of Neurodegeneration Trajectories in Alzheimer's Disease Using a Network Guided Reaction-Diffusion Model,10288783,R03AG073927,"['DWI (diffusion

"Use of machine learning to quantify cognitive function in AD, FTD, and DLB Project Abstract / Summary Cognitive assessment is a key element of the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having early symptomatic stages of neurodegenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), and Lewy Body Disease (LBD). As biomarkers mature, the field is separating clinical syndromes arising from these diseases from the neuropathologic changes themselves, leading to concerns about classification systems for the illnesses these diseases produce. Many tests typically employed in cognitive assessment are verbal, often implemented by an examiner asking the patient a question and the patient answering. These tests are typically scored by hand, with the examiner counting correct or incorrect answers and a simple score being generated against normative scores. Many of the tests still in use were developed 30+ years ago. An exciting array of recent advances in artificial intelligence methods has begun to enable the measurement and classification of language and other cognitive characteristics captured in audio recordings. Here we introduce a new approach to accomplishing both of these possibilities. Recent developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) have now made possible the automated discovery and classification of features measurable in speech samples. Once established, these feature sets can be connected to distributions of cortical atrophy, thus enabling links between specific cognitive abnormalities and underlying neural networks. This approach to the analysis of clinical dementia syndromes can be achieved through a sufficiently large number of cognitive test measures recorded as speech samples. In addition, such analyses require the use of the latest generation of artificial intelligence models, called transformer-networks, to be able to learn the unique ways in which individuals with cognitive impairment or dementia respond to questions requiring memory, executive function, emotion, or language. In Aim 1, we will investigate the validity of an unsupervised artificial intelligence model for measuring cognitive abnormalities in patients with AD, FTLD, or DLB against traditional clinical measures and against MRI measures of regional brain atrophy. In Aim 2, we will investigate the performance of an unsupervised artificial intelligence model for classifying cognitive abnormalities in AD, FTLD, and DLB patients into clusters. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the reliability of these automated measures of cognitive abnormalities in AD, FTLD, and DLB. Through a finer-grained analysis of cognition in people with AD, FTLD, or DLB, it should be possible to develop better understanding of the overlapping and dissociable features of these dementias, aiming for improved diagnostic classification and better monitoring.

"Neurobehavioral phenotyping of AD model mice using Motion Sequencing Abstract  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by progressive changes in neural circuits that culminate in memory loss, confusion, difficulty completing tasks, withdrawal, mood changes and ultimately death. Alterations in body movement — such as slowed gait, and difficulty in avoiding obstacles — have been associated with AD, are predictive of AD, and often appear in the pre-clinical stage, before cognitive changes are apparent. These observations raise important questions about how AD targets the cognitive and motor systems that support movement and/or action selection; addressing these questions in turn requires a clear view of how AD pathophysiology influences behavior both early and late in disease, and particularly how these changes in behavior are distinguished from the many motor-related changes apparent during normal aging. However, to date behavioral analysis of movement in AD mouse models have not yet yielded a clear and consistent view of how AD affects the neural circuits responsible for selecting, composing, sequencing and implementing ongoing behaviors. At least in part this failure reflects the methods used to characterize behavior in mouse models, which depend upon a set of reductionist assays that capture limited aspects of a mouse's overall behavioral comportment within a given experiment; as a consequence we do not know whether different AD models share core movement phenotypes, nor do we understand whether or how AD targets the cortico-striatal circuits that create the coherent, moment-to-moment patterns of action used by mice to interact with the world. Our laboratory has recently developed a novel behavioral characterization technique, based upon 3D machine vision and unsupervised machine learning techniques, called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq). MoSeq automatically and without human supervision identifies the behavioral modules (“syllables” e.g., a left turn, the first half of a rear, etc.) out of which spontaneous and self-directed behavior is composed, as well as the statistical rules governing the sequencing of these syllables (“grammar”). We have previously demonstrated that the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) contains explicit neural correlates for both syllables and grammar, and that the DLS is causally required to assemble syllables into meaningful and adaptive sequences. Here we propose to use MoSeq to characterize behavioral phenotypes expressed by a variety of AD mouse models, to perform joint neural-behavioral recordings to probe circuit mechanisms that underlie these observed phenotypes and, finally, to develop MoSeq into a broadly-applicable platform for studying the movement-related signatures of cognition. Taken together, these experiments promise to revitalize the study of behavior and neuro-behavioral relationships in pre-clinical models of AD, and to reveal key mechanisms that tie together AD-related genetic lesions, neural circuit function, and ongoing naturalistic patterns of action. Narrative In Alzheimer's disease (AD), changes in movement often presage cognitive decline; in these proposed experiments, we will characterize behavioral changes in mouse models of AD using advanced machine learning techniques, and ask how AD-related pathophysiological lesions might lead to altered neural codes and therefore changes in movement.",Neurobehavioral phenotyping of AD model mice using Motion Sequencing,10281230,RF1AG073625,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cognition ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Financial cost ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gait ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' tangle ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' object recognition ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Mouse Strains ', ' Mutate ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' disease phenotype ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' loss of function ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' AD model ', ' alzheimer model ', ' normal aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' cognitive performance ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' neural correlate ', ' movement analysis ', ' Self-Direction ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine vision ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2021,1931938,MA-07
"Improving the sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease Finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one the greatest scientiﬁc challenges of our time. There is a growing realization that experimental treatments should target the earliest, presymptomatic stages of disease. But the cost of conducting clinical trials in participants who may not develop symptoms of AD for years can be prohibitive. There is a growing need for more eﬀective biomarkers of AD, particularly biomarkers of therapeutic eﬃcacy that can detect slowing or reversal of AD-related changes due to treatment as early in the clinical trial as possible. These biomarkers must be as sensitive as possible to disease progression and also account for AD heterogeneity, i.e., the fact that the majority of individuals who have AD pathology also have one or more concomitant pathologies that may aﬀect their ability to respond to experimental treatments for AD. This proposal focuses on deriving eﬀective presymptomatic and early symptomatic AD biomarkers from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the imaging modality that provides the most direct evidence of neuritic and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disease. Rather than propose new MRI acquisition protocols, we focus on the most commonly collected type of MRI scan in AD research (T1-weighted 3D gradient echo scans with approximately 1x1x1mm3 resolution) and use advanced computational analysis to quantify changes in the subregions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), the brain region that associated with early stages of AD pathology as well as with early stages of multiple concomitant non-AD pathologies. Aim 1 will develop and validate advanced algorithms that combine conventional multi-atlas segmentation with deep learning to reliably extract small subregions of the MTL, such as Brodmann area 35, explicitly accounting for anatomical variability in the MTL. Aim 2 will correlate quantitative digital pathology measures derived at autopsy with antemortem MRI to discover distinct patterns of change that we hypothesize are associated with concomitant pathologies in AD, including TDP-43 pathology, alpha-synucleinopathy, non-AD tauopathies, and cerebrovascular disease. Aim 3 will apply deep learning to improve the sensitivity of measures of change in longitudinal MRI, hypothetically leading to a more sensitive early marker of treatment eﬀectiveness in trials targeting preclinical AD than existing cognitive and imaging-based measures. Taken together, improved precision of segmentation (Aim 1), determination of spatial patterns of AD and concomitant non-AD pathology (Aim 2), and advanced longitudinal measurement methodology (Aim 3) will optimize MTL subregional sensitivity and speciﬁcity for the earliest neurodegenerative changes of AD, providing a potentially critical therapeutic eﬃcacy measure to accelerate clinical trials of disease modifying treatments in early AD. Treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely be most eﬀective if applied before patients begin to develop symptoms of cognitive decline. But clinical trials in individuals who do not yet have any symptoms of disease can take a very long time and be very costly. This project uses common magnetic resonance imaging exams and artiﬁcial intelligence tools to detect subtle changes over time in parts of the brain where damage speciﬁcally due to Alzheimer's disease ﬁrst occurs, providing clinical trials with a faster way to determine if treatments are being eﬀective.",Improving the sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based biomarkers in Alzheimer's

"Alzheimer's MultiOme Data Repurposing: Artificial Intelligence, Network Medicine, and Therapeutics Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture; furthermore, there are no disease modifying treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process for AD. Traditional reductionist paradigms overlook the inherent complexity of AD and have often led to treatments that are lack of clinical benefits or fraught with adverse effects. Existing multi-omics data resources, including genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, interactomics (protein-protein interactions and chromatin interactions), have not yet been fully utilized and integrated to explore the pathobiology and drug discovery for AD. Understanding AD genetics and genomics from the point-of-view of how cellular systems and molecular interactome perturbations underlie the disease (termed disease module) is the essence of network medicine. Systematic identification and characterization of novel underlying pathogenesis and disease module, will serve as a foundation for identifying and validating novel risk genes and drug targets in AD. Given our preliminary results, we posit that a genome- wide, multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) framework to identify new risk genes and networks from human genome/exome sequencing and multi-omics findings enable a more complete mechanistic understanding of AD pathogenesis and the rapid development of targeted therapeutic intervention for AD with great success. Aim 1 will determine whether rare coding and non-coding variants by whole-genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES) are enriched in protein-functional and gene-regulatory regions using sequence and structure-based deep learning models. These analyses will assemble WGS/WES and clinical data from Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), publicly available protein structure (i.e., protein-protein interfaces, protein-ligand binding sites, post-translational modifications) and sequence (expression quantitative trait locus [eQTLs], histone-QTLs, and transcription factor binding-QTLs) information from the PDB database, GTEx, NIH RoadMap, FANTOM5, PsychENCODE, and NIH 4D Nucleome. Aim 2 will determine whether GWAS common variants linked to AD pathobiology and endophenotypes are enriched in gene regulatory networks in a cell-type specific manner using a Bayesian framework. We will validate risk gene and network findings using WGS/WES and protein panel expression data from our existing cohorts: The Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Biobank (CBH-Biobank) and the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (CADRC). Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that risk genes and networks can be modulated via in silico drug repurposing, population-based validation, and functional test, to identify candidate agents and drug combinations that will modify AD. The successful completion of this project will offer capable and intelligent computer-based toolboxes that enable searching, sharing, visualizing, querying, and analyzing genetics, genomics, and multi-omics profiling data for genome-informed therapeutic discoveries for AD and other neurodegenerative disease if broadly applied. Project Narrative It is estimated that more than 16 million people with AD live in the United States by 2050 and the predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. This proposal will develop intelligent computer-based network medicine and systems biology tools, capable of identifying and validating human genome sequencing findings for novel risk gene discoveries and targeted therapeutic development in AD. The innovative network-based, artificial intelligence toolboxes and novel risk genes and biologically relevant targeted therapeutic approaches developed in this proposal will prove to be novel and effective ways to improve outcomes in long-term brain care for the rapidly growing AD population, an essential goal of AD precision medicine.","Alzheimer's MultiOme Data Repurposing: Artificial

"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's

"Gene Profile Analysis of Associations between Alzheimer’s Disease and Circadian Rhythmic Patterns of Human Brain Regions Using Machine Learning Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia, and it has an increasing death rate throughout the world. It gradually damages a patient’s memory, speech, thinking, and ability to perform routine activities. While a few drugs may temporarily relieve some mild early AD symptoms, they cannot stop or reverse cognitive and memory impairment. Multiple studies have shown that circadian rhythm and AD have a close, intricate, bidirectional relationship. Accumulating evidence indicates that the disorder of circadian rhythm is not only a pathological marker but a putative risk factor of AD. Improved understanding of the relationship between AD and the circadian rhythm has the potential to guide the development of effective AD interventions or treatment. Timed gene expression data human brains are rare because of its highly invasive nature. In general, brain gene expression studies in neurodegeneration are based on post-mortem tissue samples with no or inaccurate, if any, time labels. Currently, there is a pending need for characterizing molecular mechanisms which underlie the relationship of AD with human brain circadian rhythms. However, effective methods are yet to be developed to analyze whole-genome gene expression data with none or inaccurate time labels to discover AD-specific differentiated circadian rhythmic patterns. Toward filling this urgent unmet need, our overall aim is to develop innovative algorithms to discover circadian oscillation patterns based on genome-wide gene profile analysis, and leverage them to identify and understand the associations of AD with circadian rhythms of different brain regions. This project will bridge a critical methodological gap to enable innovative discovery from untimed high- dimensional human brain data. It has a great potential to advance the understanding of the impact of circadian rhythm on AD, and also provide researchers with a host of potential therapeutic targets for AD, e.g., rhythmic synchronization of brain regions, to guide the development of future interventions. This project is highly innovative. For the first time, gene profile analysis based on untimed expression data of tens of thousands of genes will be performed to pinpoint the AD-specific differentiated rhythmic patterns of different brain regions. To our knowledge, this is the only capacity of its kind, which permits the most direct glimpse into the circadian events in the human brain at the brain region- or tissue-level. The algorithms will be used to find oscillation patterns and rhythmic correlations between brain regions for cohorts with or without AD and unique subsets of AD patients. Because a clear understanding between AD and the disturbances of human brain circadian rhythms is elusive, deciphering oscillation patterns of brain regions and accounting for patient heterogeneity should advance our understanding of the complexity of AD and its intricate relationship with circadian rhythms of regions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 study is a retrospective study, and we will conduct genome-wide analyses of secondary untimed gene expression data in existing large-scale databases of randomized cohorts for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The goal is to discover circadian oscillation patterns and using them to pinpoint associations of AD with circadian rhythms of human brain regions to guide future development of interventions.",Gene Profile Analysis of Associations between Alzheimer’s Disease and Circadian Rhythmic Patterns of Human Brain Regions Using Machine Learning,10126568,R21AG070909,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alpha Rhythm ', ' α Rhythm ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Speech ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' large-scale database ', ' large-scale data base ', ' usability ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' therapeutic target ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' secondary analysis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' circadian ', ' Circadian Rhythm Disorder ', "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' gene expression database ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R21,2021,420750,KY-06
"Exploring Common Biological Pathways Underlying Insulin Resistance and Alzheimer Disease using Genetic and Omic Tools Project Summary / Abstract Insulin resistance (IR) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but the mechanisms by which IR predisposes to AD is unknown, notably, if IR is causally related to AD and which regulatory mechanisms underlie IR and contribute to AD. The proposal is designed to address these critical gaps in scientific knowledge by using omics to evaluate the causal relationship of IR on AD and to reveal new regulatory mechanisms involved in IR and AD. The Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Sarnowski, is a statistical geneticist and an early career investigator with a research focus on the identification of genetic and environmental risk factors of complex traits. The long-term goal of this project is to identify individuals who will benefit from treatments improving insulin sensitivity to better prevent, delay or stop the progression of AD. The overall objective is to better characterize mechanisms by which IR contributes to AD and evaluate how they may differ from known mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis. The central hypothesis is that omics will help to better understand and characterize the relationships between IR and AD. The rationale is that omics will help to disentangle the mode of action of IR on AD and identify targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions. Guided by strong preliminary results in the Framingham Heart Study, the hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: 1) Determine if IR is causally related to AD in a Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework with various genetic instrument variables (IVs); 2) Characterize molecular signatures of IR associated with AD using brain and blood omic data; and 3) Develop a joint test to evaluate the genetic contribution at IR signatures associated with AD. In Aim 1, genetic IVs, including standard and pathway-specific genetic risk scores and predictors identified by machine learning, will be constructed to evaluate the causal relationships between IR and AD using various MR methods. In Aim 2, association analyses will be performed to identify brain and blood omic signatures of IR related to AD. In Aim 3, new integrative statistical methods leveraging annotations will be developed to evaluate the genetic contribution on omics at loci involved in IR and AD. Career development activities will include training in AD pathophysiology, multi-omic analysis and machine learning techniques through coursework, seminars, mentorship, and collaborations with a team of leading expert scientists. The approach is innovative by shifting focus to omics to study the regulatory mechanisms involved in IR and AD. The proposed research is significant as the expected outcomes will contribute to a better understanding of how insulin sensitivity can be improved to better prevent, delay or stop the progression of AD, reduce cognitive decline and prevalence of dementia due to AD, and promote brain health in late life. The experience acquired in achieving the aims of this grant will advance the PI’s career to an independent statistical geneticist with bioinformatics expertise, to dissect how vascular risk factors interact with genomics to influence AD and dementia susceptibility using large-scale omics. Project Narrative This research project aims to better characterize the biological mechanisms involved in insulin resistance and their role in Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed research is relevant to public health as it is expected to provide new ways to prevent, delay or treat Alzheimer’s disease, by targeting insulin sensitivity. Thus, the project is relevant to the part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to improving fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of complex human diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.",Exploring Common Biological Pathways Underlying Insulin Resistance and Alzheimer Disease using Genetic and Omic Tools,10126565,K99AG066849,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood -

In order to achieve fast and accurate prognosis of AD dementia based on neuroimaging data, we will develop and validate novel deep learning techniques. Particularly, we will develop unsupervised deep learning methods for segmenting brain images and reconstructing cortical surfaces from structural magnetic resonance imaging data. These fast and accurate image processing methods will be used in conjunction with advanced deep learning methods to build prognosis models of AD dementia and cognitive decline in a time-to-event analysis framework using large-scale imaging datasets. Finally, we will develop and disseminate a user friendly, open source, modular, and extensible software package to improve prognosis of AD dementia. Source code, standalone programs, and web-application interfaces of all the algorithms will be made available on GitHub and NITRC. Our tools will enable real-time neuroimaging data analysis and can find applications in diverse fields, including quantifying brain changes associated with aging and development.

"Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 8 individuals over 65 years old in the US. Within AD, approximately 40-60% individuals are affected by psychotic symptoms (AD+P), which are associated with more rapid cognitive decline, greater disability, mortality and caregiver burden, resulting in a disproportionately large disease burden. Recent studies indicate a genetic basis for AD+P risk, but the molecular basis of AD+P remains largely uncharacterized, hindering the search for appropriate treatments and novel therapeutics. In this proposal, we seek to systematically dissect the mechanistic basis of AD+P by systematic generation, integration, and experimental dissection of transcriptional and epigenomic phenotypes across two brain regions and four cell types. (1) We profile single-cell RNA-seq and cell-type specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq across 192 post-mortem brain samples, each in two regions across AD patients with psychosis, AD patients with no psychosis, schizophrenia patients with no AD, and control individuals. (2) We integrate the resulting datasets with genetic information and GWAS data to predict driver genes, regions, variants, and pathways underlying AD+P using state-of-the-art machine learning methods for causality, mediation analysis, and genetic Bayesian fine- mapping. (3) We use our computational predictions to guide a systematic dissection of the molecular underpinnings of AD+P using a modular and programmable CRISPR-Cas9 methodology in iPSC lines to modulate regulatory elements, genes and alleles, and measure the resulting molecular and cellular phenotypes in cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes. If successful, this ambitious proposal has the potential to provide the first mechanistic insights on the development of psychotic symptoms in AD+P and/or P-AD, reveal functional risk variants and target genes for therapeutic intervention that will likely influence clinical management in order to alleviate the personal and societal burden associated with these disorders.

"Microglia models for Alzheimer's disease drug screening PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disease marked by a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions, resulting in profound dementia. AD is the most common late-onset dementia affecting millions of people in the developed countries of the world and the AD population predicted to reach 130 million by 2050. There has been a concerted effort to identify the mechanism of disease, development of models and therapeutics. In AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, the observations of uncontrolled chronic inflammatory pathology in the CNS and genetic associations of immune pathways have implicated the microglia. The microglia are the key immune cells in the CNS which provide immunesurveillance, secrete inflammatory molecules, and clear cell debris from the extracellular space. In AD, there is an uncoupling of microglial activation and phagocytosis functions suggesting that these cells are targets for AD drug discovery. Recently, human iPS-derived microglia (iMGLs) models have started to become available. Therefore, the overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize an in vitro high throughput, high content functional suite of AD iMGLs assays with the Phenovista’s proprietary culture screening system. These assays will allow for a next-generation in vitro system for ranking the relative efficacy of AD microglial based therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is among the disorders that represents an underserved area for drug discovery and development. As a result, the successful development of a low-cost, high-performance technology for predicting the efficacy of drugs on human microglia, an important immune cell type in the brain, would help improve the development process for new AD therapies. Therefore, the goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize an in vitro high throughput human microglial assay suite using Phenovista’s proprietary culture

"Biomarker discovery of Alzheimer's disease trajectory using NMR platform ABSTRACT  In response to the NOT-GM-21-028, we are submitting a supplement to our parent R01 5R01GM120033-05 to fund a summer undergraduate student from Rice University who has been accepted to Baylor College of Medicine Summer Undergraduate Research Training (SMART) program.  Within our R01 award, we are developing two powerful new automated algorithms to capture biomarkers of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Both of these tools capitalize on recent developments in machine learning; one of them, NMRQuant, has already been validated on simulated and phantom nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data and is ready to be applied to biological samples. We propose to examine the plasma samples obtained from the Texas Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC), which prospectively collects demographic, environmental, neuropsychosocial, and genetic data along with the biofluid samples, in consecutive 1-year follow-up analyses that track various health outcomes. The undergraduate student will spend 10 weeks in the lab as part of SMART program and will examine 30 AD plasma samples for biomarkers of disease using NMR and our new algorithms. Baylor College of Medicine approved in-lab training of SMART students. Thus, within the lab, the student will learn necessary procedures when dealing with human samples, new technologies such as NMR, and computational analyses. Through the SMART program, the student will expand her academic knowledge and career planning via structured daily seminars. She will also present her progress and data to the lab and to the SMART program. This work will thus bring transformative knowledge to her future career of a physician/scientist. NARRATIVE This application seeks to funding for a summer undergraduate student to expand her technical, academic, and career planning knowledge through in-lab bench work, computational training, and structured SMART program career training at Baylor College of Medicine. Building on our new NMR tools developed through our parent R01 award, the undergraduate student will examine plasma, obtained from a cohort of prospectively followed healthy individuals and those with AD through the Texas Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC), for NMR-based metabolomics biomarkers, to shed new light on the AD sub-phenotypes toward discovery of precision biomarkers of the disease.",Biomarker discovery of Alzheimer's disease trajectory using NMR platform,10394015,R01GM120033,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Award ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Structure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate research ', ' laboratory experience ', ' lab experience ', ' lab training ', ' laboratory training ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,10805,TX-09
"LifeBio-ALZ: AI driven digital biomarker engine leveraging natural conversation to widely scale accessibility for early detection and assessment of Alzheimers disease progression Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia to occur in elderly populations, affecting over 30 million individuals worldwide. As the U.S. elderly population continues to increase, AD incidence rises as well, as there is no neuroprotective therapy or cure. Common symptoms include memory loss, cognitive impairment, disorientation, and psychiatric issues. Traditionally, diagnosis is achieved through a combination of clinical criteria such as neurological examination, mental status tests & brain imaging. However, these strategies are challenging for detection of early AD or patients with mild symptoms, specifically during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. Mental status tests & subjective journals, kept by patients or caregivers, can track AD progression, but have low sensitivity and reliability. The most strongly established biomarkers for AD, including amyloid beta, tau protein, & phosphorylated tau, are all obtained thru CSF requiring invasive lumbar puncture.  The LifeBio-ALZ technology will provide a convenient and accessible, yet comprehensive digital biomarker and analytics suite to detect & assess Alzheimer’s progression. The platform will integrate a suite of assessment domains all seamlessly captured through a single, patient-centric app that engages users in natural video chat conversation via smart digital assistant. During brief, but regular sessions, an individual answers questions following a smart sequence to evaluate awareness, engagement, cognition, reaction time, speech patterns, & emotional state. The platform will record audio/video during the conversation. Type and timing of assessments, as well as specific questions will be adaptively modulated based on AD stage, personal demographics and previous analytics to minimize user burden while still providing rich data for algorithms. Quantitative features across multiple domains will be extracted from digital speech and eye movements, and then used as inputs to an AI engine to detect and assess Alzheimer’s’ disease progression. Data will be aggregated in secure cloud storage with clinician access to dashboard visualization tools.  Phase I will demonstrate core feasibility. Development will build on a strong tech foundation of an existing LifeBio platform to increase likelihood of success. Currently, LifeBio is deployed in several formats including web, phone, & mobile apps to record life histories of people reaching advanced age or facing life-threatening illnesses or memory loss. Natural language processing tools parse information into life stories shared by family or used by staff to personalize engagement in care facilities. While the existing tech provides a base, significant enhancements will be executed in Phase I. More specifically, Phase I tasks will first update platform architecture to integrate novel data domains, build on smart sequenced multidimensional questions, and enhance patient workflow interfaces. Once the enhanced app passes all technical verification testing, it will be deployed in a field data collection and usability study with wide ranging AD patient demographics and stages. Finally, collected data will be used to build and validate an AI engine for detection and assessment of Alzheimer’s progression. The Phase I objective is to design, develop and demonstrate feasibility of LifeBio-ALZ, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven, digital biomarker engine leveraging natural conversation to widely scale accessibility for early detection and assessment of Alzheimer’s disease progression. Current biomarkers for early prediction of Alzheimer’s include cerebral spinal fluid, circulatory biomarkers, blood based amyloid markers, inflammatory markers, & oxidative stress; which are expensive, time-consuming, & invasive. Therefore, a low-cost, patient- centered, & scalable tool with suite of digital biomarkers processed from natural conversation would have a significant impact on healthcare outcomes and

"Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the complexity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis and the associated co-morbid conditions, both the “depth” and the “width” of currently available drug repurposing solutions need to be improved in order to deliver effective AD therapeutic solutions. The depth of a drug-repurposing project refers to the level of understanding of disease mechanism and drug-target interactions across a wide searching space for the combination of dosage and treatment time. Achieving depth requires a reliable AD model system that comprehensively recapitulates AD pathogenesis in a human brain-like environment, and sophisticated transcriptomic profiles, which can reveal molecular-level changes underlying disease-reversing phenotypes across multiple treatment conditions. The width of a therapy search relies on the efficacy of predicting and validating effects of candidate compounds from an enormous search space. Width can be achieved from novel computational algorithms connecting –omics changes with phenotypic changes, thus guiding the search with improved knowledge on mechanisms and avoiding exhaustive testing of every available drug. Integrating the systems medicine and drug repositioning expertise of the Wong Lab at the Houston Methodist Research Institute of Houston Methodist Hospital with the Alzheimer's biology expertise of the Kim and Tanzi labs at Massachusetts General Hospital, we propose a SysteMatic Alzheimer's disease drug ReposiTioning (SMART) framework based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening. Reformatting a novel three- dimensional human neural stem cell culture model of AD (a.k.a. Alzheimer's in a dish) developed in the Kim and Tanzi labs for high content screening, the Wong lab screened 2,640 known drugs and bioactive compounds and obtained a panel of 38 primary hits that strongly inhibit β-amyloid-driven p-tau accumulation. We hypothesize that iteratively running relatively small screens with our novel 3D cell model and applying systematic artificial intelligence modeling to the transcriptomic profiles of the screening hits will allow us to: 1) quickly obtain a panel of robust novel drug candidates for AD, and 2) gain an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms from those repositioned drug candidates, which will subsequently improve the success rate of predicting novel hits. Using the primary 38 hits as a starting point, the SMART computational modules will update the existing NeuriteIQ software package to quantify the image data from high content screening; it will also incorporate publicly available big data transcriptomic profiles to predict candidate compounds inducing similar pathway changes as those original compounds, effectively expanding the search width to tens of thousands of compounds while only requiring functional validation of less than 100 drug candidates. The validated predictions will, in turn, add to the panel of known hits that will launch the next round of computational predictions and experimental validations, efficiently generating candidates for novel AD therapies (Aim 1). SMART's iterative prediction-validation scheme effectively connects more transcriptomic profiles to desirable phenotypic changes. Thus, we will apply systematic image-omics modeling to uncover novel mechanisms driving such phenotypes. For all the validated hits, dose-responses for the phenotype of pTau inhibition will be obtained using the 3D culture model; while the dose-responses for individual genes and pathways will be modeled through public and in-house generated transcriptomic profiles. We will use Partial Least Square Regression models to identify gene modules with matching dose-response curves as the phenotypes, thus allowing us to go beyond the confinement of canonical pathway maps and identify novel functional modules specifically related to phenotypes of interest (Aim 2). Selected compounds derived from the previous two aims will be evaluated in human neurons directly derived from AD patients and in animal models (Aim 3). Success of this work will lead to new AD therapeutic compounds ready for translation into clinical trials, as well as a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the SMART framework for drug repositioning will be generalizable to other big data and disease platforms. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) currently afflicts 5.3 million people in the United States alone. Beyond symptomatic treatments, no clear therapeutic options are available. The proposed study provides a systematic drug repositioning strategy that uses a novel 3D human neural culture model (Alzheimer's-in-a-dish) integrated with a computational platform that leverages publicly available toxicology and pharmokinetic big data. Success of the study will greatly reduce the cost of AD drug development, identify potential new disease mechanism, and facilitate quicker translation from bench to bedside. .",Systematic Alzheimer's

"Small Molecule Modulation of S1PR Signaling for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. A disease- modifying therapeutic does not yet exist for AD and currently represents a significant, unmet medical need. Tiaki Therapeutics has discovered a signature of neuroinflammatory disease biology that is present in several neurodegenerative disorders, including a neuroinflammatory subpopulation of AD patients. Neuroinflammation plays a substantial role in the development and progression of AD and is increasingly recognized as a third disease pathology. Dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism and signaling is a significant contributor to the shared neuroinflammatory disease biology. Tiaki has created an ex vivo systems biology assay that models the same neuroinflammatory disease biology seen in patients for use in both target validation and as a functional assay to support drug discovery. Eight targets were assessed and only antagonism of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor consistently and robustly reversed the disease-associated neuroinflammatory signature. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the CNS, subserve a critical role in maintaining homeostasis in under normal conditions. However, under extreme circumstances microglia can be induced to enter a toxic, pro-inflammatory state. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid created through the action of sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) and signals through a family of GPCRs (S1PR1-5). Exposure of microglia to pro- inflammatory stimuli results in an increase in activity of SPHKs, production and release of S1P and subsequent activation of S1PRs, which ultimately drives NF-κB-mediated transcription and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This feedback loop establishes a self-sustaining cycle of local microglial activation that can mediate propagation of pro-inflammatory signaling. We hypothesize that alleviation of this pro-inflammatory feedback loop will restore a CNS environment where microglial protective functions are favored, thereby decreasing neurotoxicity and promoting neuronal homeostasis. The S1PR of interest is expressed on microglia and the expression of this gene is dysregulated in AD patient transcriptomes. Tiaki’s lead small molecule reverses the neuroinflammatory signature in the ex vivo slice culture assay and in vivo in a bespoke animal model that recapitulates the neuroinflammatory changes observed in patient transcriptomic data. Using a homology model and targeted analogs, we have established a robust structure-activity-relationship for modulation of the specific S1PR. Tiaki proposes further optimization and development of this lead molecule to enable clinical studies investigating the potential for specific modulation of microglial S1PRs in treating AD. To this end, we propse to: 1) Optimize the bioactivity and physicochemical properties of our lead compounds, 2) Confirm anti- inflammatory activities of lead compounds in neuroinflammation assays, and 3) obtain toxicological and safety profiles of the microglial S1PR modulators. At the end of this project, Tiaki will have a clinical candidate compound and an IND supporting future clinical studies for the modulation of neuroinflammatory AD. Narrative Neuroinflammation is a key aspect of disease biology in Alzheimer’s disease. We discovered a new way to reduce neuroinflammation by interfering with a novel signaling pathway in microglia, the immune cell of the brain.

"Development of a cost-effective and neurobiologically valid VR assessment tool for   early detection of AD PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with significant impact on patients, families and the public health system. At the time of clinical manifestation of dementia, significant irreversible brain damage is already present, rendering the development of cost-effective, biologically informed assessment tools for early detection of the disease an urgent prerequisite for potential therapies to delay or prevent symptoms. While significant advances have been made in characterizing early stages of AD for research, current standard-of-care measures used for clinical diagnosis of prodromal AD lack the ability to identify AD in early stages. The overarching goals of the proposed study are to integrate VR, advanced neuroimaging technologies, and computational techniques to refine, optimize, test and validate a VR-based assessment tool that is cost-effective and ecologically and neurobiologically valid for early detection of AD. Particularly, we will integrate performance on a VR-based multidomain cognitive assessment battery combined with real-time performance data across multiple sources (e.g. kinematic) to identify subtle factors underlying VR task performance that contribute the most to sensitive detection of prodromal AD. Most importantly, using advanced quantitative MR measures of brain microstructure, we will test the association between VR measures and early markers of microstructural changes in brain networks to identify the most biologically valid VR measures of prodromal AD. Our central hypothesis is that VR measures of episodic memory, spatial navigation, and visuospatial skills are most sensitive in detecting prodromal AD, and that these VR measures predict AD- related brain pathology in medial temporal and posterior parietal cortical regions as well as in cingulum and hippocampal white matter fascicles. Our preliminary data using an in-house, novel, multidomain VR assessment battery on a sample of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and older healthy controls (HC) (N = 23, 17 with aMCI) supported our hypothesis. We propose to refine, optimize, test and validate our suite of VR measures in a larger sample (N = 50 total, 30 aMCI) to accomplish the following Specific Aims: To optimize and test a suite of VR assessments for sensitive detection of prodromal AD (Aim 1) and to test the biological validity of the proposed VR measures in detecting prodromal AD pathology (Aim 2). Successful validation of the proposed VR battery may lead to development of a cost-effective, ecologically and biologically valid assessment tool for early detection of AD. Further, these measures can potentially be used as sensitive behavioral markers for monitoring the response to experimental AD treatments and predicting cognitive and clinical trajectories. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant microstructural changes occur in the brain years before clinical manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), rendering the urgent need for cost-effective, neurobiologically informed assessments for early AD diagnosis.

"Towards Robust Multiplex Genome Engineering Beyond CRISPR-Cas9 Supplement Application Abstract Towards Robust Multiplex Genome Engineering Beyond CRISPR-Cas9 Recent genome-wide association studies on Alzheimer’s Diseases (AD) and related dementias have provided a rich resource of AD risk genes and variants. While this bounty of information is poised to transform neurodegeneration research, we need tools to identify and validate their functions. Genome engineering tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 are valuable for such validation, allowing precise editing of AD-related genomic variants. However, current genetic engineering approaches are limited in efficiency, scalability, and have unwanted editing errors that could confound validation experiments. Moreover, we need tools with robust activities in challenging neuroscience models, beyond editing a few cell lines. Hence, building on our existing NHGRI-funded work, we will use innovative genome technologies for studying AD and related dementias, in collaboration with experts at the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Firstly, we will use computational simulation with experimentation to develop precision tools to edit human risk variants in AD models. We will leverage and further develop our novel CRISPR enzymes and RNA-to-DNA editing tools that we recently established based on work from the parent award (JACS. 2019). Secondly, we are developing error- free gene-editors via mining metagenomic recombination enzymes. These error-free gene-editors are capable of engineering up to multi-kilobase sequences in human stem cells and neurons (Wang et al., under review). We will use this accurate gene-editing methods to engineer large AD risk alleles in neurodegeneration models, and, working with expert collaborators, demonstrate in vivo editing. Thirdly, we are developing Turbo-seq, a single-cell perturb-seq platform leveraging machine-learning algorithms and our multi-target CRISPR screen tool for AD studies (Hughes et al., submitted). We will apply Turbo-seq to simultaneously engineer single and multiple AD-associated variants in relevant disease models, with an initial focus on APOE alleles and related protective (or causal) variants. We will determine the functional consequences when genetically engineering these AD variants compared with healthy controls, integrating single-cell profiling of RNAs and proteins. Our multi-target, scalable CRISPR tools will significantly accelerate functional study of neurodegeneration variants when considering the large number of candidates, existing and from our collaborators’ work with the Stanford Extreme Phenotypes in AD (StEP AD) cohort, and help identify potential interactions between risk alleles. Overall, our plan is to build a gene-editing and single-cell toolkit, with an accompanying data- analysis pipeline for neurodegeneration research, thereby expanding the parent award’s tool-building and resource-sharing efforts into this new focus with the supplement. Project Narrative Towards Multiplex Precision Genome Engineering Technology Beyond CRISPR As medicine advances to unravel mechanisms of complex human diseases such as neuro- degeneration, a remaining challenge is that our knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic basis of these disorders are often limited to small genome changes like single-nucleotide variants. The key bottleneck for uncover these genome black boxes is the lack the precision tools to study large genome changes. Thus, it demands new modalities of multiplexable and accurate genome engineering tools that we proposes to develop here, leveraging advances in computational modeling and genome editing, to push our ability to engineer, track, and control cellular genome, with Alzheimer’s Disease model as initial test ground.",Towards Robust Multiplex Genome Engineering Beyond

"Assessing Alzheimer disease risk and heterogeneity using multimodal machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by progressive loss of cognitive function. Unfortunately, currently there is no effective treatment for AD and clinical interventions of AD have largely failed despite enormous efforts. For the current application, we seek to develop multimodal machine learning models by leveraging the rich collection of AD-related omics data and phenotypical data recently generated from large-scale collaborative projects such as Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Three aims will be pursued in the current application. Aim 1. We will build an expandable multimodal unsupervised machine learning framework to investigate AD heterogeneity. Given the multifactorial nature of AD, we will perform AD subtyping by harnessing the rich information across multiple spectrum of data. Aim 2. We will build an expandable multimodal supervised machine learning framework to quantify AD risk from longitudinal follow up of cognitively normal elders. The models will be built from genetic susceptibility and gene regulatory information as well as endophenotypes measured when participants were cognitive normal. Aim 3. We will build AD-related gene interaction networks in post-mortem human brain samples. We will examine the association of multiple omics data with AD in brain samples, and build tissue-specific interaction networks to understand potential molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. The present application represents an innovative approach to identify individuals at high risk of AD from both clinical and genetic risk factors in ethnically diverse populations. The outlined strategy will provide new insights into the risk stratification and prevention strategies for AD. We also commit to share our methods through GitHub or CRAN for free access across the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but therapeutic clinical trials for AD have largely failed. The objective of our proposal is to develop and apply multimodal machine learning methods that can identify patterns and/or clusters with similar characteristics using extremely large amounts of data such as have been generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and other large-scale collaborative projects. We will apply these methodsto investigate AD heterogeneity and identify people with high AD risk before symptoms are observed, which might provide new avenues for better diagnosis and treatment of AD.",Assessing Alzheimer disease risk and heterogeneity using multimodal machine learning approaches,10296695,U01AG068221,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', '

"Drug Discovery for Alzheimer’s Disease Enabled by Multi-Omics and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how amyloid beta oligomers (AβO) induce neurotoxicity and neuron death in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as evidenced by a dearth of therapies to prevent or halt AD progression. Continued existence of this knowledge gap represents a major issue for public health and the mission of the NIH because, until it is filled, development of treatments for neurodegeneration in AD will remain largely intractable. The long-term goal of this work is to discover pathways that enable resistance to AβO- induced neurotoxicity thereby allowing discovery of new AD therapeutics. The overall objective here, which is the next step in pursuit of this goal, is to build AI that accurately predicts the ability of drug candidates to cure or prevent toxicity of AβO in human stem cell-derived cortical glutamatergic neurons. To train this AI, a library of proteomic and metabolomic (hereafter referred to as multi-omic) phenotypes will be generated from neurons that are: 1) healthy, 2) AβO-treated (AD-like), or 3) drug library+AβO-treated. The central hypothesis is that some drugs at least partially palliate AβO-induced neurotoxicity, which is observable as a shift in multi-omic state toward the healthy state, and that AI can learn to predict this curative potential from drug structures. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data generated by the applicant and literature. The rationale for the proposed research is that mapping the difference in multi-omic phenotypes of healthy and AβO-stressed neurons, and mapping how chemical structures induce changes between those states, will allow AI to learn to make accurate predictions of whether additional, unmeasured molecules can improve neuron health. This will result in new and innovative approaches for prevention and treatment of AD. Guided by preliminary data and literature, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) validate the multi-omic phenotype landscape of healthy and AD-like neurons; and 2) build AI to discover new drugs that prevent AβO-induced neuron death in AD. The first aim will validate the human disease relevance of our model system using cell- based assays and by comparing omic profiles from our system to those observed in human AD brains. The second aim will build a map of how drugs candidates alter neural multi-omic states to use for training predictive AI. Completion of these aims will contribute (1) an in vitro system that mimics physiological milieu, and also (2) molecular ‘omics’ signatures of those healthy and AD-like human iPSC-derived neural cells, which are two areas of high program relevance defined in NOT-AG-19-007. This approach is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it departs from the status quo by using highly translatable human iPSC-derived neurons for unbiased discovery of palliative drug candidates using a unique combination of multi-omics and AI. This contribution will be significant because it is expected to vertically advance our understanding of basic neuron stress resistance, as well as result in the first drugs that prevent AβO neural toxicity. Ultimately, such knowledge will be useful for other neurodegenerative disorders of aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of new neural resilience mechanisms is ultimately expected to result in new therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease. This project also produces molecular omics profiles from human iPSC-derived neurons, which will serve as a resource for Alzheimer’s disease researchers. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIA’s mission to support biological research on aging and develop research resources.",Drug Discovery for Alzheimer’s Disease Enabled by Multi-Omics and

"SCAN: Standardized Centralized Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Neuroimaging PROJECT SUMMARY Amyloid PET is central to a biological definition of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and has been integrated heavily into the research setting since the first PIB-PET scans in 2004. The SCAN-Amyloid Legacy (SCAN-AL) Project will leverage already established research programs (SCAN, NACC, LONI) along with extensive work that has been conducted over the previous 15 years at the ADRC site level to implement and collect expensive and valuable amyloid PET data on ADRC research participants. The ultimate goal of this effort is to curate and harmonize pre-existing amyloid PET data collected across ADRC sites to create a large-scale resource that can be disseminated to the ADRC community for use in various research endeavors. More specifically, during this award period we will aim to curate 3000 amyloid PET scans, which is similar to the number of amyloid PET scans currently available through ADNI, and to link this data to extensive data already available on these participants (clinical and cognitive data, biofluid data, postmortem data, etc). Whereas the parent SCAN award focuses on processing of prospective PET and MRI data utilizing rigorous standardization methods both during image acquisition and post-acquisition processing, SCAN-AL will allow more flexibility to enable the specific goal of obtaining legacy amyloid PET data on as many unique ADRC Clinical Core participants as possible. This work is significant because we are quickly approaching 2025 and still lack a disease modifying treatment for AD. The data leveraging proposed herein extends the value of the considerable funding has been directed towards cohort studies of AD to contribute towards this goal of curing AD by 2025. Increasing the utilization of pre-existing amyloid PET dataset across ADRCs is particularly significant and unique compared to other large-scale efforts such as ADNI, given the heterogeneity in ADRC participants both in terms of clinical diagnoses and demographics. Whereas ADNI focuses specifically on normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD diagnoses, the ADRC program recruits participants spanning a range of neurodegenerative diseases that reflect the focus and expertise of local investigators, such as vascular disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, Parkinson’s, etc. Further, the ADRC program is unique in that a broad range of demographics regarding race, ethnicity, and age are reflected. We anticipate that the SCAN-AL Project will contribute to timely scientific opportunities related to the validation of plasma AD biomarkers, support innovative analyses that require large datasets such as work with genetics and machine learning, as well as enable the investigation of rare phenotypes that are difficult to collect at one site alone. This effort will provide ample opportunities to AD investigators and complement the efforts of the SCAN initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE (no changes from original submission) The field of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research has entered the era of “big data”, where large, multicenter data sets have contributed greatly to our understanding of the clinical variability, epidemiology, and genetics of the disease. This project will create an infrastructure for obtaining standardized brain images that can be combined across the 30 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers to create a very large database. Because imaging has become an integral part of the assessment of patients with AD, this work will advance our capabilities for performing high quality research on virtually any topic in this field

"Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium Abstract In response to PAR-20-099 “Harmonization of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (AD/RD) Genetic, Epidemiologic, and Clinical Data to Enhance Therapeutic Target Discovery”, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team that includes experts in neuroimaging, neuropsychology, fluid biomarkers, neuropathology, and vascular contributions to ADRD to work in close partnership with the NIH and the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Our ADSP Phenotype Harmonization Consortium, or “ADSP-PHC”, seeks to work in coordination with existing ADSP workgroups and initiatives to (1) streamline access to endophenotype data, (2) provide high quality endophenotype harmonization across multiple research domains, and (3) provide comprehensive documentation of both data availability and harmonization procedures. This project includes two coordinating centers, three cores, and eight domain- specific harmonization teams led by world-renowned experts in their fields. While our efforts will focus on data access, documentation, and harmonization, we will work closely with other ADSP workgroups and other large-scale harmonization efforts to maximize the impact and align with NIH priorities. In particular, we will focus harmonization on ADRD-related endophenotypes, including cognitive scores derived from detailed neuropsychological assessments, measures of neuropathology measured both ex vivo (neuropathological assessment at autopsy) and in vivo (fluid biomarkers and positron emission tomography biomarkers), concomitant pathways of injury (vascular risk factors and vascular brain injury), and measures of neurodegeneration focusing on both white (diffusion-weighted MRI) and grey matter (T1-weighted MRI). The proposed harmonization effort will provide an unprecedented opportunity to disentangle the genetic architecture of individual biological contributors to ADRD risk and progression. The harmonized data, protocols, and educational tools developed by the ADSP-PHC will transform the ADRD landscape, accelerate discovery, and facilitate the application of emerging big data analytic approaches leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence. NARRATIVE The growing availability of endophenotypic data in cohort studies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) provides an exciting opportunity to further characterize the genetic architecture of this devastating disease. However, there is a pressing need to develop and apply advanced harmonization approaches to align AD-related endophenotypes across cohorts. The goal of this coordinated national initiative – the AD Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium, or “ADSP-PHC” - is to provide a centralized database of robust endophenotypes for large-scale genomic analyses that will accelerate the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in AD.",Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization

"GaitIQ: Establishing a Digital Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Early detection of pre-clinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) during the long latent period prior to manifest dementia offers significant opportunities to advance the development of disease modifying interventions and effectively slow the disease’s progression. To achieve this objective, there is a critical need for new technologies that accelerate the development of biomarkers with high sensitivity for underlying AD pathology. A highly promising biomarker for preclinical AD is gait, as subtle gait changes have been correlated with elevated amyloid burden and cortical atrophy. While even simple measures of gait speed predict incident dementia in older adults, current research indicates that preclinical AD pathology is more precisely captured by a combination of 3D kinematic and spatio-temporal measures. A cost-effective mobile application that can be used in clinical trials and by healthcare personnel to capture these parameters efficiently, combined with a validated system to translate the measures to quantifiable AD risk in minutes, would result in a paradigm shift in availability of AD screening for at-risk individuals. GaitIQ™ is an innovative digital health startup company developing an online software-based product that employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to compute clinically accurate spatio-temporal and 3D kinematic data, from a simple video of a person walking. GaitIQTM collaborates with The Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio and Southwest Research Institute for this SBIR project. The expected outcome is that advanced kinematic/spatio-temporal measures of gait captured by the GaitIQTM system will reveal a sensitive and specific gait signature with high diagnostic accuracy for pre-clinical AD in a sample of Hispanic older adults. The project will develop and validate the capacity of GaitIQ™ to detect a digital gait biomarker signature that distinguishes between individuals with preclinical AD and controls. The final digital platform will be an easy-to-use, powerful tool to identify and monitor patients with pre-clinical AD using just an iPad/tablet to video their gait and submit it for analysis in the cloud by GaitIQTM sophisticated, proprietary analysis software. Changes in a patient’s walking gait can reveal important early signs of AD decades before cognitive symptoms are observed. GaitIQ™ is a San Antonio-based startup company focused on developing an early-stage digital health software technology that leverages novel machine vision, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics. Our technology can detect subtle gait changes strongly correlated to increased risk for AD using just an iPad or tablet camera in the clinic.",GaitIQ: Establishing a Digital Biomarker of Preclinical

"Reconstructing the temporal landscape of gene regulation in aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The circadian rhythm orchestrates a vast repertoire of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes with a 24-hour period. A clock circuit, driven by the oscillatory activation and repression of a set of core clock genes, is present in every cell and regulates the expression of nearly half the genome across all tissues. Abundant epi- demiological evidence links circadian regulation to human health. In particular, sleep and circadian disruption is associated with neurodegeneration, where it is thought to be both a consequence and a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the most common form of dementia in the elderly, AD is rapidly becoming a public health cri- sis, affecting an estimated 5.5M people in the United States (24M world-wide) and is expected to double over the next 20 years. Addressing this crisis requires a deep understanding of disease mechanisms and the identiﬁcation of diagnostic/therapeutic targets. A wealth of existing transcriptomic data, coupled with the development of sophisticated computational tools for temporal reconstruction and analysis, provide an exciting opportunity to identify dysregulation in oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and AD.  We propose to develop novel computational strategies to decipher the oscillatory patterns of gene expression using existing untimed transcriptomic datasets; and to apply them to existing data from studies of AD to identify dysregulation in the oscillatory patterns associated with AD. Our methods address a number of analytical chal- lenges, including the need to reconstruct temporal information from untimed samples; ensuring generalizability and accuracy across different transcriptomic proﬁling technologies; addressing the fact that untimed samples may not span the full day; and identifying changes in complex, non-sinusoidal rhythms. Together, these studies will reveal oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and Alzheimers disease, and will provide innovative new methods for the circadian analysis of untimed data that can be applied to other phenotypes. NARRATIVE The circadian rhythm orchestrates critical physiological functions at the molecular, cell, and organismal levels. While degradation of the circadian rhythm is known to be associated with aging and believed to contribute to Alzheimer's and other age-related diseases, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly characterized.

"Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Project Summary – IADRC Overall The Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (IADRC) was established in 1991 to bring investigators and institutional resources at the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) together to address the fundamental causes and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Despite many important gains, the need for targeted research is greater than ever, with an estimated 5.8 million people in the U.S. suffering from AD/ADRD. Unfortunately, we do not yet know how to prevent AD or have an approved disease modifying intervention. Both are critical to stem the growth in dementia prevalence. The overarching goal of the IADRC going forward is to support the goal of the NAPA to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025, through innovative research on etiology, early detection, and therapeutics. Biomarker studies indicate that processes leading to AD begin at least 20 years prior to dementia, suggesting that successful interventions must be implemented early. This presents a potential opportunity for early intervention, but the field is challenged by critical barriers decreasing the prospects of timely success. The IADRC has identified the barriers as: a) The current understanding of etiology and pathophysiology is fragmented and incomplete; b) Sensitive, specific, and cost-effective methods for early detection are not available; c) Therapeutic development is hampered by the heterogeneity and complexity of ADRD; d) Shortage of data and translational scientists; and, e) Inadequate diversity at all levels. The IADRC specific aims entail innovation to overcome these barriers and accelerate research toward prevention and effective treatment: 1) Support, enhance, and expand innovative research on ADRD targeting causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention; 2) Provide critical research resources and infrastructure to support existing studies and enable new innovative research, utilizing a well-characterized longitudinal clinical cohort, with prioritization of diverse populations including underrepresented groups (URG) and those in preclinical and early symptomatic phases, including subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment, which will help to advance the identification of easily accessible biomarkers for early detection; 3) Identify and prioritize novel therapeutic targets from high-throughput approaches with rapid translation to proof- of-concept studies using genetic and other enrichment strategies for better biological targeting and reduction of phenotypic and biological heterogeneity for more efficient and cost-effective clinical trials; 4) Increase the number of investigators with deep expertise in advanced data sciences to bridge cellular/molecular processes of neurodegeneration and clinical phenotypes, as well as clinical and translational researchers who can move therapeutic approaches from model systems to clinical trials; 5) Provide educational and training opportunities related to dementia for a broad array of learners, with special emphasis on increasing participation from URG in ADRD related research and healthcare specialties. The IADRC is well-positioned to help achieve the NIA/NAPA goals through sustained and impactful contributions towards prevention and treatment of AD/ADRD. Project Narrative – Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center The Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (IADRC) is a multidisciplinary research program intensely committed to the U.S. National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by 2025. Major activities include innovative research on causes, early detection, and treatment, including both pharmacological and non-drug approaches, as well as interventions for caregivers and educational programs for researchers and members of the community.

"An acoustofluidic device for diagnosing preclinical Alzheimer's disease Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a crippling, terminal neurodegenerative illness that affects an estimated 5.5 million people in the United States and approximately 10% of the population over the age of 65. Early symptoms of the disease include impairment in recent memory, difficulties with expressive language, and behavioral changes including depressed mood. Symptoms gradually worsen over time, ultimately leading to dementia and a loss of bodily functions. Currently there is no sensitive, objective diagnostic test for the early diagnosis of AD, making it difficult for physicians to properly screen for the disease and failing to diagnose patients that may be positive for AD. While advances have been made in medical imaging for AD, they are extremely costly and have limited diagnostic accuracy. In recent years, neuron-derived exosomes (30-150 nm extracellular vesicles) have emerged as a promising biomarker for diagnosing AD. Neuron-derived exosomes found in circulation can provide a simple, non-invasive means of monitoring the health of the central nervous system. Accumulating evidence suggests that neuron-derived exosomes may play a crucial role in the pathology of AD by helping to spread abnormal, potentially disease-causing, misfolded proteins throughout the brain. Preliminary studies have shown that by analyzing the number of neuron-derived exosomes and their molecular cargo, early-stage AD patients can be distinguished from healthy controls, as well as patients with other neurological diseases. While researchers have made progress in identifying neuron-derived exosomal proteins and RNAs, difficulties surrounding the isolation and analysis of exosomes have prevented their widespread use as a biomarker for AD. Currently, there are no commercially available products capable of simultaneously isolating and analyzing neuron-derived exosomes. The objective of this SBIR project is to overcome the limitations of existing AD diagnostic technologies and address the unmet needs in the market by developing and commercializing an automated, high-purity, high-yield, biocompatible exosome isolation and accurate AD biomarker detection using acoustofluidic (i.e., the fusion of acoustics and fluid mechanics) separation and electrochemical detection technologies. During our work on the Phase I project, we successfully demonstrated the utility and feasibility of the proposed exosome isolation and analysis device for AD diagnosis by meeting or exceeding the target values for each of the four key parameters identified in the Measures of Success. In Phase II, our commercialization activities will improve the performance of the acoustofluidic chips, develop self-contained, beta-testing-ready prototypes, and validate their performance with end users. With its advantages in automation, speed, precision, and accuracy, the proposed acoustofluidic technology has the potential to greatly simplify and revolutionize the diagnosis of AD. The result will be a highly sensitive liquid biopsy that will provide a comprehensive molecular signature for AD, thus significantly improving diagnostic accuracy past existing methods and providing deeper insight in the pathophysiology of the disease. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating terminal disease with no cure, and rapidly increasing worldwide prevalence, posing a global crisis to the healthcare economy. There is a critical need to identify at earlier stages of the disease to better develop preventative and treatment strategies, however there has yet to be a standard test that is easy to admit with a high accuracy at early stages of the disease. The objective of this proposed project is to develop and commercialize an acoustic-based liquid biopsy that will serve as a platform for conducting simple blood tests with rapid processing times and high accuracy for a large suite of exosomal based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease present in the patients’ blood – an industry first.",An acoustofluidic device for diagnosing preclinical

"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as

"Democratising Machine Learning for researchers working in Alzheimer's space RESEARCH SUMMARY One of the key challenges in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the early detection of individuals who are at risk of developing the condition, and subsequently making predictions about how rapidly their condition will progress. To facilitate this, the parent grant of this proposal (R01-AG058676-01A1) brings together ﬁve leading well char- acterized Alzheimer’s cohorts to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s dementia: the Adult Children Study (ACS), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL), the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). The resulting cohort is critical for understanding the factors which precipitate or delay dementia diagnosis. The large size of this dataset motivates the application of machine learn- ing(ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methodologies to address the critical questions of classifying individuals as at risk of AD and for making predictions about the future progression in terms of the disease, symptoms and function.  However, there are stark contrasts between the AD space and those domains where ML/AI techniques have been used to great success, such as computer vision, text mining and audio analytics. In particular, the smaller sample size, even for the largest datasets collected to date, means that highly expressive models are just as likely to detect technical artefacts in the data as real biological signal, especially when looking at high-dimensional in- formation where AI/ML is most appropriate. Moreover, standard ML/AI approaches do not typically work with missing values, a common feature of clinical AD cohorts, where certain types of measurements are difﬁcult to collect. Finally, the areas where AI/ML have fulﬁlled their promise are those where the barrier to entry for both ML and domain specialists has been reduced. This democratisation has been achieved largely by providing bench- mark datasets that have been processed to remove technical artefacts, have comprehensive documentation and adhere to under Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles.  In this grant, we seek to conduct high-resolution, multi-modal harmonisation and cross-dataset imputation of the ﬁve leading AD cohorts aiming to improve their suitability for AI/ML approaches, proving these in a form that is FAIR, well-documented and easy to use with AI/ML frameworks. While the parent grant performs some harmoni- sation of summary statistics (e.g. average amyloid levels from PET imaging, cognitive test summary statistics) and imputation using classical approaches, this extension seeks to improve the level of granularity (e.g entire images, individual or small groups of questions in cognitive tests) at which harmonisation is performed, and incorporate biological prior knowledge into data imputation. This will be achieved by leveraging recent advancements in al- gorithmic bias-removal and matrix completion, and will incorporate our understanding of disease processes and the nature of the modalities being analysed. The latter will put additional constraints on the inferential, allowing it to produce more accurate and sensible estimations of measurements. We will provide FAIR-curated version of these datasets, along with software to enable researchers to adjust the level of harmonisation and imputation as needed, based on the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying algorithms developed and implemented in this proposal.  The integration of the ﬁve largest longitudinal AD cohorts, as per the parent grant of this proposal, provides an invaluable opportunity to explore the power of AI/ML to improve our ability to detect AD early on and make accurate forecasts about individual’s change over time. This proposal seeks to bring modern AI/ML methods ﬁrmly into the AD community by producing curated de-biased datasets that can be seamlessly integrated into most existing ML pipelines. By improving the quality of the underlying data at a higher resolution than has been done before, predictive and prognostics models derived from this work are likely to be substantially more powerful than past approaches. RESEARCH NARRATIVE Recent developments in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated their incredible potential to improve predic- tive models – however, their applicability for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been limited by small datasets with inconsistent or missing measurements and limited documentation, raising the barriers of entry to AI researchers wishing to study AD or AD researchers wishing to apply AI. This study will focus on expanding the curating the ﬁve leading Alzheimer’s cohorts in order to improve their applicability for AI: the Adult Children Study (ACS), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flag- ship Study of Ageing (AIBL), the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). The study will focus on providing well-curated and documented versions of these datasets with the ultimate aim of driving innovation in the application of AI to Alzheimer’s disease and improving our ability to identify factors which precipitate or delay dementia diagnosis.",Democratising Machine Learning for researchers working in Alzheimer's space,10412149,R01AG058676,"['Accounting ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Salvelinus ', ' Chars ', ' Ships ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Specialist ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Children ', ' Modality ', ' Delgamer ', ' Tenuate ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' Documentation ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' file format ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' parent grant ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' data sharing ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' learning community ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' high dimensionality ', ' protective factors ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' prognostic model ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE,R01,2021,211898,
"Longitudinal predictive modeling for tau in Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by a cognitively asymptomatic preclinical stage which is identified and monitored via longitudinal tracking of pathophysiological biomarkers, e.g., tau and amyloid. Since the aggregation of tau protein tangles in the medial temporal lobe is a key driver of memory impairment, accurate image-based longitudinal prediction of tau burden could fill a critical gap in biomarker development for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. Tau tangles exhibit stereotypical neuroanatomical patterns of spatiotemporal spread that correlate strongly with the progression of neurodegeneration. Studies in animal models have suggested that the characteristic patterns of tau spread associated with Alzheimer’s progression are determined by neural connectivity rather than physical proximity between different brain regions. Graph-theoretic methods that utilize macroscale structural connectivity mapping in humans to predict future tau burden could lead to valuable prognostic tools for Alzheimer’s disease. The overarching research goal of this R01 Research Project Grant is to develop an interpretable machine learning model that uses individual structural connectomics to make personalized predictions of differential measures of tau from multimodal baseline data. Our approach relies on longitudinal 18F-Flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) for the imaging of tau tangles, 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) for the imaging of amyloid plaques, and high-angular-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for individualized structural connectomics in human subjects. We will develop a physics-informed and interpretable graph neural network to predict the annual rate of change of the regional tau burden from multimodal inputs, including baseline tau, Aβ, and an array of structural connectivity metrics. We will also develop novel physics-based analytic models for tau progression, which will be used to effectively guide the machine learning framework. Finally, we will apply the machine learning model to investigate the earliest cortical site of tau aggregation, to examine the connectomic basis of early tau spread, and to leverage our model’s interpretability to discover and validate novel connectomic biomarkers to characterize preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To validate the machine learning model, we will use serial tau PET data at two and three timepoints from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, one of the largest longitudinal imaging resources for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the models will be performed using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The proposed personalized predictive model could significantly impact preclinical Alzheimer’s prognosis, facilitate ongoing clinical trials, and shed light on the neuroconnectomic and biological underpinnings of Alzheimer’s disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this Research Project Grant is to develop methods for modeling the spread of tau tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, along the structural network of the brain. Novel artificial intelligence tools will be developed that accurately predict the progression of tau.

"Stricker Learning Span: A Computer Adaptive Word List Memory Test Optimized for Remote Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Due to COVID-19, remote cognitive assessment has transitioned from an important research aim to an immediate and urgent research and clinical need. This need has underscored the lack of well-validated, sensitive, reliable, and well-normed tests available for remote assessment. Word list memory performance changes early in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), up to 20 years prior to onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although delayed word list recall is viewed as the most sensitive memory measure in studies of MCI and AD dementia, traditional word list memory test paradigms require interactive administration with an examiner. Further, recency effects may influence the sensitivity of delayed word list recall: correct recall of words at the end of the list during immediate recall trials may represent attentional span/working memory for some individuals. When these words are subsequently not recalled at delay, they are considered forgotten, but an alternate view is that the words were never fully encoded during repeated learning trials. In line with this, the central deficit in AD may be one of learning. To help address the critical need for a sensitive and brief remote learning measure, we have developed a new word list learning paradigm. The Stricker Learning Span (SLS) aims to achieve the known sensitivity of word list memory tests to the earliest preclinical AD changes while allowing reliable remote self-administration on a smartphone or alternative device (e.g., PC, tablet) through a web-based platform. This flexible approach is necessary to reach the most users and eliminate potential health disparities. We have transformed the traditional manner of administering a word list memory test in several important ways, resulting in a novel paradigm that takes full advantage of computer- based administration through use of a computer adaptive testing procedure focused on learning, visual presentation of the word list, 4-choice recognition to assess words learned, and a complete data capture approach to allow future studies focused on process-based measures and application of machine learning techniques. This study will leverage the resources of the ongoing population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, which already incorporates in-clinic and remote computerized cognitive assessment. Specifics aims include to (1) determine the acceptability and efficiency of the unsupervised SLS, (2) demonstrate the construct validity of the SLS by examining association with a traditional word list memory measure, (3) determine the criterion validity of the SLS through sensitivity to preclinical AD (cross-sectional effect sizes between cognitively unimpaired amyloid PET positive and negative groups) and associations with continuous AD neuroimaging biomarkers (tau PET, hippocampal volume) in all participants with neuroimaging data, and (4) determine 7.5 month test-retest reliability for the SLS. Sensitive, remotely administered computerized measures will help to identify individuals with preclinical AD for anti-amyloid and anti-tau clinical trials, as well as individuals meeting criteria for treatment once anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapies are approved. PROJECT NARRATIVE/LAY SUMMARY There is a critical need to develop tools to assess cognitive function remotely for both research and clinical purposes. The Stricker Learning Span is a novel computer adaptive word list memory test that has strong potential to be sensitive to preclinical Alzheimer’s disease, in addition to aging and other neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIA’s mission and will specifically (1) improve our understanding of the aging brain, Alzheimer’s disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases and (2) promote broad use and dissemination of digital technology for early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline in aging, Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementias.",Stricker Learning Span: A Computer Adaptive Word List Memory Test Optimized for Remote Assessment,10295468,R21AG073967,"['Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computers ', ' Floor ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Specificity ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Verbal Learning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Immediate Recalls ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' remote learning ', ' Distance Learning ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' response ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' population based ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2021,437250,MN-01
"Towards a better understanding of genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC models PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability (~70%). It is increasingly clear that AD is highly polygenic, and for most of AD cases it is the polygenicity of the risk variants across the genome that predisposes the disease risk. In contrast to the rapid identification of risk loci associated with AD by recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identifying the potential causal variants/genes at the reported risk loci and decoding these variants/genes into molecular and cellular pathology have lagged far behind. Since disease variants, mostly locating in noncoding regions of the human genome, have been shown to affect cellular function through multi-level regulations such as DNA accessibility and histone modifications, DNA methylation and RNA expression in a cell type-specific manner, comprehensive and unbiased investigating the cell type-specific influence of generic risk variants on AD risk at multiple levels, including epigenomic, transcriptomic, and cellular levels, in an isogenic background is crucial to understand the genetic basis of AD pathogenesis. In the current application, by combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, we will dissect the AD genetic risk variants into cell type-specific molecular and cellular pathology. Given the polygenic nature of AD, and the heterogeneity of AD risk genes on the cellular level, we hypothesize that multiple genetic risk variants act synergistically among different compartments (e.g. cell types) to contribute to pathogenesis of AD. First, we will identify AD risk variants and genes with comprehensive analyses of AD genetic architecture using machine learning approaches including DVAR, eVAR and iRIGS (Aim 1). Second, we will delineate the cell type-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures associated with AD candidate risk variants using human iPSC-derived neurons/microglia/astrocytes (Aim 2). Last, we will determine the functional impact of AD candidate risk variants on AD-like cellular pathology in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and their co-cultures (Aim 3). Our proposal may advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of AD, leading to a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AD have identified more than 20 risk loci, the genetic etiology of AD leading to molecular and cellular pathology remains largely unknown. By combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, our investigation will reveal the cell type-specific effects of AD genetic risk variants on AD pathogenesis, which may advance our understanding of genetic architecture of AD and disease etiology, and lead to therapeutic advances.",Towards a better understanding of

"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET- positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD all measures; controls – clinical and cognitive measures only) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),10233958,U01AG057195,"['Age

"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve access and engagement in AD research among disadvantaged groups.",Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with

"Machine and deep learning for finding multimodal imaging biomarkers in prodromal AD Our proposed study focuses on developing deep neural networks and sophisticated multivariate analysis methods for studying episodic memory activations in prodromal AD subjects and age-matched normal controls. We are particularly interested in investigating the effects of spatial and object pattern-separation in subfields of the hippocampus, nearby regions of the medial temporal lobe, and functional whole-brain connections. In order to acquire a fuller understanding of the underlying physiological processes driving AD pathology, activations in hippocampal subfields must be investigated in further depth and with methodologies that exceed the current limitations of fMRI at 3T. Acquiring data that will yield a more accurate view of these hippocampal interactions is far more easily facilitated with 7T technology, although barriers complicate such a study even at 7T. Our proposed study centers on circumventing these barriers, particularly data contamination from excessive system noise, head-motion noise, and physiological noise which is proportional to the field strength, to develop methods that will allow investigators to work within the parameters of 7T at its fullest capacity toward the development of more powerful imaging biomarkers for diagnosing AD. To increase the likelihood of the successful completion of our study, we consider it imperative to develop better task fMRI designs and imaging protocols (Aim 1), automatic segmentation methods (Aim 2), noise-reduction methods (Aim 3), and multivariate analysis methods, such as novel algorithms and software tools based on constrained canonical correlation analysis (constrained CCA), kernel CCA, and deep CCA and relevant group-level analysis using fusion CCA, multiset CCA, and machine learning and deep learning techniques (Aim 4) for studying memory function to obtain novel imaging biomarkers (Aim 5) to identify individuals at risk for AD. This study will enable the creation of clearer and more detailed brain activation maps and thus promote the discovery of currently unknown aspects of brain function in prodromal AD. The successful completion of our objectives could lead to more effective diagnostic tools for AD, including an fMRI-based diagnostic test for memory impairment to characterize abnormal memory function in people at risk for AD. Our advanced methodology, combining 7T high-resolution fMRI, automatic segmentation, data denoising and multivariate analysis, will be essential for detecting subtle functional changes in subfields of the hippocampus and its connections to other cortical regions. Results from this study are expected to broadly impact scientific understanding of brain function beyond only enhancing current understanding of memory function in AD. We anticipate that the methods developed from findings acquired in our proposed study will have a far-reaching influence on improving fMRI data quality, enable more accurate detection of brain activation, open a path toward better automated and instantaneous hippocampal subfield segmentation for many other MRI/fMRI applications of neurodegenerative diseases, and contribute new and vital discoveries to the field of neuroscience in general. Project narrative The proposed study is highly relevant to public health because advanced mathematical and statistical methods will allow for more in-depth analysis of high-resolution fMRI data, in particular, data used in the characterization of brain function, which offers significant potential for more effective diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study will investigate memory activation in the medial temporal lobes with high-resolution imaging at 7 Tesla with multivariate analysis to identify brain dysfunction in prodromal AD. The methods developed from the findings acquired in this study will have a far-reaching influence on MRI/fMRI research in neurodegenerative diseases by improving fMRI data quality, facilitating automated and instantaneous brain segmentation, and more accurately identifying individuals at risk for AD.",Machine and deep learning for finding multimodal imaging biomarkers in prodromal

"Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration Project Summary / Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Pathological changes in the brain can be observed at least 15 years before clinical symptoms (preclinical stage). An early and accurate diagnosis tool could save $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs. Moreover, an effective therapeutic strategy could improve the clinical outcome if delivered early. There is a clear need to develop cost-effective and non-invasive biomarkers for AD that can be used to identify individuals before symptoms emerge and patients at early-symptomatic stages of disease. These novel biomarkers could be also leveraged to monitor disease progression and responses to therapies. Cell-free nucleic acids diagnostic tests have revolutionized prenatal screening, and cancer research, diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, specific transcripts ascertained from cell-free RNA have been evaluated as biomarkers for AD, but so far, no high throughput approach has been attempted. The goal of this proposal is to use high throughput sequencing of cell-free nucleic acids from plasma to construct a prediction model for neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that there are detectable changes in plasma cell-free nucleic acids that are related to AD. During the K99 phase, I aim to predict accurately AD cases using cell-free nucleic acid and bioinformatics tools, including machine learning. Briefly, I will sequence cell-free RNA present in longitudinal samples of plasma from AD cases and controls, then build a predictive model. I will replicate this model in an independent dataset of preclinical samples. I will include samples from mutation carriers and non-European ancestry to validate the model. I will also determine if the model can predict other neurodegenerative diseases or if it is specific to AD by quantifying plasma transcripts from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. My preliminary data show that this approach is feasible. I designed a preliminary predictive model with 10 AD cases and 10 controls that has an area under the ROC curve of 1; then I replicated it in independent samples (n=20) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84. In four preclinical samples the ROC was 0.86 suggesting that my model can also identify pre-symptomatic individuals. It is possible to improve this model by using more powerful informatics approaches. Using deep neural networks, I obtained a ROC of 1 in the discovery dataset and 0.94 in the replication dataset. During the R00 phase, I plan to use the same approach on other neurodegenerative diseases to design specific predictive models. I will generate sequence data on the RNA present in longitudinal plasma samples of cases and controls from Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies to construct specific predictive models for each of them. Then I will replicate the models in preclinical samples of these diseases. Combining the information on all neurodegenerative diseases will also allow me to refine the predictive model and perform integrative analyses to describe mechanistic insights. My ultimate goal is to be able to use the predictive models as diagnostic tools, and if possible, as early diagnostic tests. The preliminary data is encouraging and opens the possibility of having plasma-based tests for neurodegeneration. Project Narrative This proposal will use transcriptomic data from plasma to model a predictive tool for Alzheimer Disease using bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. This is an innovative approach, a cost-effective and minimally invasive biomarker for Alzheimer Disease, which is critical for early detection (preclinical), diagnosis, disease intervention and monitoring. If successful, the results will lead to a breakthrough in the field.",Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration,10090547,K99AG062723,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD

"KBASE2: Korean Brain Aging Study, Longitudinal Endophenotypes and Systems Biology Project Summary/Abstract The Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of AD (KBASE) is a comprehensive prospective cohort study launched at Seoul National University (SNU) in 2014 using a similar design and methods as the North American Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The KBASE cohort consists of well-characterized participants including cognitively normal (CN) controls with a wide age range (20 to 90 years), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia (AD). A unique aspect of KBASE is the systematic longitudinal collection of comprehensive clinical, cognitive and lifestyle data, multimodal neuroimaging (MRI/MRA, DTI, rsfMRI, amyloid, tau and FDG PET), and bio-specimens in Korea for the first five years (“KBASE1”). Some KBASE data have been analyzed and reported but much of the extensive KBASE data set and samples await comprehensive analysis. The proposed project (“KBASE2”) represents a collaboration between the NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and partners, Indiana University (ADNI Genetics Core, Indiana NIA-designated ADRC, and IU Network Science Institute), the KBASE team at SNU in Korea, University of Southern California (USC), and the University of Pennsylvania. Over 1000 whole genome sequences (WGS) of Korean participants will be contributed to the ADSP, and the extensive ADSP multi-ethnic data set will be analyzed. WGS data will be harmonized by the NIA Genetics and Genomics Center for AD (GCAD) and shared via the NIA Genetics of AD Data Storage Site (NIAGADS). The Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI) at USC will support sharing of MRI and PET and related endophenotypes, as it does for ADNI. KBASE2 will continue longitudinal data and sample collection and provide high throughput WGS and RNA-Seq as well as data harmonization and sharing (Aim 1), perform intensive brain network-based analyses of longitudinal amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration and vascular (A/T/N/V) imaging biomarkers in relation to clinical data (Aim 2), employ integrative systems biology and functional genomics methods to analyze multi-omics data for association with A/T/N/V biomarkers for AD, and provide new insight into AD biomarker-related dysregulated gene modules and pathways (Aim 3). The overarching concepts driving this multidisciplinary international collaborative project are that 1) development of precision medicine for AD and related disorders (ADRD) requires systematic multi-modal biomarker collection in diverse cohorts during early at-risk stages of disease to identify robust diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets and 2) sophisticated analytic strategies that address the complexity of multi- layer multimodal data and heterogeneous and diverse participant cohorts are essential. We hypothesize that integrative longitudinal analysis of genetic and -omics networks with structural and functional brain networks will yield new diagnostic and treatment-relevant insights related to A/T/N/V and other aging related pathways. Results of this collaboration and data sharing will facilitate translation of ADSP findings for therapeutic development in support of the National Alzheimer's Project Act goal of prevention and treatment of AD by 2025. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias are a widely recognized major public health problem in the U.S. and globally. The proposed international collaborative project will contribute rich longitudinal biomarker and clinical data and over 1000 whole genome sequences on a Korean cohort to the NIA AD Sequencing Project and related research programs. Well-characterized multi-ethnic genomic data sets are a major priority for AD research. KBASE2 brings a multidisciplinary team together to complete state of the science integrative analyses of the clinical, genetic, brain network and multi-omics data to accelerate the identification of new potential therapeutic targets.","KBASE2: Korean Brain Aging Study, Longitudinal Endophenotypes and Systems Biology",10199190,U01AG072177,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", '

"Causal and integrative deep learning for Alzheimer's disease genetics Summary  In response to PAR-19-269, “Cognitive Systems Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetic and Phenotypic Data”, we propose developing and applying more powerful and robust machine learning methods for causal and integrative analysis, especially deep learning approaches for instrumental variable analysis, to identify causal risk/protective factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the post-GWAS era by leveraging published large-scale GWAS, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other omic and neuroimaging data. Our main motivation is to ex- tend an emerging and increasingly inﬂuential approach of integrating GWAS with gene expression data, called transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), aiming to improve over the current practice of GWAS by not only increasing statistical power, but also identifying (putative) causal genes, thus gaining insights into the genetic basis of common diseases and complex traits. The statistical principle underlying TWAS is the (two-sample) two-stage least squares (2SLS) for linear models in the framework of instrumental variable (IV) analysis for causal inference. In practice, however, TWAS may fail to identify true causal genes while giving false positives due to the violation of its modeling assumptions, e.g., due to non-linear effects of IVs or gene expression, or due to invalid IVs (in the presence of horizontal pleiotropy of SNPs). First, we propose developing linear models and neural network models incorporating a large number of functional annotations on the genome (e.g. various types of functional genomic and epigenetic data from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects) as prior knowledge to improve im- puting/predicting gene expression (or other molecular or imaging endophenotypes or complex traits/diseases) via SNPs, corresponding to the ﬁrst stage of 2SLS. Second, we propose neural networks as more ﬂexible non-linear models for the second stage of 2SLS in the presence of invalid IVs, which may be the SNPs having direct (or horizontal pleiotropic) effects on the outcome as expected from the wide-spread pleiotropy. Then we combine the approaches in the above two stages to form a more ﬂexible and robust neural network approach as an extension of 2SLS for causal inference. Third, we consider inferring causal directions between two traits, e.g. a gene's expres- sion and AD, allowing non-linear relationships between SNPs and traits and between the two traits. This is critical in reducing false positives, e.g. due to reverse causation, but has been largely under-studied. Fourth, we apply the new (and existing) methods to transcriptomic, proteomic, neuroimaging and AD GWAS/WGS data to identify (pu- tative) causal genes, proteins and brain regions of interest (ROIs) for AD, while building the corresponding genetic prediction models for endophenotypes and AD risk. Finally, we will develop and disseminate publicly available software implementing the proposed analysis methods, e.g. as Python programs or R packages, to facilitate the wide use by the scientiﬁc community. Project Narrative  This proposed research is expected to not only identify novel and (putative) causal genes, proteins and brain re- gions for Alzheimer's disease through integrative post-GWAS data analysis, but also contribute powerful and robust statistical and machine learning methods for causal inference as valuable computational tools for the elucidation of genetic components of common diseases, thus facilitating their prevention, early diagnosis and therapeutic development.",Causal and integrative deep learning for Alzheimer's disease genetics,10267373,U01AG073079,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Operant Conditioning ', ' Instrumental Learning ', ' instrumental conditioning ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Influentials ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tweens ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Pythons ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' trait ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' Proteomics ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' functional genomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Protein Region ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Molecular ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' cognitive system ', ' endophenotype ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' phenotypic data ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' protective factors ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' neural network ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2021,733352,MN-05
"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data. This project constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to foster regional synergy and multilevel research towards the harmonization of global strategies to fight dementia in SAC.",US-South American

"Exploring mechanisms driving microbe-induced AD risk using next generation sequence data. Multiple lines of evidence suggest microbial infections are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides possess antimicrobial activity and may protect against human herpes viruses (HHV). Viral DNA is also detectable in Aβ plaques, and HHV DNA detected in next generation sequencing (NGS) experiments is associated with AD risk. Although neuroinflammation is the mechanism assumed to drive this association, several questions remain. Foremost, it is unclear whether infections precede AD or are the result of an aging immune system or AD pathology itself. The specific aspects of AD pathology that are affected by infections are also unknown, as is the role of the host genome in mediating risk. The objective of this project is to answer these questions by leveraging large AD cohorts with NGS data derived from blood and brain samples to detect the presence of microbial DNA. Microbial DNA can be detected and quantified in human NGS experiments by aligning reads that do not map to the human genome to microbial reference genomes, and depending on the species identified, may be evidence of either an active or latent infection. Any microbe for which a reference genome is available can be detected. The cohorts include the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD), and Gwangju Alzheimer's & Related Dementias project (GARD). The long-term goal of this project is to provide evidence that interventions targeting microbial infections could prevent AD or slow its progression. Our central hypothesis is that infections increase AD risk and cause observable changes to specific facets of AD pathology. We also hypothesize that variants in the human genome mediate these processes. We will test these hypotheses through the following specific aims. In Aim1, we will develop a pipeline to accurately quantify and match DNA fragments generated by next generation sequencing to microbial DNA sequences, including inserted viral DNA. In Aim2, we will leverage longitudinally followed cohorts with multi-omics data to establish a temporal relationship between infection and AD, and test for associations between microbial DNA and AD-related traits, including biomarkers, structural brain changes measured by magnetic resonance imaging, neuropathological traits, disease progression, brain cell type sub-fractions, and cognitive function. In Aim3, we explore the role of the host genome in mediating microbe induced AD pathology, including testing for associations between SNPs and microbes, and for interactions between known AD risk variants/HLA serotypes and microbial DNA to predict AD. This project is significant because it could provide evidence that preventing or treating infections could treat or prevent AD. The project is innovative because it will be the first to leverage very large AD NGS cohorts, in many of which the tissue used for DNA sequencing was collected prior to AD diagnosis, and use case-only analysis to link microbial DNA to specific aspects of AD pathology. Microbial infections are likely risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Evidence of infections can be found by aligning DNA fragments from samples collected in humans to microbial reference genomes. This project will leverage large, existing next generation sequencing cohorts of AD cases in controls to explore mechanisms driving microbe-mediated AD risk, including the role of variants in the human genome.",Exploring mechanisms driving microbe-induced AD risk using next generation sequence data.,10381136,R01AG076002,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', '

"Delaying Alzheimer's Disease Progression Through Intranasally Administered Nano-Antioxidants Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the neuropathological accumulation of amyloid beta (Ab) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau. Recent data from multiple groups support that given enough time, Ab and tau spreads throughout the brain in a well-defined manner along brain networks, very similar to the way a prion protein travels throughout the brain. Notably, the olfactory system has been reported to be one of the first systems affected in AD. Our past work has focused on using Manganese Enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to assess axonal transport in the olfactory system in mouse models of AD. Indeed, we have reported that axonal transport deficits in the olfactory system are detectable prior to the development of learning and memory deficits and well before plaque formation. These data are consistent with the idea that AD pathology spreads throughout the brain, beginning with the olfactory system. Additionally, our prior work has also focused on the effects of reducing oxidative stress in mouse models of AD. When we reduced oxidative stress by overexpressing superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD-2) in mouse models of AD, we observed a complete recovery in learning and memory deficits, a complete recovery in axonal transport deficits in the olfactory system as well as an over 50% reduction in Ab plaque formation. Although oxidative stress has been identified as a significant player in the development of AD, efforts to reduce oxidative stress with antioxidants has met with limited success. Some of the reasons for this are thought to include the inability to target sufficient quantities of administered antioxidants to the appropriate regions within the brain. Additionally, clinically available antioxidants have poor solubility and do not readily enter cells. Thus, we have turned to nanotechnology and have been working with nano-antioxidants that are much more potent than clinically available antioxidants, are non-toxic and readily enter cells. We therefore hypothesize that protecting olfactory and adjoining structures with intranasally administered nano-antioxidants (PEG-HCCs) will slow down the progression of AD as assessed with behavioral assays, MEMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) as well as 31P measurements and histology. We will also incorporate machine learning, specifically, a probabilistic graphical model, to determine the interactions of the readouts in Aims 1 and 2 in mouse models of AD and controls with and without treatment with PEG-HCCs. We also propose to incorporate machine learning to predict 1) the degree to which superoxide levels should be reduced to improve AD pathology and 2) which stages of AD (e.g. pre vs post plaque) are beyond rescue. Completion of this highly innovative project will have significant impact towards future AD therapeutic strategies. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are conducting research that will advance our understanding of network spread that occurs in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) leading from the olfactory system but also the roles of oxidative stress in AD. As a result, the proposed work is relevant to the component of NIH’s mission of developing novel and innovative methods such as machine learning to understand and potentially treat AD, a disease that is on the rise and has significant health consequences.",Delaying Alzheimer's Disease Progression Through Intranasally Administered Nano-Antioxidants,10395142,R56AG071152,"['Recovery ', ' Measurement

"Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease. The greatest treatment potential lies in early stages before irreversible brain damage occurs. Early treatment requires early detection of the disease. Imaging holds great promise for capturing early signs of AD. This capability can be substantially strengthened by integrating neuroimages of different modalities that characterize brain structure and function from complementary aspects. However, although various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to integrate multi-modality images for diagnosis and prognosis of AD, there is a lack of novel, robust, effective algorithms to address patient-wise missing modalities in the integration. In real clinical data, it is inevitable that some image modalities are unavailable to some patients due to high cost, insurance coverage, and safety constraints. Thus, the existing algorithms may only work for a small portion of patients who have complete modalities. This significantly reduces the access to advanced imaging-based diagnostic systems from the general patient population and in broad clinical settings. Because of the limited clinical utility, it is difficult to commercialize the existing ML algorithms into clinical systems/products, whereas the current imaging-based products on the market focus on single image modalities or image measurement, processing, visualization, and statistical analysis (without advanced ML capabilities). To fill the unmet market niche, this STTR Phase II project will develop the first-ever broadly-applicable clinical decision support system, Multi-neuroimaging for Detecting AD (Mind-AD), which can accommodate varying availability of image modalities across different patients to build classifiers and provide accurate diagnosis and prognosis of AD for each individual at the early MCI stage. Our Phase I has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Mind-AD system. At Phase II, we propose functional optimization and validation of Mind-AD in three aims. Aim 1 will optimize the accuracy and robustness of the diagnostic/prognostic models by integrating our Phase I IMTL model with efficient PSO feature selection. The integrated IMTL-PSO is very efficient in selecting optimal feature subsets to yield accurate, robust diagnostic/prognostic models especially on independent validation datasets. Aim 2 will develop a novel IMTL- DL (deep learning) model to integrate incomplete multi-modality volumetric images. While IMTL-PSO is based on features defined using anatomical knowledge of the brain, IMTL-DL extracts features in a data-driven manner. Aim 3 will integrate IMTL-PSO and IMTL-DL through decision fusion to best leverage their complementary, joint strength, and validate the resulting Mind-AD system using two independent datasets. Our project is significant because Mind-AD is the first early diagnostic/prognostic system for AD using advanced ML algorithms to integrate incomplete multi-modality image datasets. Mind-AD will facilitate early detection, early intervention, patient selection in drug trials targeting the early stage, and will help achieve these goals in in broad clinical settings due to the capability of accommodating varying availability of image modalities from different patients. The public health relevance of this project is to provide a clinical decision support system, Mind-AD, to facilitate accurate diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the early stage, through novel machine learning integration of multi- modality image datasets with patient-specific missing modalities. Early detection and early intervention bear the greatest potential for combating this devastating disease. Therefore, our system helps address the serious public health concern regarding AD which currently affects over 5.5 million people and incurs over $200 billion health care cost per year in the

"Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Over the last decade, scientists have accelerated their efforts to understand Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This has led to unprecedented knowledge of the genetic and biological bases of AD risk, and vast stores of valuable data for further mining. Understanding the genetic and biological risk states for AD is, in itself, extraordinarily valuable for guiding mechanistic studies, developing better diagnostics, and formulating therapeutics. But an understanding of risk states also has the benefit of allowing research on resilience to AD. Research on the genetic and biological bases of resilience necessarily lags behind the discovery of risk factors. Now, as the risk architecture of AD is coming into view, it is feasible to study resilience to AD in individuals who are cognitively normal despite being at elevated risk for the disease. The approach we have devised for identifying resilience factors is straightforward yet, to our knowledge, unprecedented. We identify unaffected individuals at the highest levels of multivariate risk, match them to affected individuals at equivalent levels of risk, and contrast these two subgroups to find residual variation associated with the absence of disease. In this project, we will capitalize on the wealth of existing high-throughput AD risk-factor results and data, and our involvement in many of the world’s largest AD consortia, to efficiently map resilience to AD at three levels (genetics, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging), and to integrate across these levels. In Aim 1, we will identify genetic variation associated with resilience to AD in the presence of elevated genetic risk conferred by APOE ε4 alleles, an elevated AD polygenic risk score, or an elevated AD polygenic hazard score. In Aim 2, we will mega-analyze all available transcriptomic data from studies of postmortem hippocampal tissue and of peripheral blood in AD to identify transcriptomic risk scores and machine-learning algorithms that maximally distinguish AD from cognitively normal control subjects, and scores and algorithms that then identify residual transcriptomic variation that offsets the transcriptomic risk in resilient controls. In Aim 3, we will identify an MRI-based structural brain signature that is associated with resilience to AD in the presence of an AD- associated cortical risk signature. Lastly, in our exploratory Aim 4, we will integrate genetic, transcriptomic, brain structural, and clinical data to identify biological relationships across Aims, and novel phenotypes of resilience. Collectively, these Aims will identify multivariate, genetic, transcriptomic, and brain-structural profiles of resilience to AD, as well as molecular, neurobiological, and clinical phenotypes stemming from AD- resilience genotypes. Project Narrative Not all people at high risk for Alzheimer's disease develop the disorder. This project aims to identify genes, molecules, and brain structures that protect some people from their otherwise-elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Finding the biological basis for resilience to Alzheimer's disease may shed light on better options for diagnosing, treating, and even preventing the illness, in ways that can't be found by only studying people who already have the disease.","Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease",10212961,R01AG064955,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' APOE e4 ', ' APOE-ε4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' brain tissue ', ' interest ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' resilience ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' phenome ', ' genetic predictors ', ' Genetic study ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' secondary analysis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', "" Alzheimer's disease brain "", "" Alzheimer's brain "", ' polygenic risk score ', ' Data Store ', ' biomarker signature ', ' ']",NIA,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,759051,NY-24
"Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease resulting in loss of cognitive and bodily function, and no cure or effective treatment currently exists. While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein aggregation, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and metabolic defects, the exact mechanism of neuronal death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. The goal of this research project is to test whether molecular and cellular dysfunction can be transmitted from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To achieve this goal, we will first map the functional connectivity between regions of brain in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, observe how these connections change over the progression of the disease, and link these functional changes to behavioral phenotypes in animals. We will then profile levels of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites in tissue from several brain regions in these same mice, and observe whether changes in immunometabolic state coincide in time and space with the functional connections measured by MRI. Successful completion of this work will test a potential mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease spreading through the brain, and provide a map of coupling between immune, metabolic, and functional pathology that could open new directions for future development of early disease diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein build-up, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and faulty metabolism, the exact mechanism of brain cell death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. We propose that the dysfunctional cellular state leading to brain cell death is transferred from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To test this idea, we will map paths of brain activity using neuroimaging in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease, measure the corresponding levels of immune markers and metabolic function in each brain region, and then overlay these maps to understand how they correspond over the course of disease. This study combines cutting-edge neuroimaging and molecular assays along with machine learning and computational modeling to test a proposed mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease progression, with the

"Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and a major public health crisis, currently affecting over 5.8 million Americans and expected to rise as the population ages. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can identify the hallmark proteinopathies of AD, including amyloid protein plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (composed primarily of tau protein) accumulating in the brain. While there is evident need for more PET neuroimaging, for example, to elucidate the sequence of amyloid and tau deposition in preclinical AD, its increased utility in longitudinal imaging studies with large study populations is limited by recruitment and cost. In particular, making multiple visits to the scanning site will be difficult for participants living far away, and the high cost of injected radiotracers will limit the scalability of PET studies.  In this project we propose using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for imaging AD. Our specific aims are (1) to validate the diagnostic value of the CNNs in actual ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau imaging sessions, with the injected dose as low as 1% of the original, and with actual ultra-low-dose data, to validate simulations for use in subsequent aims and future studies; (2) to apply the ultra-low-dose CNN to data collected on other PET systems and tracers, in order to demonstrate the CNN’s generalizability; and (3) to evaluate the value of deep learning-aided ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for tracking cognitive decline in a preclinical AD population.  The innovation of this work lies in using multimodal imaging in addition to advanced machine learning techniques to enable acquisition of diagnostic-level PET images at extremely low dose levels. Performing actual ultra-low-dose PET acquisitions is also highly novel in itself. The outcome of this proposal is removing the limiting factors to large-scale clinical longitudinal imaging, shortening acquisitions spanning multiple days and visits to several hours in one visit with a successive ultra-low-dose and full-dose dual-tracer scan protocol. Significant dose reduction can also be achieved, allowing for more frequent amyloid/tau PET scanning. This flexibility will not only increase the utility of PET, aid longitudinal studies in dementia, but enable future comprehensive imaging of multiple PET-based biomarkers as these tracers are being developed. Project Narrative  More frequent PET scans can be used for dementia, a major cause of deaths in the United States, to understand the pathogenesis of the brain proteinopathies involved, to identify at-risk individuals, and to provide outcome markers for clinical trials of anti-amyloid/tau therapies; but recruitment for studies, cost, and radiation dose to the scanned participant are critical factors limiting its use. This work aims to train versatile deep learning-based neural networks which can produce diagnostic-level images from ultra-low-dose (as low as 1%) amyloid and tau PET acquisitions. Our study will provide flexibility in recruitment (running ultra-low-dose and full-dose scans in succession for dual-tracer studies), reduce the cost for radiotracer use, and reduce the dose in scanned participants, a “win-win” for researchers and patients.",Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease,10214874,K99AG068310,"['Affect
