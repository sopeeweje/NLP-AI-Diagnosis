"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10190936,R01DK125562,"['Affect ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Beds ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cleft Palate ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Germ Layers ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Individuality ', ' Maps ', ' Methylation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Tail ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Dietary Supplementation ', ' diet supplementation ', ' Micronutrients ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' cell type ', ' Maternal Nutrition ', ' Maternal diet ', ' maternal nutrition during pregnancy ', ' mother nutrition ', ' IAP Elements ', ' Intracisternal A-Particle ', ' Intracisternal A-Particle Elements ', ' Retrotransposon ', ' offspring ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Modeling ', ' Assisted Reproduction Technology ', ' assistive reproductive technology ', ' Assisted Reproductive Technology ', ' Genomics ', ' embryo culture ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Inbred Mouse ', ' Supplementation ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Seminal ', ' Nutritional Study ', ' Nutrition Research ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' mouse genome ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' critical period ', ' mouse development ', ' comparative genomics ', ' transgenerational epigenetic inheritance ', ' transgenerational inheritance ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' interindividual variability ', ' interindividual variation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' early pregnancy ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' DNA methylation profiling ', ' Methyl-Seq ', ' MethylSeq ', ' Methylation sequencing ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,462430,TX-09
"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although up to 40% of adult patients are responsive to standard chemotherapy, almost all relapse and progress to resistant disease. Most AML patients display no cytogenetic abnormalities or driver mutations, which poses a significant challenge for designing targeted therapy. Combination therapy may also be useful for preventing resistance and improving overall survival. Recent advances in epigenomics have shed light on cellular reprogramming in cancer. Epigenetic proteins can modulate gene expression to induce pathways that increase cell proliferation and decrease differentiation. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is an epigenetic protein overexpressed in AML. CARM1 has been identified as a key regulator of myeloid differentiation and cancer progression; and is overexpressed in primary, resistant, and recurrent AML. CARM1’s mechanistic role in AML induction and progression (including relevant substrates and regulation) is still unclear, which presents an additional challenge for clinicians to design new therapies. To address gaps in our current understanding of CARM1 function and the need for new AML therapies, I aim to (1) Identify compounds that target CARM1 expression and compounds that work in synergy with a known CARM1 inhibitor in AML and (2) Identify novel chemotypes that directly inhibit CARM1 using a hybrid approach of machine learning and simulations of small molecule-protein interactions. These aims support key goals of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Precision Medicine Initiative, including (1) understanding cancer progression, (2) genomic analysis, (3) advancing precision medicine, (4) bioinformatics and (5) translational research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse. We propose to create new therapies for repressing AML based on targeting the epigenome, or the pattern of chemical modification of DNA and histones, the proteins that package and order DNA to promote gene expression.",Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML,10056204,F31CA228331,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosome abnormality ', ' Aberrant Chromosome ', ' Chromosomal Aberrations ', ' Chromosomal Abnormalities ', ' Chromosomal Alterations ', ' Chromosome Aberrations ', ' Chromosome Alterations ', ' Chromosome Anomalies ', ' Cytogenetic Aberrations ', ' Cytogenetic Abnormalities ', ' chromosomal defect ', ' chromosome defect ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Synergism ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Histones ', ' Hybrids ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making. Narrative Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,10238766,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Methods ', ' Oropharyngeal Neoplasms ', ' Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharynx Neoplasms ', ' Oropharynx Tumor ', ' oral pharyngeal neoplasm ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Institution ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Validation ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' miRNA expression profiling ', ' MicroRNA Expression Profiling ', ' global miRNA profiling ', ' miRNA sequencing ', ' miRNA-seq ', ' micro RNA expression profiling ', ' microRNA profiling ', ' microRNA sequencing ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' microRNA markers ', ' prognostic assays ', ' prognostic test ', ' treatment risk ', ' prognostic model ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,378722,IL-07
"High-throughput detection of transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic variation and kinetics using MarathonRT Project Summary The discovery and characterization of an efficient, ultraprocessive reverse transcriptase (MarathonRT) now makes it possible to develop high-throughput methods for accurate end-to- end sequencing of long RNA transcripts, thereby preserving information content on alternative splicing, editing and modification isoforms while conserving positional linkage information, thereby enabling one to distinguish RNA isoforms in complex mixtures without mapping to a reference genome. This type of technology is essential for deciphering the role of post- transcriptional RNA processing events during control of developmental stage, cell and tissue specificity and regulation of gene expression in higher organisms. It must be sufficiently efficient and accurate to power the long-read sequencing approaches that are used in single- cell RNAseq, particularly when transcript diversification is monitored as a function of time. The first two aims of the proposal are focused on high-throughput detection of RNA modifications (such as 2-O-methyl groups and N7-methyl guanosines). In the first aim, a unique MarathonRT primer extension protocol will be combined with a trained mutational profiling algorithm to recognize the positions and chemical identities of specific RNA modifications, reporting a modification signature that can be recognized at high throughput during long-read sequencing (MRT-ModSeq). In the second aim, MRT-ModSeq will be tested on unknown RNAs, where it will be used to predict sites of modifications on challenging long transcripts and robustness of the predictions will be directly evaluated using mass spectrometry. The second half of the proposal is focused on identification of linked alternative splicing and editing sites on long transcripts within complex cellular mixtures. In aim 3, MarathonRT will be incorporated into a workflow for accurately profiling the relative abundance and processing diversity of the highly complex paralytic (para) gene, which encodes more than 1 million possible processing variants, a subset of which are essential for the voltage-gating of a sodium channel. This sets the stage for Aim 4, in which sensitivity of the workflow must be further optimized and merged with data analysis strategies suitable for time-resolved single cell applications. The resulting method will be tested by monitoring full-length transcriptomic signatures induced by cell stress. Project Narrative Relevance: A single DNA gene produces many different RNA molecules that differ in size and composition, and each of them plays a distinct role in cellular function and the life of an organism. We are creating new RNA sequencing methods that will enable us to monitor all of these isoforms individually, making it possible to determine their specific roles in human health and disease",High-throughput detection of transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic variation and kinetics using MarathonRT,10276105,R01HG011868,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Digestion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Doxorubicin ', ' 14-Hydroxydaunomycin ', ' Adriamycine ', ' Doxorubicina ', ' Hydroxyl Daunorubicin ', ' Hydroxyldaunorubicin ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Guanosine ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Ions ', ' Kinetics ', ' Medicine ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Pseudouridine ', ' RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' EC 2.7.7.49 ', ' RNA Transcriptase ', ' RNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase ', ' Reverse Transcriptase ', ' Revertase ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Post-Transcriptional RNA Processing ', ' Post-Transcriptional RNA Modification ', ' Posttranscriptional RNA Processing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Transfer RNA ', ' Triplet Codon-Amino Acid Adaptor ', ' tRNA ', ' transfer Ribonucleic acids ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sodium Channel ', ' Sodium Ion Channels ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thiouridine ', ' 4-Thiouridine ', ' 4-thio-uridine ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' RNase P ', ' Ribonuclease P ', ' Catalytic RNA ', ' Ribozymes ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' cofactor ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Heat-Shock Response ', ' Heat Shock ', ' Heat-Shock Reaction ', ' Metabolic ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' interest ', ' methyl group ', ' nuclease ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' voltage ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cDNA Library ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' RNA synthesis ', ' RNA chemical synthesis ', ' Length ', ' Detection ', ' Primer Extension ', ' Cell Cycle Kinetics ', ' Cell Kinetics ', ' Cellular Stress ', ' cell stress ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' sequencing platform ', ' reference genome ', ' reference assembly ', ' preservation ', ' epitranscriptomics ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' computational suite ', ' implementation facilitation ', ' ']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1005089,CT-03
"Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals PROJECT SUMMARY The transmission or ‘spillover’ of wildlife viruses to humans is a critical threat to global health, with outbreaks of viral pathogens like filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses all originating in wild mammals. A key outstanding question is whether specific taxonomic groups, such as bats, warrant extra surveillance as ‘special reservoirs’ of viruses that are potentially pathogenic to humans. However, existing host-virus datasets are not sufficiently resolved to predict fine-grain risk for species or genera. An effective response must therefore address two core aims: (i) synthesizing knowledge regarding virus-to-mammal interactions; and (ii) using that knowledgebase to robustly predict future spillover events (i.e., zoonotic risk). To enable robust analysis and reusability of public datasets of NIAID’s Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC; especially NCBI Virus and Virus Pathogen Resources, ViPR), the project will develop Host-Virus Data Intelligence to address three main problems for data reuse: confidence of the taxonomic assignments of mammals and viruses in observations; confidence in the evidence for proposed mammal-virus interactions; and connecting all the relevant data in published texts that are hidden from existing databases. The project team will construct a novel bioinformatic pipeline that will digitally connect taxonomic knowledge, use it to search dark data to find evidence of potential host-virus interactions, and then link it together using metadata layers (‘data about the data’) to form a more expansive host-virus knowledge graph than previously feasible. The project’s computational approach leverages information extraction methods in natural language processing as well as novel applications of artificial intelligence methods such as probabilistic inductive logic programming. A key anticipated outcome is to expand the dataset of host-virus interactions by 3-fold compared to comprehensive existing datasets. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a new generation of work reusing host-virus interaction data to test previously inaccessible hypotheses about how species’ traits impact viral spillover to humans. Shifting the paradigm to graph-based analyses, compared to purely taxonomic representations of host-virus interactions, will allow researchers to directly investigate the impact of ecosystem structure and human encroachment upon viral loads. Determining whether all mammals have equal risk of viral spillover, or whether some groups have higher taxon-specific zoonotic risk (e.g., horseshoe bats, murid rodents), is critical information for public health workers and epidemiologists. More definitive risk quantification will also help researchers identify which ecophysiological adaptations predispose certain groups to tolerating more viruses, which may in turn lead to clinical treatments by modeling the immune responses of wild mammals. Filling the identified gaps in host-virus knowledge is therefore essential to aid the progress of zoonotic disease research in the wake of COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synthesizing scientific data about mammal-to-virus interactions is essential to predicting the risk of future events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The project overcomes major obstacles to full and accurate reuse of existing mammal-virus data by applying computational methods for unifying relevant but disconnected data from published sources. Anticipated results will triple available knowledge, opening the door for asking whether some mammals carry more viruses than others and why with unprecedented levels of precision.",Intelligently

"Cell free RNA liquid biopsies ABSTRACT The ultimate goal of this proposal is to verify an RNA liquid biopsy platform and transition it to have specific utility for the study, and non-invasive assessment, of the hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) niche. In addition to their reliance of material excreted from dying, diseased cells, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) platforms are limited to primarily detecting changes in somatic genomic sequence, copy number, or methylation status. Many biological and clinical events, such as hematopoiesis, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis, are executed via global changes in transcriptional regulation. My PhD advisor Dr. Daniel Kim and I have established a platform for exRNA liquid biopsy in human blood-plasma that has demonstrated significant diagnostic and monitoring potential in both Pancreatic cancer and COVID-19 patients. I propose to continue this research to complete my PhD by assessing diagnostic performance of the exRNA platform in a new cohort of 60 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with matched controls. Furthermore, I will apply my expertise in exRNA liquid biopsies to assay the transcriptional dynamics of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) niche. Currently, bone marrow biopsies or aspirations are used to determine bone marrow health and production. These techniques are costly and require sedation and/or pain relief for the subject and have the potential to lead to long term discomfort, infection, excessive bleeding, and other side-effects. BM aspirations remain a critical diagnostic and monitoring tool for HSC transplant recovery, leukemias and lymphomas, blood cell pathologies, and infections of unknown origin but the primary readout remains identification and counting of cell types. I hypothesize that hematopoietic lineages within the BM secrete exRNA that reflect cell state and identity that can be used in a non-invasive RNA liquid biopsy for detailed study of transcription and populations within the BM. I propose to identify exRNA expressed and secreted by HSCs and the remaining hematopoietic lineage in order to develop a platform to deconvolute peripheral blood into constituent hematopoietic cell types without the need for HSC mobilization. NARRATIVE Liquid biopsies are poised to revolutionize diagnostic procedures by making them more accessible and less invasive due to the use of biofluids like blood rather than tissue samples. During my PhD I have helped develop an RNA liquid biopsy platform that the F99 will enable me to lead a validation for in patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. As an NIDDK K00 fellow, I will expand the RNA liquid biopsy platform into a hematological context that will identify extracellular RNA markers of the hematopoietic lineage in- and ex-vivo.",Cell free

"Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage Project Summary / Abstract In the hours after learning, the activation of gene expression follows a specific pattern, producing transient waves of expression needed for long-term memory consolidation. These changes require non-genetic (i.e., “epigenetic”) events, including modifications to: DNA-organizing proteins known as histones, the DNA itself, and the accessibility of DNA to proteins. Additionally, the molecular changes necessary for memory require a form of RNA-based regulation. In the absence of such changes, the long-lasting regulation of gene expression during memory storage fails, and this could account for defects in memory that accompany many psychiatric disorders. Our long-term goal is to define novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying memory storage and synaptic plasticity by taking advantage of recent advances in our understanding of histone modifications, in the development of single-cell RNA technology, and in the function of regulatory mechanisms mediated by small noncoding RNAs. During the previous funding period, we defined a novel metabolic source of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus and have obtained preliminary data about new forms of histone acylation and crotonylation associated with spatial learning. We also developed bioinformatic tools to analyze single nuclear RNA sequencing data to identify neurons activated by learning. We further established the reversal of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mRNA silencing as a novel epigenetic means of regulating activity-dependent translation, linking synaptic activity to translational upregulation of key memory-related targets. These major findings provide the basis of our proposed experiments that we believe will define the next frontiers in our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the impact of a novel histone modification, histone crotonylation, on the epigenetic landscape and gene expression during memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 2, we will define cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the hippocampal neurons during memory consolidation and retrieval. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the microRNA- dependent mechanisms that regulate long-term memory and synaptic plasticity driven by a microRNA processing complex. An understanding of these key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the consolidation and storage of long-term memories is expected to ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Project Narrative The regulation of specific genes critical to the storage of memories (“memory consolidation”) and changes in neuronal function (“plasticity”) vital for learning are controlled by a number of mechanisms that are not themselves regulated by genetics. We propose to determine the functional roles of such epigenetic processes in memory consolidation and plasticity, and to define the sets of genes that are activated, in individual cells, during memory consolidation. This research promises to provide information that will be critical to the development of novel therapeutics capable of alleviating the cognitive deficits underlying many psychiatric disorders.",Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage,10211384,R01MH087463,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A ', ' Acetyl CoA ', ' S-acetate Coenzyme A ', ' Acetylation ', ' Acyl Coenzyme A ', ' Acyl CoA ', ' Fatty Acyl CoA ', ' Long-Chain Acyl CoA ', ' Acylation ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Coenzyme A ', ' CoA ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Histones ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleases ', ' RNA Nucleases ', ' RNase ', ' Ribonuclease Family Protein ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Nuclear RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' longterm memory ', ' long term memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' histone modification ', ' Histone Acetylation ', ' Defect ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Seminal ', ' Translational Regulation ', ' Translational Repression ', ' Translational Inhibition ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' frontier ', ' Translational Derepression ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' transcriptomics ', ' combinatorial ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' memory consolidation ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,740506,IA-02
"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,10210409,R35GM133562,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Nuclear ', ' ES cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' Property ', ' B lymphocyte differentiation ', ' B cell differentiation ', ' histone modification ', ' DNA Modification ', ' DNA Modification Process ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' learning network ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2021,472500,ME-02
"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity

"Robust identification and accurate quantification of RNA transcripts on a system wide scale Contact PD/PI: Li, Jingyi Project Summary Next-generation, Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is by far the most widely used assay for investigating animal transcriptomes, and numerous public RNA-seq data sets have been generated for various biological conditions in multiple species. However, there remain several barriers in using short RNA-seq reads to accurately identify the splicing structures and quantify the abundances of full-length RNA transcripts. In this proposal, we will develop a series of novel statistical and computational methods to improve the robustness of transcript identification and the accuracy of transcript quantification from Illumina RNA-seq data. (Aim 1) We will develop a novel screening method to construct transcript candidates by first detecting sparse splicing structures from multiple RNA-seq data sets for a given biological condition. These transcript candidates will significantly reduce the search space of downstream transcript identification methods and hence improve their precision. (Aim 2) We will develop a robust transcript identification method to identify novel transcripts in a conservative manner from RNA-seq data given existing annotations. Our method will be based on statistical model selection under the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, which will allow users to control the false positive rate of our identified novel transcripts under any given threshold with high probability. (Aim 3) We will develop an accurate transcript quantification method to effectively leverage multiple RNA-seq data sets and to simultaneously assess the data quality based on low-throughput gold standards and cross-data similarities. All of these methods will be first used to study transcripts in mouse macrophage, for which gold standard qPCR and full length cDNA sequences will be generated for training and method validation. The methods will then be more broadly tested in other biological systems where suitable gold standard data is available. Our methods and software will significantly facilitate the use of Illumina RNA-seq data for gene expression studies at the transcript level, increase reproducibility of scientific discoveries from transcriptomic studies, and improve our understanding of gene expression mechanisms in various biological conditions.

"Social Factors, Epigenomics, and Lupus in African American women (SELA) ABSTRACT Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) is a prototypic autoimmune disease marked by a disproportionate prevalence and severity burden in women of African ancestry (AA). There is a critical need for efforts that identify the molecular mechanisms through which positive and negative social determinants of health contribute to the lupus health disparity, so that progress in improving disease outcomes can be made and the health disparities gap can be closed. This research project addresses the objectives of PAR-19-372 to “1) advance understanding of mechanisms by which social factors lead to epigenetic changes that affect minority health and health disparities, and 2) promote epigenetics research to better predict disease or resiliency among health disparity populations.” We are seeking to identify and characterize the epigenetic mechanisms by which positive and negative social experiences affect gene function and thereby influence SLE in AA women. We have previously shown that racial discrimination is associated with worse disease outcomes in AA women, while social support seems to have a positive impact. Multiple environmental exposures, including psychosocial factors, affect variation in DNA methylation. Despite their influence on SLE in AA women, it is not known how environmental experiences affect and operate through the individual epigenome to influence disease. We will test the following hypotheses in AA women: 1) exposure to adverse and protective social contexts is associated with epigenomic changes involving immune, inflammatory, and energy metabolism pathways, which in turn are associated with disease outcomes; and 2) social support compensates for the detrimental, independent effect of racial discrimination on SLE through epigenetic and gene regulatory mechanisms. We will leverage our existing registry and infrastructure, together with our community partnership, to accomplish this community-engaged integrative mechanistic study. We will enroll 300 AA women with SLE and 300 unaffected AA women, collect sociodemographic, medical, genotypic, leukocyte proportion, DNA methylation, and gene expression data, and use validated measures to assess life course racial discrimination and social support. We propose to: identify variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with (a) exposure to racial discrimination, (b) exposure to social support, and (c) epigenetic age acceleration (Aim 1); to assess whether social DNAm sites affect gene expression (Aim 2); and identify the synergistic effects of social factors on DNAm changes on SLE and develop a social factors-DNAm predictive model for disease outcomes (Aim 3). This will be the first study investigating epigenetic mechanisms by which risk and resiliency factors affect gene function and lupus in AA women. These results will greatly expand the knowledge of how social factors affect gene function, disease outcomes, and health disparities, which might inform the development of effective interventions to close the health disparities gap. Finally, given the shared etiologic mechanisms, these findings have broader applicability to other autoimmune diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies, disproportionately affecting women and African Americans, with whom it is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, and without safe and effective treatments. This project seeks to identify and characterize the epigenetic mechanisms by which positive and negative social experiences affect gene function and thereby influence SLE in African American women. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it could lead to improvements in our understanding of the etiology of SLE and its disparities, facilitating the development of targeted precision medicine approaches to reduce morbidity, mortality, and close the health disparities gap.","Social Factors, Epigenomics, and Lupus in African American women (SELA)",10299857,R01MD015395,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' White Cell ', ' white blood cell ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity -

"Computational Methods for Designing Optimal Genomics-guided Viral Diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract Viral genome sequencing is growing exponentially and cutting-edge molecular technologies, guided by genomic data, show great promise in detecting and responding to viruses. Yet we lack a computational framework that efficiently leverages viral data to design the nucleic or amino acid sequences applied by these technologies. The proposal provides a career development plan to (i) build computational techniques — algorithms, models, and software — that yield highly accurate diagnostic assays, with potential to outperform existing ones, and (ii) use the techniques to proactively design assays for detecting 1,000s of viruses. The project will first develop methods for designing optimal viral genome-informed diagnostics. The study will formulate objective functions that evaluate an assay’s performance across a distribution of anticipated viral targets. Combinatorial optimization algorithms and generative models, constructed in the study, will optimize the functions. The project will also develop datasets for training predictive models of assay performance, which are used in the objective functions, focusing on CRISPR-, amplification-, and antigen-based diagnostics. Preliminary experimental results suggest such models can render assays with exquisite sensitivity and specificity. The study will compare the algorithmically-designed assays to state-of-the-art tests for four viruses. With these methods, the project will design diagnostic assays that are species-specific and broadly effective across genomic diversity for all viruses known to infect vertebrates. The study will build a system to monitor the assays’ effectiveness against emerging viral genomic diversity and to continually update them as needed. To enable the broad adoption of these methods, the project will implement them efficiently in accessible software. The proposal aligns with a NIAID goal of improving diagnostics via data science. The methods developed here may also aid therapy and vaccine design, and will leave the world better prepared to combat viral outbreaks. The career development award will provide training for the candidate in applied areas of long-term interest to his career. The candidate has previous experience in developing computational methods and analyzing viral genomes. Through the award, he will gain new knowledge and skills in diagnostic applications, alongside formal and informal training in immunology, bioengineering, and related laboratory techniques. This training will help the candidate progress toward therapy and vaccine applications that could benefit from advanced computational methods. The Broad Institute provides a supportive environment for the candidate’s development, including career development workshops, research seminars aligned with the proposed plan, and opportunities to initiate collaborations with scientists having expertise complementary to the candidate’s. The research and training will help him form an independent research group focused on developing and applying computational methods to enable more effective microbial surveillance and response. Project Narrative Viral genomic data is reshaping how we prepare for and respond to viral threats, but there is a scarcity of computational techniques that harness this vast, ever-growing data for designing diagnostic assays. The project will develop and test algorithms, machine learning models, and software systems to efficiently design highly accurate diagnostic assays by optimizing well-defined objective functions, applied to multiple diagnostic technologies, and will build a resource of broadly effective diagnostic assays for 1,000s of viral species.

"Mechanism-based Targeting of the RNA Processing Machinery of SARS-CoV-2 ABSTRACT The massive global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality makes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) one of the deadliest viruses in recent history. It is especially noteworthy for hijacking the normal operations of human cells. To develop effective therapies, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS-CoV-2 encodes the non-structural protein (nsp)16/nsp10 protein complex that transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to 2’-OH of the first transcribing nucleotide of the viral mRNA and thus converts the Cap-0 (m7GpppA) to Cap-1 (m7GpppAm). The resulting viral mRNA mimics host cell’s mRNA. In this way, a cell cannot distinguish between its own RNA and that of the virus. This modification of the virally encoded mRNA not only tricks the immune system and helps the virus to take over the host translation machinery for synthesis of its own proteins for survival and propagation. Ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to viral infection and limit pathogenesis. Our recent paper in Nature Communications described atomic level details of the nsp16/nsp10 complex and how the enzyme is well adapted to bind the RNA cap and exert the 2’-OH methylation. We also discovered a distant pocket (located 25Å away from the catalytic center) in nsp16 that is unique to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that this pocket in nsp16 is partially composed of amino acids that are unique to SARS-CoV-2. It can bind small molecules outside of the catalytic center. We propose to build a long- term research program aimed at deciphering the factors crucial to the maintenance of RNA genome and evasion from the host’s immune response. Our studies will reveal basic principles underlying SARS-CoV-2 RNA cap modification, the mode of nucleoprotein (NP) assembly, interplay with mRNA, and new approaches for therapeutic targeting. In Aim 1, we will resolve a series of new structures of nsp16/nsp10 proteins captured in every step of the methyl transfer by X-ray crystallography. The structural data will be validated by detailed biochemical and biophysical studies. We will resolve the biochemical and structural determinants of the assembly of viral RNA capping machinery, and identify factors underlying integrity of RNA genome. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel molecular tool to study temporal distribution of the RNA methylation during viral infection. We will examine new models for combinatorial inhibition of viral proteins by drug repurposing or novel small molecules. Finally, we will use our recently established reverse genetics approaches based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV2 containing mutations in nsp16 to determine their contribution in viral replication in cultured cells and pathogenesis in vivo using our recently described K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NARRATIVE The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can hijack the normal operations of human cells, which makes it especially dangerous. It encodes a set of nonstructural proteins (nsp) to protect its RNA genome from host degradation and immune restriction. Our studies will combine biochemical, structural, cellular, and genomic approaches to address fundamental questions related to RNA modification, host immune restriction, viral growth and pathogenesis, and develop new molecular tools to collectively inform new COVID- 19 treatments and protect ourselves against future coronaviral infections.",Mechanism-based Targeting of the RNA Processing Machinery

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression,10321686,R01AR076440,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Joints ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Hip Osteoarthritis ', ' Coxarthrosis ', ' hip OA ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' sodium bisulfite ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' PBMC ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' novel ', ' economic impact ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' model development ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' joint function ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' deep sequencing ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' FDA approved ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenome ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' methylation pattern ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' targeted sequencing ', ' biomarker development ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' subchondral bone ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' algorithm development ', ' DNA methylation profiling ', ' Methyl-Seq ', ' MethylSeq ', ' Methylation sequencing ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIAMS,OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R01,2021,373023,OK-05
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm. Interestingly, I have developed new tools to study the controllers mediating this essential transfer of information. The objective of this work is to discover all the regulators and the ways they interact one with each other to generate a fully-grown organism because it will ultimately help to understand human

"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,10107766,R01AR045192,"['Dependovirus ', ' Adeno-Associated Viruses ', ' Dependoparvovirus ', ' adeno associated virus group ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Atopic Dermatitis ', ' Atopic Eczema ', ' Atopic Neurodermatitis ', ' Disseminated Neurodermatitis ', ' allergic dermatitis ', ' allergic eczema ', ' Diploidy ', ' Diploid ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Epidermis ', ' Future ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Ichthyoses ', ' keratinocyte ', ' Kinetics ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Proteins ', ' Psoriasis ', ' psoriasiform ', ' psoriatic ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' skin disorder ', ' Cutaneous Disorder ', ' Dermatoses ', ' Skin Diseases ', ' Skin Diseases and Manifestations ', ' cutaneous disease ', ' dermal disease ', ' dermal disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Generations ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Skin Carcinoma ', ' skin squamous cell carcinoma ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' cutaneous tissue ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Genomics ', ' gene induction ', ' Skin ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' keratinocyte differentiation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' human disease ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' skin barrier ', ' cutaneous barrier ', ' dermal barrier ', ' epidermal barrier ', ' Knock-in ', ' knockin ', ' recruit ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,459691,CA-18
"A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition Abstract Drug metabolism and disposition are essential xenobiotic responses. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not have protein-coding potentials. Although many of the biological functions of lncRNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how lncRNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance. Through integrative analysis of cancer non-coding genomic and high-through drug screening data of 505 cancer cell lines, our preliminary study have discovered and functionally characterized a group of ADME(drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, whose up-regulation is associated with resistance to more than 100 chemotherapy compounds and may regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters through interacting with xenobiotic nuclear receptor. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs is an important contributor for the development of cancer chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: In Aim 1, we will perform bioinformatic analysis and molecularly clone of lncRNAs associated with cancer chemo-resistance and clinical prognosis. In Aim 2: we will functional characterize of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, using in vivo and in vitro cancer chemotherapy models. In Aim 3: we will determine the mechanism by which ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Chemotherapy remains a mainstay in the clinical management of cancer patients, but chemo-resistance is a major challenge to overcome. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor- mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the development of chemo-resistance. Narrative The goal of this study is to reveal a novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that a group of novel lncRNAs, identified by our computational analysis and experimental validation, can affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs.

"Specialized RNA analysis center for integrative genomic analyses ABSTRACT Projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have generated a tremendous amount of data characterizing the genomic events in cancer and highlighting the deep complexity and significant heterogeneity that can make precision medicine challenging. Molecular subtyping has helped to identify groups of samples with shared genomic characteristics that can be used for clinical decisions. RNA expression has played a strong role in molecular subtyping over the last twenty years. Integration of RNA expression data with other data types that are being generated as part of the Genome Data Analysis Network have improved our knowledge of tumorigenesis and separating driving events from passenger events. Our team has over a 20 year history of innovation in expression technologies, innovating across generations of assays and projects. We propose to apply our knowledge, experience, and methods to address the projects that will be addressed in this cooperative agreement including clinical trial samples from ALCHEMIST or the Clinical Trials Sequencing Program. We propose to address four specific areas of research including `expression/mRNA analysis', `Spatial genomics data analysis', `data integration', and “clinical outcomes.” We will provide 1) analysis of RNA sequencing and expression data, 2) normalization and analysis methods of spatial transcriptomics data, 3) integrative genomic approaches for cancer classification and characterization, and 4) analysis of biomarkers for association with clinical and other molecular features.

"miR-92a as a biomarker of diabetic retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a global problem due to an alarming increase in the number of individuals with diabetes. The lack of an early diagnostic tool predicting retinal vascular health is a critical barrier to progress. To this end, we have identified circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) as ideal reporter cells, which are most receptive to changes of diabetic milieu and retinopathy. Our preliminary studies suggest that CACs map a distinct RNA signature. We also found that a miRNA, miR-92a, is downregulated explicitly in CACs with DR, and its overexpression in CACs of people with diabetes decreased pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-1β and CD14, emphasizing the importance of CACs for biomarker discovery of retinal vascular health. Our preliminary studies using machine learning models could accurately predict DR providing us a stronger rationale for developing this paradigm for our robust study design. Furthermore, using rodent models, we found a decrease in miR-92a in lineage-Sca1+c-kit+ (LSK; mouse equivalent of CACs) parallels with an increase in acellular capillaries, and miR- 92a inhibition in LSKs triggered a stronger inflammatory response. Therefore, this proposal's overarching goal is to study RNA (miRNA and mRNA) and inflammatory signature using a robust sequencing paradigm and differential modeling in individuals with different severities of DR and animal models to gain insights into retinal vascular health. Our central hypothesis is that RNA signature in CACs mirror DR severity, and miR-92a decrease within CACs serves as a candidate biomarker. We propose the following specific aims to test our hypothesis: Aim 1: To assess changes in RNA levels in CACs of patients with different severity of DR and validate miR-92a as a candidate biomarker. Aim 2: Determine whether the miR-92a loss in bone marrow cells is associated with the development of DR in rodents. We anticipate that our proposed studies will identify specific mRNA and miRNA changes of DR severity and validate miR-92a as a novel biomarker for retinal vascular health. Overall, our studies will help improve the standard of care of DR individuals by aiding in diagnosis, prognosis and providing mechanistic insights for future therapies. While diabetic retinopathy (DR) cases are rising globally, and newer treatments are emerging, there is a lack of biomarkers reflecting retinal vascular health. We propose that the RNA levels (mRNA and miRNA) and inflammation in circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) will serve as a biomarker of DR. We will perform RNA sequencing of CACs in DR patients and study how a change in miRNA levels leads to retinopathy using rodent models.",miR-92a as a biomarker of diabetic

"Investigating virus-host interactions with prime editing and genetic code expansion PROJECT SUMMARY Host proteins play essential roles in the replication of all viruses. This represents a vulnerability that could potentially be exploited to develop interventions against viruses currently circulating in humans as well as new and emerging viral threats. However, realizing this potential requires mechanistic understanding of how specific host factors function during viral infection. This proposal will develop a versatile screening methodology to investigate the mechanisms through which host proteins enhance virus replication. This will be achieved using recent developments in genome engineering and chemical biology that enable site-specific modification of host factors with unnatural amino acids. By genetically re-coding >100 host proteins implicated in the replication of influenza A virus (IAV), we will investigate (1) the effects of depleting specific host factors on virus replication and the subcellular localization of viral proteins; (2) the effects of viral infection on the expression and subcellular localization of host proteins; and (3) the effects of host factor depletion on the assembly and morphogenesis of new virus particles. If successful, this project will provide insight into the host dependency of IAV and establish a resource for investigating host protein function in the replication of additional, evolutionarily-divergent respiratory viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Therapeutic interventions that can prevent or control emerging viral infections are urgently needed. One approach to developing these interventions is to target proteins from the host that function to enhance viral infection, rather than targeting the virus directly.

"AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma PROJECT SUMMARY Drug discovery is a laborious, time-consuming, and expensive undertaking for biopharma. Oncology is especially difficult with new drugs in clinical trials having just 3.4% probability of success. This application addresses significant challenges of traditional drug target discovery in oncology that relies on cell viability or reporter assays which oversimplifies cell state. New advancements in single-cell RNA expression profiling allows us to overcome these challenges by quantitatively mapping transcriptional dependencies in cancer cells and rapidly probing vulnerabilities to reprogram the oncogenic signaling networks. Transcription factors MYCN and MYC are to date non-druggable by small molecules despite being high value cancer drug targets as they are frequently amplified genes and drive poor outcome across the cancer spectrum. Agents that block MYCN indirectly identified from synthetic lethal viability screens have resulted in only modest or short-lived responses in ongoing clinical trials. Algen’s proprietary machine learning platform (AlgenML) identifies targets that block oncogenic transcription addiction on MYCN using single-cell RNA expression of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) gene knockdown. Genome-wide single-cell RNA expression profiling measures 10,000 genes per cell and each high- throughput assay routinely captures 160,000 cells at once. Using CRISPRi gene knockdown libraries and multiplexing the assays, hundreds of genes can be knocked down simultaneously and we single-cell RNA sequence 200 cells per CRISPRi gene knockdown. This makes for an extremely rich data set with over 400 million data points of RNA expression data which AlgenML analyzes. Our drug discovery approach is innovative because, unlike traditional approaches, the AlgenML platform does not identify essential genes that cause cell death, but rather selects drug targets in an unbiased manner whose suppression can reprogram the disease- related transcriptional dependencies. Resulting drugs should be safer and better tolerated. Here, our approach is to optimize AlgenML to monitor and reprogram MYCN transcriptional activity in new genetically defined models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. We focus on neuroblastoma because MYCN amplifications are common in the disease, and the genetically defined models allow detection of the precise contribution of MYCN oncogene compared to isogenic controls. In Aim 1, we define MYCN transcriptional signature, nominate target genes, and test target genes in vitro based on their ability to reprogram the MYCN transcriptional dependency. Aim 2 evaluates in vivo efficacy of target inhibition to shrink tumors and extend lifespan in new human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and rodent models of neuroblastoma from UCSF. Our team of investigators at Algen and UCSF has decades of experience in developing RNA signatures to indirectly targeting MYC and MYCN via synthetic lethality. Mature startup Algen Biotechnologies has a vibrant ecosystem of investors, innovators, and grew out of Nobel Laureate Dr. Jennifer Doudna’s lab at UC Berkeley, who has been a scientific advisor since its founding. With Dr. William Weiss at UCSF, we have assembled a powerhouse environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Algen is developing a drug discovery platform to select and test drug targets that block the oncogenic transcriptional effects of non-druggable drivers such as MYCN. MYC and MYCN transcription factors are directly non-druggable by small molecules, despite being high value targets for drug discovery because their amplifications correlate with extremely poor prognosis across the cancer spectrum. MYCN is amplified in 25% of all neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, and marks high-risk disease with an aggressive phenotype that is resistant to chemotherapy and only a 40-50% 5-year survival rate.",AlgenML: Drug target discovery platform for transcriptional reprogramming of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma,10326006,R41GM146327,"['Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industrialization ', ' Libraries ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neural Crest ', ' Neuroblastoma ', ' Oncogenes ', ' Cancer Genes ', ' Cancer-Promoting Gene ', ' Transforming Genes ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Genetic Suppression ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Malignant -

"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,10224739,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly ', '

"A multi-modality approach to decode epithelial heterogeneity and function in metaplasia 1) Background, key gaps in our understanding, and important challenges to be addressed. In response to injury, differentiated adult secretory cells in the gastrointestinal tract undergo metaplasia, or the conversion of one cell type to another. In the pancreas, this is called `acinar to ductal metaplasia' (ADM) and it is thought to function in tissue regeneration. The goals of our laboratory are to generate tools to understand the process of ADM, to identify the consortium of ADM cell types that emerge, and to determine their physiological role in tissue injury. 2) Description of recent progress by the PI. By the end of her post-doctoral work, the PI showed that differentiated, secretory cell types, such as tuft cells, form in the pancreas in response to ADM (DelGiorno et al. Frontiers in Physiology, 2020). Tuft cells are solitary chemosensory cells with myriad roles in mediating inflammation. Combining RNA sequencing, electron microscopy (EM), and mouse models of disease, she identified a functional role for tuft cells, the first description in any model of tumorigenesis (DelGiorno et al. Gastroenterology, 2020). Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and EM, she has identified the formation of several additional secretory cell populations in ADM of unknown function, which are now being studied in the DelGiorno laboratory. 3) Overview of future research program. We propose to continue our work on ADM by creating a workflow combining Single cell RNA-seq and EM Analysis (SEMA) to study epithelial heterogeneity in pancreatic injury with and without the genetic manipulation of identified cell types. Volumetric electron microscopy (3DEM) will be used as a substrate on which to map the information provided by scRNA-seq to reveal the spatial relationships between cells and infer the function of individual cell types through the study of their organellar content. Our approach leverages scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to conduct a variety of experiments on the same tissue including: [1] imaging of dehydrated whole-mount samples, [2] wide-field “chip mapping” of large areas of ultrathin sections, and [3] large-scale serial section approaches for 3DEM acquisition. Mapping is enhanced using correlative light and electron microscopy to assign molecular markers identified in scRNA-seq by immunofluorescence to cells with defining characteristics in SEM (e.g., nuclear shape, distribution of mitochondria, etc). Our 3DEM datasets are amenable to high-throughput image processing (e.g., segmentation, geometry processing) using machine learning and deep learning tool kits. Together, these tools provide a novel discovery workflow, which will be applied to projects throughout our laboratory aimed at evaluating cellular heterogeneity in ADM. Our goals for the next five years are to use this SEMA approach to build a multi-dimensional atlas of the cellular content and spatial relationships of the various emergent cell types in ADM. Mouse models lacking individual ADM cell subtypes will be used to assess phenotypic effects on cellular makeup, relative positioning, and disease progression. Together, these studies will provide invaluable insight into the role of ADM in tissue healing and regeneration in the pancreas. Technological advances in single cell RNA sequencing platforms have rapidly advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity within complex multicellular organ systems, however validating these data remain a major challenge. Ultrastructural electron microscopy is the gold standard for cell type identification by recognition of definitive physical features, however sample preparation and analysis are arduous and low- throughput. Our laboratory is combining these techniques with deep learning as a novel workflow to predict and confirm epithelial changes in pancreatic metaplasia to understand the processes and mechanisms underlying epithelial injury and regeneration.",A multi-modality approach to decode epithelial heterogeneity and function in metaplasia,10274940,R35GM142709,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Atlases ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' alimentary tract ', ' digestive canal ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Metaplasia ', ' Metaplastic Change ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Scanning Electron Microscopy ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' image processing ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Epithelial ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Pancreatic Injury ', ' Pancreatic Trauma ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Nuclear ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Duct ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Metaplastic Cell ', ' Secretory Cell ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' tissue regeneration ', ' regenerate new tissue ', ' regenerate tissue ', ' regenerating damaged tissue ', ' regenerating tissue ', ' tissue renewal ', ' tissue specific regeneration ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' healing ', ' response to injury ', ' injury response ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' spatial relationship ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Geometry ', ' sequencing platform ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' deep learning ', ' tissue injury ', ' injury to tissue ', ' epithelial injury ', ' pancreatic metaplasia ', ' epithelium regeneration ', ' regenerate epithelium ', ' ']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,396250,TN-05
"Ancient viral threats through the lens of adaptation in human genomes Project Summary The current SARS-COV2 pandemic has brought to light that more efforts are needed to evaluate the pandemic potential of viruses that can spill over in human populations. To assess the pandemic potential of specific viruses, over the next five years my lab will ask if similar viruses caused epidemics not only during the recent documented past, but during the much longer time scale of human evolution. Viruses that caused epidemics in the past are indeed the most likely to cause epidemics again in the future, and hundreds of viral epidemics likely plagued human populations during their evolution. This work will fill gaps in knowledge on epidemics in ancestral human populations, and by doing so, will enable a better assessment of the viruses that represent a future pandemic threat.  To study ancient epidemics, my lab will exploit host genomic adaptation driven by ancient viruses. Arms races with viruses have shaped the host immune system by driving a large number of adaptations. I recently showed that viruses left abundant signals of adaptation not only in immune genes, but across the entire human genome. The lab will examine signals of adaptation left by specific viruses in human genomes, to detect, date, and functionally characterize ancient epidemics. To this aim, we will develop new statistical tools based on recent advances in machine learning and in the reconstruction of Ancestral Recombination Graphs (ARGs). These new approaches with increased power to detect and date genomic adaptation will allow us to ask the following questions: 1) Which viruses drove ancient epidemics in human evolution? My lab will create deep learning tests with high power to detect complex genomic adaptation within the past ~200,000 years of human evolution. 2) When did specific viruses drive ancient epidemics? We will use ARGs and Approximate Bayesian Computation to date ancient epidemics, by dating the host adaptive events driven by specific viruses. 3) Which functional host genetic changes were selected during ancient epidemics, in which genes, and how do they influence genetic susceptibility to present viruses? We will investigate regulatory adaptation to viruses and the overall impact of virus-driven host adaptation on the genetic susceptibility of different human populations to specific present viruses, thereby providing virologists with strong candidate host genes for further inquiry.  My lab is uniquely suited to decipher ancient epidemics by linking host-pathogen interactions together with the latest developments in the population genomics of adaptation. Project narrative Arms races with viruses have shaped human genomic adaptation, not only in immune genes, but also across the entire human genome. Over the coming years, my lab will exploit host genomic adaptation to detect, date, and functionally characterize ancient viral epidemics that plagued ancestral human populations. Because past viral threats are more likely to become threats again in the future, ancient epidemics will provide a better assessment of the viruses with the potential to cause future epidemics.",Ancient viral threats through the lens of adaptation in human genomes,10274677,R35GM142677,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Link ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Viral ', ' Graph ', ' Genomics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' reconstruction ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' arm ', ' deep learning ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R35,2021,377363,AZ-03
"Development of a Predictive Frailty Clock & Longitudinal Investigation of its Epigenetic Determinants Project summary/abstract Longevity studies in mice are expensive and time-consuming, and there are currently no measures that can predict mortality in a mouse at an earlier time-point. Additionally, there are very few measures of the overall health of mice that can be assessed longitudinally. In humans, frailty can predict mortality with greater power than the DNA methylation clock. In my early postdoctoral work I have validated a mouse frailty index, that increases with age, is associated with mortality and age-related pathologies, and is sensitive to interventions. In the Sinclair lab I have used machine learning modelling of this mouse frailty index to make the Analysis of Frailty in Death (AFRAID) clock that can predict the lifespan of male C57BL/6 mice aged 21 months or older with accuracy of approximately 1.7 months. We hypothesis that a frailty clock that includes a range of measures including physiological and molecular measures (blood-based Analysis of Frailty in Death, bAFRAID) will accurately predict lifespan in younger, female mice of a different strain. To test this hypothesis I will complete a battery of health assessments, including blood collection for novel peptide biomarker detection, in male and female UM-HET3 mice every 3 months from 15 months of age until death. I will use regression modelling of all measured outcomes to develop an optimized `bAFRAID clock' that predicts time to death in mice. I will complete this part of the project at Harvard Medical School in the lab of Dr David Sinclair, who will act as my mentor and is an internationally recognised expert in the biology of aging. I will receive additional training in biomarker modelling and peptidomics from experts Drs Steve Horvath and Steve Gygi. For the independent phase of this award, I will use longitudinal assessments, and cutting-edge epigenetic tools to investigate the relationship between epigenetic changes and the AFRAID clock. This will increase our understanding of whether epigenetic mechanisms underly the onset of frailty in aging. The completion of this project and the proposed training will position me in an ideal position to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent researcher with a lab focused on understanding the mechanisms of frailty in aging. Project Narrative This project aims to develop a new tool to assess the overall health of a mouse and predict early in a mouse's life when it will die.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10124273,R44AI145505,"['Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Europe ', ' Evoked Potentials ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Opportunistic Infections ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Paper ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Work ', ' Oligoclonal Bands ', ' Oligoclonal Immunoglobulins ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' disability ', ' Neurologist ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' drug efficacy ', ' cohort ', ' ESTs ', ' Expressed Sequence Tags ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' response ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' health organization ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' human disease ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' brain health ', ' preservation ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' experimental group ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Treatment-related side effects ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' learning classifier ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2021,499995,TN-05
"Utilization of Advanced Technologies for the Understanding of Human Structural Birth Defects PROJECT SUMMARY The unifying theme of this proposal is the aim to use state-of-the-art technologies to investigate the basic biology of mammalian organ development and human structural birth defects. Our approach is wide-ranging, and aims to demonstrate how utilization of powerful technologies can inform many disorders. Importantly, this proposal marries a number of strengths of investigators at Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences; specifically, expertise in the diagnosis and understanding of human congenital malformation syndromes and mammalian developmental biology, and the application of powerful new techniques for biological investigation. In Project 1, we propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq) technology to characterize mid- gestation embryos of mice carrying mutations relevant to human structural birth defects. Essentially, we are proposing to utilize sci-RNA-seq as a phenotype, with which one can annotate changes in expression and cell- type representation during abnormal organogenesis. Ideally, these profiles will be comparable to each other, and can potentially provide insight into fundamental biological pathways that are perturbed when developmentally important genes are lost. In Project 2, we will leverage recent advances in 3D imaging, computer vision and machine-learning to make the morphological characterization of mouse mutants more accurate, quantitative, reproducible and accessible. Progeny from the same lines studied in Project 1 will be harvested at E15.5 and imaged using microCT scanning. We will then employ several different data analysis techniques to identify differences in the tissue volume and shapes in the mutant mice compared to synthetic image constructed from a pool of ‘normative’ samples. The goal of Project 3 is to use novel technologies in prospective cohorts of children with structural birth defects to identify genetic variation not ascertained by current methods. These “hidden” variants include structural rearrangements, as well as DNA mutations that arise post-zygotically and are not present in blood-derived DNA. We will use long-read based DNA and RNA sequencing methods, or deep short-read based DNA sequencing of multiple, non-blood derived tissues, on patients with structural birth defects whose clinical workup has been non-diagnostic.

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes Project Summary Alternative splicing is a key cellular process whose dysregulation has been implicated broadly across human genetic disease. Dr. Knowles previously developed LeafCutter, a flexible, scalable, annotation-free tool to quantify local patterns of RNA splicing from short-read RNA-seq data. While LeafCutter has been quite widely adopted and we have actively maintained it and addressed issues on github, it remains “early stage” software. We propose software engineering improvements: 1) appropriate packaging using conda with standard build, installation, testing and logging processes, 2) containerization using Docker, 3) standardization of input/output data formats/interfaces, and 4) refactoring to use a standard workflow language. These improvements will allow us to distribute LeafCutter through repositories including PyPI, BioConda, DockStore, and Galaxy. Finally improvements to documentation, testing and version management will make contributions to LeafCutter from the open source community more feasible and easier to integrate. The parent award for the proposed work is U01 AG068880-01 “Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes”, where we are developing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models to better understand the genetic basis of AD. This award makes extensive use of LeafCutter. In Aim 1 we are building DL models of pre- and post- transcriptional regulation: for the latter LeafCutter provides training data for our neural network model of the sequence determinants of RNA splicing in AD-relevant cell types and states. In Aim 2 we connect AD-associated structural variation to functional variation, including RNA splicing variation. In Aim 3, we will build trans-expression QTL networks across thousands of post-mortem brain samples: with the improvements to the LeafCutter ecosystem proposed here we will be able to straightforwardly extend to trans splicing QTL networks. While we and our collaborators are ourselves heavy users of LeafCutter, we will continue to ensure we provide for the needs and use-cases of the broader genomics community. Alternative splicing is an important cellular process where “junk” DNA is removed from the gene before it is translated into protein. When this process is disrupted in some way it can cause disease. Here we propose software engineering improvements to software, LeafCutter, we previously developed to better understand splicing patterns from RNA-seq data.",Learning the Regulatory Code of

"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic

"Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states Splicing factors are frequently altered by mutations and copy-number changes both in cancer and in germline genetic diseases resulting in multi-system developmental syndromes. Despite the fact that virtually all genes in humans undergo splicing, spliceosomal genetic alterations tend to exhibit surprisingly specific effects on subsets of splicing events, leaving most insignificantly changed. These effects can be allele-specific, cell-type specific, and dependent on the genetic background of the afflicted cell. This makes it especially challenging to determine which affected splicing events contribute to disease etiology. The fact that a limited set of introns is responsive to any specific splicing factor alteration indicates that introns and their flanking exons have evolved in structure and sequence to confer differential sensitivity to the action of different spliceosome components. This raises a fundamental question: what are the features common to sets of introns that confer this specificity? Using naturally occurring splicing gene mutations, amplifications, and deletions, these perturbations will be modelled in a genetically stable, untransformed, isogenic cell system where it is possible to isolate the effect of a single alteration on the transcriptome and on the binding patterns of the altered protein. These studies will shed light on the mechanisms of normal spliceosome function, and provide insight into which genes and biological pathways affected by splicing dysfunction likely contribute to disease states.  The proposed experiments will employ three distinct methods to model spliceosome perturbations associated with human disease, with a focus on factors that physically or functionally interact with the essential spliceosome protein SF3B1. (Specific Aim 1) Introduction of an allelic series of cancer-associated SF3B1 missense-mutations into isogenic cell lines using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE); (Specific Aim 2) CRISPRa/i-mediated activation or inhibition of transcription to up- or down- regulate splicing factors that are amplified in cancers (PUF60, SF3B4, and U2AF2) and lost in developmental syndromes (PUF60, SF3B4); and (Specific Aim 3) rapid depletion of spliceosomal RNA helicases (DDX39B, DDX46, and DHX16) and their putative co-factors (SUGP1, RBM17, and GPKOW) at the protein level using auxin-inducible degrons. Three distinct methods of RNA sequencing will be used to quantify the changes resulting from these perturbations: poly(A)-selected RNAseq, allele-specific eCLIP, and a novel intron lariat capture sequencing approach. Lastly, we will integrate these genomic data sets into models using deep learning neural networks to interrogate our central hypothesis: the sequence and structure of individual mammalian introns have evolved to confer differential dependence on specific ‘core’ components of the spliceosome, and that mutations, amplifications, and deletions in these core components causal for human disease will uncover intron-centric gene expression regulatory circuits that are controlled though modulation of the abundance or activity of the associated splicing factors in normal cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE The essential spliceosome protein SF3B1 functions as a hub to coordinate the positioning and dynamic rearrangements of numerous RNA and protein splicing factors. SF3B1, as well as many of its interacting cofactors, are frequently mutated, amplified, or deleted in cancers and in developmental syndromes, yet rather than affecting all introns equally, these disease-associated alterations in the core of the spliceosome have different and specific effects on subsets of introns. Understanding the intronic codes that confer sensitivity to these naturally occurring genetic changes will provide insight into the mechanisms of spliceosome function as well as the biological pathways distorted by spliceosome dysfunction that may present new therapeutic vulnerabilities.",Genomics-based approaches to understanding mechanistic alterations of spliceosome function in disease states,10183903,R01GM141544,"['recombinase ', ' RNA Helicase ', ' Mediating ', ' Spliceosomes ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protein Splicing ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' mutant ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Splice Acceptor Sites ', "" 3' Splice Site "", ' Genomics ', ' DNA Helicases ', ' DNA Unwinding Proteins ', ' DNA unwinding enzyme ', ' helicase ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' patched protein ', ' copy number variant ', ' copy number variation ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' Data ', ' Deletion Mutation ', ' Motor ', ' Mutate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' tumor ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' recombinase-mediated cassette exchange ', ' Cre Lox technology ', ' Cre LoxP system ', ' Cre lox recombination system ', ' Cre lox system ', ' Cre recombinase/LoxP technology ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' causal variant ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' gene expression variation ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Auxins ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Catalysis ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Spliced Genes ', ' Gene Splicing ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Poly A ', ' Poly(rA) ', ' polyadenylate ', ' Proteins ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,323400,NY-25
"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) on assay development, testing, and validation for submission to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and timely deployment of these assays for clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Novel approaches to accurately diagnose acute pediatric COVID-19 associated diseases, including the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as well as predict clinical severity and outcomes, are urgently needed.

"Epigenetic mechanisms of sustained transcription across cocaine abstinence PROJECT SUMMARY Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and high vulnerability to relapse even after prolonged abstinence. A major focus of the field of addiction research has therefore been to identify stable, cocaine-induced neuroadaptations occurring in brain reward circuits. Transcriptional changes are known to persist throughout abstinence, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms of such persistence remain elusive. We recently discovered that the transcription factor, Nr4a1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4) represses cocaine reward and seeking behavior. Our preliminary data show that Nr4a1 is a central regulator of cocaine-induced transcription, including target gene expression in late abstinence. The significance of this study is strengthened by the utility of therapeutic agents that regulate Nr4a1 and block mouse cocaine self-administration, underscoring the enormous potential of this basic research program in combating drug addiction. Given that histone posttranslational modifications (hPTMs) confer long-lasting changes in gene expression necessary for stable cellular phenotypes, histone modifications acquired during abstinence may explain how individual genes “remember” prior drug exposure. We have previously found that Nr4a1 regulates hPTMs at individual target genes at late abstinence. This proposal aims to define the mechanism(s) of persistent gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of male and female mice following volitional cocaine self-administration. We apply novel methods for cell-type specific quantification of both chromatin and gene expression in a single sample. We then validate the causal mechanism of Nr4a1 action using epigenetic editing in vivo. At the conclusion of this study we will have defined the cell-type specific mechanism by which Nr4a1 regulates stable gene expression across cocaine abstinence. Beyond this, we will apply machine learning to identify novel regulators of persistent gene expression relevant to cocaine addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE One outstanding question in addiction biology concerns the mechanism by which neurological changes persist long past the cessation of drug taking. The persistent nature of epigenetic modifications may underlie their role in chronic psychiatric diseases, such as addiction and depression. This proposal aims to define the molecular mechanisms by which a key neuronal transcription factor, Nr4a1, leads to long-term change in gene expression that persist across cocaine abstinence.",Epigenetic mechanisms of sustained transcription across cocaine abstinence,10297955,R01DA052465,"['Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cocaine ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Female ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Histones ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methyltransferase ', ' EC 2.1.1 ', ' methylase ', ' transmethylase ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Publishing ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Volition ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Chronic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Nuclear Receptors ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' drug abstinence ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' cell type ', ' attenuation ', ' Cocaine Addiction ', ' Cocaine Dependence ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' Nerve growth factor induced protein I-B ', ' Nurr77 ', ' rat orphan nuclear receptor HMR ', ' rat orphan nuclear receptor NGFIB ', ' rat orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' CARTPT gene ', ' Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript ', ' Abstinence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' neuroadaptation ', ' neural adaptation ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' epigenetic profiling ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPRi ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' cocaine self-administration ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,679084,PA-03
"Developing Machine Learning Models for the Analysis of Splicing Data in Large Heterogeneous Cohorts Abstract Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNASeq) data obtained from large patient cohorts can reveal transcriptomic perturbations that are associated with complex disease and facilitate the identification of disease subtypes. This is typically framed as an unsupervised learning task to discover latent structure in a matrix of RNASeq based quantification of gene expression or local splicing variations (LSVs). However, several factors make analysis of such heterogeneous data challenging. First, such datasets are comprised of samples processed at multiple institutions which might employ different sequencing protocols and quality control steps. This introduces confounding factors into the data like inconsistent sample quality or variable cell type proportions which can hinder detection of true biological signal. Second, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations in splice factor genes occurring in a subset of the patients may only result in alteration of a subset of coregulated splicing events. Thus, instead of measuring global similarity between samples based on all transcriptomic features, there is a need to efficiently identify “tiles”, defined by a subset of samples and splicing events with abnormal signals. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this task, they fail to overcome many of the computational challenges associated with modeling splicing data and are not well suited to handle missing values. To facilitate analysis of heterogeneous splicing datasets by reducing false positive discoveries and boosting true biological signal, we will first develop a model to correct for the effects of RNA degradation and cell type mixtures. Then in order to efficiently identify AML subtypes characterized by splicing events and account for splicing specific modeling challenges, we propose CHESSBOARD (Characterizing Heterogeneity of Expression and Splicing by Search for Blocks of Abnormalities and Outliers in RNA Datasets), a non- parametric Bayesian model for unsupervised discovery of tiles. We will apply our models to synthetic datasets and show it outperforms several baseline approaches. Next, we will show that it recovers tiles characterized by known and novel splicing aberrations which are reproducible in multiple AML patient cohorts. Finally, we will show that tiles discovered are correlated with drug response to therapeutics, pointing to the translational impact of our findings. Project Narrative: Analysis of RNA-Seq data from large patient cohorts can reveal novel biological signatures that are pivotal to advancing precision medicine, especially for the treatment of heterogeneous hematologic malignancies. However, there is a lack of computational tools to achieve this. This project will develop methods for removing the cofounding factor effects from large heterogeneous splicing datasets and improving subtype identification through multiomics integration to enable such analysis.",Developing Machine Learning Models for the Analysis of Splicing Data in Large Heterogeneous Cohorts,10315802,F31CA265218,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' leukemia ', ' B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute B-Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' B-ALL ', ' B-Cell  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' Pre-B-Cell Leukemia ', ' Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10265790,U19AI135972,"['Animals ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', '

"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,10168450,F31HG010999,"['Adenosine ', ' adenosine deaminase ', ' Adenosine Aminohydrolase ', ' Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Atlases ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Breast ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Codon Nucleotides ', ' Codon ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Exons ', ' Guanosine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inosine ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' premRNA ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Permeability ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Lung Adenocarcinoma ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' RNA Editing ', ' RNA, Messenger, Editing ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Poly(A) Tail ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' tool ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' success ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' RT-PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' RNA Processing ', ' Polymerase ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' cost ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' functional outcomes ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' cost effective ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2021,38613,CA-20
"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,10134401,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biology ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' HDAC ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' Mucus ', ' mucous ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ', ' CFTR ', ' CFTR Protein ', ' cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' success ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' Cell surface ', ' Proteome ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' HDAC7 ', ' mHDAC7 ', ' HDAC7 histone deacetylase ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Deacetylation ', ' HDAC Agent ', ' HDAC inhibitor ', ' Histone deacetylase inhibition ', ' Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' cystic fibrosis patients ', ' CF patients ', ' individuals with CF ', ' individuals with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with CF ', ' patients with cystic fibrosis ', ' Population ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' loss of function ', ' spatial relationship ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' phenome ', ' phenomics ', ' epigenome ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' epigenetic profiling ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' genomic platform ', ' healthspan ', ' health-span ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' ']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,483750,CA-49
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,10130561,R35GM131845,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Caenorhabditis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Dosage Compensation (Genetics) ', ' Dosage Compensation ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Switch Genes ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hermaphroditism ', ' Intersexuality ', ' Histones ', ' male ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Meiosis ', ' meiotic ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Nematoda ', ' Nematodes ', ' roundworm ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Work ', ' X Chromosome ', ' X Inactivation ', ' Lyonization ', ' X-Chromosome Inactivation ', ' Mediating ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' dosage ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' autosome ', ' Structure ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' single molecule ', ' condensin ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' sex determination ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' Mitotic ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromosome Territory ', ' Chromosomal Territory ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' histone demethylase ', ' recruit ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2021,466290,CA-13
"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point.

"Critical role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells The goal of this proposal is to study the role of transcription factor TCF-1 in determining the epigenetic identity of memory CD8+ T cells. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection. A better understanding of memory T cell differentiation is crucial for developing strategies to limit T cell responses in organ transplantation or enhance T cell responses during chronic infections. Although it is known that the transcription factor TCF-1 is required for memory CD8+ T cell function, the mechanisms through which this protein controls memory T cell fate remain unclear. Recently, we discovered that a mechanism through which TCF-1 controls the development of T cells relates to its unprecedented ability to create the chromatin accessibility landscape of naïve T cells. We found that TCF-1 is selectively enriched at genomic regions that become accessible at the earliest stages of development and is required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements. At the single-cell level, TCF-1 can dictate a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells. Moreover, ectopic TCF-1 can directly erase repressive chromatin marks in non-T cells, generating de novo open chromatin and inducing the expression of T cell genes. While our recent data determined the novel role of TCF-1 on the epigenome during T cell development, our findings also raised another critical question: what is the role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells? We hypothesize that TCF-1 in cooperation with transcription factor partners defines the epigenetic landscape of memory T cells. Our new preliminary data further indicate that TCF-1 expression post T cell activation in vitro can lead to gains in chromatin accessibility at pro-memory genes. However, it remains unclear if TCF-1 expression in T cells responding to an infection can create the epigenetic identity of memory T cells. The domains of TCF-1 required for targeting the chromatin and its potential cooperating factors also remain unknown. How TCF-1 dependent changes on the epigenome relate to pro-memory genes needs to be defined. To answer these questions, we will interrogate the effect of TCF-1 and its potential partners on the chromatin state and accessibility of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Using the state-of-the-art tools, we will generate the map of TCF-1 dependent 3D genome organization and define how changes on the epigenome relate to memory genes. We will further translate these findings in vivo exploiting single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, and flow cytometry assays. The expected outcome of this proposal is a detailed understanding of the fundamental interaction between TCF-1 and the chromatin in peripheral T cells which can be exploited to devise combination therapies including epigenetic editing to selectively alter T cell fate at will. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection. A better understanding of memory T cell differentiation is crucial for developing strategies to limit T cell responses in organ transplantation or enhance T cell responses during chronic infections. The goal of this proposal is to study the role of transcription factor TCF-1 in determining the epigenetic identity of memory CD8+ T cells. ",Critical role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells,10087956,R01HL145754,"['Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Thymus Gland ', ' Thymus ', ' Thymus Proper ', ' Thymus Reticuloendothelial System ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Translating ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Protein Domains ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' Effector Cell ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' mutant ', ' synergism ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immune modulation ', ' immune regulation ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immunomodulatory ', ' immunoregulatory ', ' immunoregulation ', ' novel ', ' memory T lymphocyte ', ' T memory cell ', ' T cell differentiation ', ' T-Cell Activation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' FKHR ', ' FOXO1 ', ' FOXO1A ', ' Forkhead Box O1A ', ' Forkhead in Rhabdomyosarcoma ', ' FOXO1A gene ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' T-Cell Development ', ' T-Cell Ontogeny ', ' T-Lymphocyte Development ', ' in vivo ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' TCF Transcription Factor ', ' LEF Transcription Factor ', ' Lymphoid Enhancer Factor ', ' T Cell Factor ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' T cell response ', ' epigenome ', ' Adaptive Immune System ', ' acquired immune system ', ' chronic infection ', ' persistent infection ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,451689,PA-03
"Pre-mRNA intronic structures in trans factor binding and alternative splicing Project Summary Splicing is the process of removing intronic regions from a precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and combining exons into a mature transcript. Alternative splicing results in differential intron removal, producing multiple alternatively spliced isoforms arising from a common precursor mRNA. The dysregulation of splicing is estimated to underlie at least 15% of human diseases, and is likely to contribute to many more. Splice reactions are performed by the spliceosome, an RNA protein complex that is assembled onto precursor mRNA in stages. The final activity of the spliceosome is influenced by a combination of trans-acting spliceosome factors and cis elements within the precursor mRNA. However, factors involved in cis element function, like sequence motifs and RNA structure folds, are not fully understood, and a majority of such elements remain unidentified. This is particularly true for branchpoint selection, an essential early stage of spliceosome assembly within the intron around the catalytic adenosine. Although the branchpoint is loosely recognized as a highly degenerate sequence motif, it influences downstream splice site selection. My first goal is to elucidate the impact of RNA structure on branchpoint selection by focusing on RNA structure-mediated binding by the spliceosome associated SF3B complex. To do so, I will develop RNA secondary structure models for SF3B-dependent precursor RNAs to identify enriched structural motifs. My work will entail the first large-scale derivation of intronic secondary structures, including branchpoint regions, which will aid in better understanding of how RNA structures around cis regulatory elements influence splicing. My second goal is to develop a system to identify cis splicing regulatory elements and rapidly test their functional significance. To identify regulatory elements, I will identify cis features on mRNAs, including protein binding sites, conservation and RNA secondary structure, and use machine learning to discover novel signatures of functionally relevant cis regulatory regions. The functional impact of such sites on alternative splicing will be experimentally tested through use of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that can block or inhibit the regulatory region. I will set up a positive feedback loop where I can predict cis splice regulatory elements and immediately test their impact on splicing with ASOs, incorporating the test results back into the model to improve predictions. This system will lead to accurate prediction of cis regulatory splicing elements within any gene of interest. Accurate identification of cis elements will improve our ability to understand co-regulation of alternative splicing. The long-term vision of my research is to demystify the splicing code by clarifying the role of RNA structure in splicing and developing a powerful system to identify functional cis regulatory splicing elements and test their activity. Project Narrative Splicing is the process by which introns are removed from precursor mRNA to generate productive transcripts but, if performed incorrectly, can lead to aberrant transcripts and many human diseases. The goal of this project is to understand how RNA structure influences recognition of regulatory elements. Ultimately this research strives to identify elements within precursor mRNAs that regulate splicing and develop tools that can modulate splicing in a predictable manner, revealing more about the role of RNA splicing in disease and leading to therapeutics for splicing-related disorders.",Pre-mRNA intronic structures in trans factor binding and alternative splicing,10275711,R35GM142851,"['Adenosine ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Exons ', ' Feedback ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Structural Models ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' premRNA ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Precursors ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Antisense Oligonucleotides ', ' Anti-Sense Oligonucleotides ', ' Antisense Agent ', ' anti-sense agent ', ' anti-sense oligo ', ' antisense oligo ', ' Mediating ', ' Spliceosomes ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Spliceosome Assembly ', ' Spliceosome Assembly Pathway ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' human disease ', ' ']",NIGMS,CLEMSON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,366211,SC-03
"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),10246192,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Animals ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' Phages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' digestive disorder ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Viruses ', ' Family ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' virology ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' bacterial resistance ', ' Bacteria resistance ', ' Bacteria resistant ', ' Bacterial resistant ', ' resistance to Bacteria ', ' resistance to Bacterial ', ' resistant to Bacteria ', ' resistant to Bacterial ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Caudovirales ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' sequence database ', ' sequencing database ', ' molecular sequence database ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' parasite infection ', ' Parasitic infection ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Norwalk-like Viruses ', ' Norovirus ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Enteric ', ' Enteral ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cell Culture System ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Preparation ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' metagenome ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Population ', ' virome ', ' viral microbiome ', ' human virome ', ' experimental analysis ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' genome annotation ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' dark matter ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' bacteriome ', ' bacterial microbiome ', ' stool sample ', ' stool specimen ', ' contig ', ' enteric virus infection ', ' enteric viral infection ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2021,1809005,MO-01
