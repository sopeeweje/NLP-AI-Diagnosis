"Strengthening the continuity of HIV care in Tanzania with economic support SUMMARY It is increasingly recognized that global goals for HIV epidemic control cannot be realized without improving retention in HIV care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Only 58% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in eastern and southern Africa are virally suppressed, and adherence counseling provided to those with elevated viral loads results in viral suppression only 40-50% of the time. Financial incentives, first used for poverty reduction, have been shown to motivate behavior change and improve engagement in HIV-related services. However, there is a paucity of data about the effectiveness of incentive-based programs for people who have disengaged from HIV care as well as the proactive use of incentives for PLHIV struggling with adherence. This research gap limits our understanding of whether financial incentive programs are worthwhile investments to support lifelong care, which is essential to the success of ‘treatment as HIV prevention’ (TasP). The proposed research will advance global knowledge about the effectiveness of financial incentives for strengthening the continuity of HIV care. We will build on data from a pilot study we conducted in Tanzania which found that an intervention offering a one-time financial incentive to out-of-care PLHIV was feasible, acceptable, and preliminarily efficacious at motivating re-engagement in HIV care. Leveraging our established research program and expertise with behavioral economics, we designed a 5-year, mixed-methods, hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate the financial incentive intervention and describe its successful implementation, with the ultimate goal of closing the gap towards achievement of UNAIDS’ ‘95-95-95’ goals. We will first assess if a one-time financial incentive improves re-engagement in care and durable viral suppression at 12 months among 640 PLHIV in Geita and Kagera Regions who have disengaged from care (Aim 1). We will then measure the effectiveness of short-term financial incentives offered to 692 in-care PLHIV who are at risk of loss to follow-up or poor adherence, with durable viral suppression at 12 months as the outcome (Aim 2). A mixed-methods study will describe implementation successes and challenges and synthesize lessons learned to inform adoption of incentive programs for vulnerable PLHIV (Aim 3). The project is a collaboration of the University of California, Berkeley, Health for a Prosperous Nation, Rasello, Management and Development for Health, and the Tanzania Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly, and Children. At the conclusion of the project, we will have rigorously evaluated the incentive strategy and will understand whether it can mitigate the persistent challenge of disengagement from HIV care, consistent with NIH Office of AIDS Research priorities for implementation research on retention in care and adherence to ART. This information is highly relevant to the spectrum of incentive-based programs being implemented or under consideration to improve the health of PLHIV and to optimize TasP programs in UNAIDS Fast Track countries. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE Although there is increasing evidence that financial incentives can improve the health of people living with HIV infection (PLHIV), it is unknown whether these benefits extend to PLHIV who have disengaged from HIV care. In this study, we will evaluate an incentive-based intervention for Tanzanian adults to support engagement in HIV care and adherence to antiretroviral treatment. Our findings will result in generalizable knowledge about the effectiveness of incentives for retention in HIV care and achievement of global targets to control HIV.",Strengthening the continuity of HIV care in Tanzania with economic support,10161427,R01MH125746,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Eastern Africa ', ' Southern Africa ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Community Developments ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Counseling ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incentives ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tanzania ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' Home visitation ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' motivated behavior ', ' implementation research ', ' markov model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' combat ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' poverty reduction ', ' reduce poverty ', ' financial incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' behavioral economics ', ' recruit ', ' incentive program ', ' incentive-based program ', ' incentive strategies ', ' incentive-based intervention ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research ', ' Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science ', ' Consolidated Framework for Implementing Change ', ' implementation intervention ', ' treatment as prevention ', ' treatment-based prevention ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,690173,CA-13
"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed. Findings will provide fresh guidance for public health interventions targeting early HIV testing and linkage to and retention in HIV medical care for SC HIV-infected individuals. Project Narrative. Treatment as a public health strategy of HIV prevention is important in fighting the national HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis, linkage to, and retention in HIV medical care are key public health strategies for HIV prevention. Missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis as well as inadequate HIV medical care utilization by HIV+ individuals in South Carolina negatively impacts HIV survival outcomes, while increasing population transmission risks. The analyses of population-based health utilization data for HIV+ individuals using powerful machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms will generate new factors useful for improving retention in HIV care. This valuable new information will be translated into ongoing efforts such as SC's Data-to Care and Ryan White care efforts through improved targeting of HIV medical care engagement and reengagement interventions.",Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction,10160773,R01AI127203,"['Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dropout ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Resources ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' South Carolina ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' fighting ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' care seeking ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' surveillance data ', ' public health intervention ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' improved outcome ', ' survival outcome ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' big-data science ', ' treatment research ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,589629,SC-06
"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,10112810,K24AI131928,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Botswana ', ' Bechuanaland ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Circumcision ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Household ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' efavirenz ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' emtricitabine ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' point of care ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' community intervention ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' population based ', ' International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials ', ' IMPAACT ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Regimen ', ' Secure ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' perinatal HIV ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2021,188938,MA-07
"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality). Finally, we will explore the biological functions of the identified methylation sites in postmortem human brain and blood (N = 80) by RNA-seq and correlate methylation-regulated gene expression between WBCs and neural cells. We expect to discover a set of biologically meaningful methylation features as a marker for HIV- infected DSPN and SUD that can predict resilience and outcomes. Employing a rigorous design and a powerful computational approach, this application proposes the first epigenome-based prediction for DSPN, SUD, and their interaction. The identified features can serve as a biomarker for this complex condition and have potential clinical use. The results will enhance the knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in blood and in brain for HIV-infected DSPN and SUD. Distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance use disorder are common in the HIV-infected population and can impact immune resilience and HIV outcomes. Applying a combination of epigenome-wide association and machine learning approaches, we aim to identify a panel of DNA methylation features in white blood cells for HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance misuse that link to immune resilience, HIV frailty and mortality. The selected features can serve as biomarker for neuropathy and enhance our understanding of the interplay between neuropathy and substance misuse in HIV-infected population.",Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection,10171835,R01DA047820,"['Aging ', ' Association Learning ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Envelope Protein gp120 ', ' HIV Envelope Glycoprotein gp120 ', ' HIV env Protein gp120 ', ' HTLV-III gp120 ', ' gp120 ', ' gp120 ENV Glycoprotein ', ' gp120(HIV) ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' White Cell ', ' white blood cell ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nerve Tissue ', ' Nervous Tissue ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Veterans ', ' Polyneuropathy ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' brain tissue ', ' Performance ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' CD8 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8B1 ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Molecular ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' epigenomics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Advanced Development ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxic ', ' biosignature ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' cocaine use ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' epigenome ', ' model building ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' drug misuse ', ' medication misuse ', ' substance misuse ', "" Women's Interagency HIV Study "", ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,570656,CT-03
"East Africa International Epidemiology Database to evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) Regional Consortium Project Summary/Abstract: Our primary goal continues to be the provision of answers to questions that clinicians, governments, programs and international organizations consider central to the evolution and sustainability of their long term HIV care and treatment strategies for achieving the UNAIDS 2030 targets of 95-95-95 in the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and changes in public health funding priorities. Our central hypothesis is that retention in the HIV care cascade and treatment outcomes are influenced by patient-level demographic, clinical, developmental, and behavioral factors, as well as, factors within the ambient health care and broader contextual environment. We will leverage our strengths, including robust working relationships with HIV treatment programs, a substantial harmonized regional database, plus broad experience in sampling-based methodologies and novel analytical approaches. Over the course of this research we will: SA-1: Describe movement through the HIV care cascade with a focus on identifying broader and health care environment contextual factors that influence optimal retention in care and viral suppression, in the face of global disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in donor funding priorities. The Post COVID-19 Double-Sampling Cohort (Post COVID) will address the impact of broader contextual factors (COVID-19) while the Telehealth and Structural Adaptations project will address the impact of health care structure. SA-2: Examine the impact of developmental stage and behavioral factors on retention in the cascade and subsequent outcomes. The multiregional Adolescent and Young Adult Network of IeDEA (AYANI) and regional Measuring Adverse Pregnancy and Newborn Congenital Outcomes (MANGO) cohorts will assess the impact of developmental stage on the cascade, while the Syndemics cohort will address the impact of mental health on the cascade.SA- 3: Examine the immediate and long-term outcomes of people diagnosed with Tuberculosis (TB) with a focus on identifying and addressing factors associated with patient outcomes. The multiregional TB Sentinel Research Network (TB-SRN) will focus on understanding TB outcomes and long-term pulmonary complications including associated factors. SA-4: Explore the use of new technologies, including eHealth and machine (deep) learning to diagnose and manage HIV-associated cancers with a focus on Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) and Cervical Cancer. The KS Project will assess implementation of a Dermatology Telehealth Program and the Cervical Cancer Project will assess the implementation of cervical image capture with machine learning for cancer diagnoses and management. SA-5: Examine the epidemiology of NCD comorbidities and ART complications with a focus on the oldest and youngest-age groups affected by HIV. The multi-regional Sentinel Research Network (SRN) will address non-communicable diseases in people living with HIV (PLHIV) > 40 years and the regional MANGO Cohort will address complications of ART/HIV exposure on HIV-Exposed Infants. Project Narrative: Through our efforts, we will enhance our understanding of the HIV care cascades and the outcomes of care in East Africa, provide insights on the optimal structure and impact of care and treatment programs, expand the set of tools available to inform implementation and operations research in resource-constrained settings and inform policy among stakeholders and decision makers at

"An Adaptive Strategy for Preventing and Treating Lapses of Retention in Adult HIV Care II (ADAPT-R II) Abstract This R34 application is best understood in the context of both a NIH-funded sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) “Adaptive Strategies to Prevent and Treat Lapses of Retention (ADAPT-1)” nearing completion and a future trial (ADAPT-3) motivated by observations from the ADAPT-1. Retention in HIV treatment over long periods of time represents an archetypal complex public health problem and requires innovative solutions. The diversity of intensities and types of barriers to engagement mean that no single intervention is needed by all nor will work for all in need. For example, counseling could help a patient experiencing stigma, but will not help an individual who wants to come but cannot afford transportation. To respond to this conundrum, we carried out a SMART (ADAPT-1) to test a family of adaptive retention strategies. By maintaining lower intensity interventions in those doing well, adaptive strategies optimize efficiency, while escalating in those not doing well enhances effectiveness. In ADAPT-1, we initially randomized patients to one of three lower intensity interventions (standard of care (SOC), SMS messages and a conditional cash transfer). Only those who fail to be consistently retained are re-randomized to one of three more intensive interventions (SOC outreach, SMS message with a conditional cash transfer, or a navigator). Emerging ADAPT-1 results (in forthcoming publications) confirm our original hypothesis that pegging the retention intervention to patient behavior improves outcomes, the study also revealed additional opportunities to extend a “precision public health” paradigm. Specifically, we observed that different patients (based on sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics) respond differentially to different adaptive retention strategies. This observation begs a further hypothesis: use of predictive analytics (optimized with cutting-edge machine learning techniques) to distribute each intervention (e.g., SOC, cash transfer, SMS) to those patients most likely to respond to that intervention can achieve further gains in effectiveness and efficiency over any single sequenced retention strategy, even if strategy is itself already adaptive. We plan a future R01 application to test a machine learning based distribution of retention interventions as compared to best single sequential adaptive interventions (from ADAPT-1). To prepare for the novel trial, we propose this R34, to (1) develop and test the information technology basis for delivering on-demand predictions to health care workers in the field, (2) refine the statistical foundations of machine learning ability to predict through simulations and (3) assess the fit of machine learning based recommendations in the organizational, policy and ethical context of health systems in Kenya. Project Narrative Engagement in HIV treatment, both retention and adherence, represents a persistent, complex health behavior problem in Africa where public health success over the long run demands innovative approaches to retain and virally suppress patients. We propose bringing the cutting edge of data science to the front lines of the HIV response by developing and testing a machine learning-based algorithm “Personalized Retention Recommendation and Learning Systems” (PERLS) to assign a limited set of scalable retention strategies for people living with HIV who are most likely to respond to those interventions in Kenya. This proposed R34 will lay the technological, statistical, and implementation groundwork for a future R01 application (ADAPT-3) which will test the effectiveness of PERLS on clinical endpoints and thereby advance a novel “precisions public health” approach to HIV treatment in Africa.",An Adaptive Strategy for Preventing and Treating Lapses of Retention in Adult HIV Care II (ADAPT-R II),10239002,R34MH121224,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Organizational Policy ', ' Privacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' outreach ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' Information Technology ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' learning ability ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' trial design ', ' retention rate ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' service delivery ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,215975,MO-01
"Defining the impact of injection drug use on antiretroviral therapy and HIV treatment outcomes: an (epi)genomic approach Although uptake of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in people who inject drugs (PWID) infected with HIV has increased dramatically in the past decade, poor health outcomes including non-AIDS-related comorbidity and mortality in HIV-infected PWID on cART remains a significant public health problem. A crucial knowledge gap is a lack of the understanding about how injection drug use (IDU) impacts the course of HIV disease. Differences in gene regulation affected by IDU and non-adherence to cART are likely to affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these treatments that may result in poor outcomes. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify genomic signatures for PWID and to link PWID-associated genomic signals to HIV outcomes in the context of cART exposure (i.e., levels in plasma). Our overall hypothesis is that PWID accrue DNA methylation (DNAm) and transcriptome variations that impact on health outcomes, and which may be explained in part by variability in cART exposure. This hypothesis is built on our previous findings showing that IDU significantly altered the blood DNA methylome in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, DNAm signatures associated with IDU differentiated less and greater HIV disease frailty. To test this hypothesis, our approach will first perform epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis and transcriptome-wide association analysis in HIV-infected PWID as compared to HIV-infected non-PWID who are treated with cART in two independent cohorts. Second, we will test the relationship between PWID-associated differentially methylated positions (DMP) or regions (DMR) and differential gene expression (DGE) on cART variability in plasma and also their relationships with HIV frailty and mortality. Last, we propose to integrate genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]), DNAm, and gene expression that differs by HIV-infected PWID/non-PWID status. Our goal is to identify DMP or DMR and DGE between HIV-infected PWID and non-PWID in the context of cART and to apply epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures as biomarkers to predict HIV frailty and mortality. The application proposes the first integrative pharmacogenomic approach of genetic variants, epigenomic and transcriptomic associations for HIV-infected PWID in the context of cART. We expect to identify PWID- associated genes that can predict HIV cART treatment outcomes. The predictive model resulting from this project can inform biomarker identification for HIV outcomes. The proposal is the first step towards the understanding of pharmacogenomics and pharamcoepigenomics in PWID with HIV infection. The results will fill the knowledge gap of the biological basis of IDU effects on HIV outcomes and provide evidence to prioritize genes for future research of their functions in HIV progression. People who inject drug use infected with HIV have high medical comorbidity and poor health outcomes despite the availability of combination anti-retroviral therapy. Our integrative pharmacogenomic approach aims to define a set of genes associated with HIV-infected injection drug use and anti-retroviral therapy that predict HIV outcomes. Our work will generate not only knowledge about how injection drug use perturbs the HIV- infected host epigenome and transcriptome, but also potential biomarkers to predict individual HIV outcomes in the context of combination antiretroviral therapy.",Defining the impact of injection drug use on antiretroviral therapy and HIV treatment outcomes: an (epi)genomic approach,10216209,R01DA047063,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' indexing ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' uptake ', ' gene function ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' PWID ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' cohort ', ' intravenous drug use ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' epigenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' injection drug use ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' bead chip ', ' BeadChip ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' genomic signature ', ' genomic classifier ', "" Women's Interagency HIV Study "", ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' PK/PD ', ' Mendelian randomization ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,363122,CT-03
"HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary I propose to implement an innovative mixed methods study using machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How are the semantic features of social media communication (i.e., key terms and concepts) among YBMSM related to their HIV prevention and care engagement?; (2) How are structural features of observed social media relationships among YBMSM related to their prevention and care engagement?; and (3) Can social media use patterns predict future prevention and care engagement? To pursue these questions, I will draw on data collected March 2016-March 2019 from YBMSM participants in an ongoing network HIV prevention intervention (N=423). Prevention and care engagement behaviors include retention in care (HIV/PrEP/Primary), STI/HIV testing, and condom use. Participant social media data include: (1) Facebook posts, (2) Facebook friendships, and (3) Facebook group memberships. K99 Phase: Research conducted during the K99 Phase will use machine learning techniques for textual analysis, semantic network characterization, and regression models to identify the semantic features of participants' communication and their association with HIV prevention and care engagement. I will receive mentored training in 5 key areas: (1) knowledge of issues relevant to HIV prevention, care and treatment for MSM; (2) machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling; (3) advanced stochastic network modeling, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs); and (4) design and implementation of social media based interventions for health promotion; and (5) professional development. R00 Phase: For the R00 I will employ one-mode and two- mode ERGMs to determine how prevention and care engagement behaviors affect the structure of observed social media relationships. I will then develop a predictive model for prevention and care engagement on the basis of individuals' social media use patterns. This K99/R00 award mechanism will be critical to my success in achieving long-term success as an expert in the social and communicative dynamics of HIV prevention and care engagement in high-risk populations. It will also pave the way to an R01 application – based on a longitudinal design – of YMSMs' social and communication engagement in a more diverse array of online social networking sites, including both general purpose and dating platforms. The goal of this project will be to utilize that information to establish classes of YMSM on the basis of their heterogeneous patterns of social media use to better understand their synergistic effects on HIV prevention and care engagement practices over time. This is an important next step in understanding how online social environments impact prevention engagement and will help identify causal relationships that may be amenable to network intervention. Project Narrative This proposal is an innovative mix methods design that utilizes machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The proposed research will sharpen our understanding of the degree to which online social environments support protective or risky behavioral norms and, consequently the degree to which they reveal viable points for intervention. It will also demonstrate how social media data can help front-line staff profile clients in near real-time and predict future HIV-related outcomes like retention failure, thereby serving as an indicator to guide decisions on screening, treatment, and other service provisions.",HIV Prevention and Care,10261551,R00HD094648,"['Affect ', ' Archives ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Socialization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' TimeLine ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Friendships ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Graph ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Group Affiliation ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' protective behavior ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' peer influence ', ' Network-based ', ' network models ', ' social networking website ', ' on-line social networking ', ' online social networking ', ' social networking site ', ' social networking web site ', ' web-based social networking ', ' HIV/STD ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' longitudinal design ', ' screening ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bi-sexual Transgender ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' sexual health intervention ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' AAMSM ', ' African American MSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' BMSM ', ' black MSM ', ' peer networks ', ' socialization behavior ', ' social media ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' Service provision ', ' Facebook ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R00,2021,204891,CA-37
"HIV/ART, low birth weight, and mortality in HIV-exposed uninfected children: a translational mechanistic study Abstract Despite the rapid scale-up of lifelong triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) among pregnant women living with HIV (WLH), children born to WLH continue to have an increased risk of low birth weight (LBW), morbidity, and mortality compared to infants born to women who are not living with HIV. Although the association between LBW and decreased child survival has been well studied, the biological mechanisms linking HIV or ART and LBW are not well described. To better understand how HIV/ART increases the risk of LBW, we leverage an ongoing, well-characterized cohort of women living with HIV enrolled in a trial of data-driven continuous quality intervention to improve long term outcomes of ART in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; our specific focus is on HIV-associated inflammation, immune activation, and microbial communities in the context of universal ART. A cohort of 600 women living with HIV on ART and 600 HIV-negative control along with their HIV-exposed un-infected (HEU) and HIV unexposed (HU) infants will be recruited and followed up through delivery and up to 12 months postpartum to determine how HIV/ART-induced placental dysfunction (Aim 1) or microbial dysbiosis (Aim 2) modulate the risk of LBW and subsequent infant mortality. Using biological specimen obtained from those women, we will document histopathologic placental abnormalities (e.g. necrosis) and measure levels of markers of inflammation, immune activation, and microbial translocation. We will also use a cutting-edge microbiome and virome toolkit with machine learning and ecosystem modeling approaches to evaluate associations between these entities and inflammation and LBW, as well as in silico test myriad mechanistic hypotheses derived from functional analyses. We expect that completion of these complementary aims will provide insight into the biological mechanism(s) associated with increased risk of LBW among HIV-exposed infants. This insight could ultimately identify an optimal HIV- treatment or care modality for pregnant WLH: one which promotes maternal health, prevents HIV mother-to-child transmission, and maximizes infant survival. PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV-infected women have a greater prevalence of low birth weight infants than HIV-uninfected women. We expect that a greater understanding of the mechanism of low birth weight among WLHIV on ART will lead to improved birth outcomes.","HIV/ART, low birth weight, and mortality in HIV-exposed uninfected children: a translational mechanistic study",10258233,R01HD105526,"['Antibodies ', ' Attention ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Fetus ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Morbidity -

"Immune response to COVID-19 vaccine in HIV infected men and women ABSTRACT The CDC recommends that persons living with HIV (PWH) be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. However, there are minimal scientific data to support this important public health principle in relation to ongoing immune dysfunction and chronic comorbidities and the persistent HIV reservoir in antiretroviral treated (ART) PWH. We propose that a formal, comprehensive, longitudinal study in a well-characterized cohort of male and female PWH compared to HIV uninfected controls (HUC) is essential to assess the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in PWH. The MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) is ideal for analyzing the interactive impact of chronic HIV infection on COVID-19 Pfizer and Moderna RNA-based vaccine immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the HIV reservoir. In Aim 1, we propose to conduct an in- depth analysis of antibody neutralizing function and B lymphocyte responses in 100 male PWH and 100 female vaccinated PWH, and 25 male and 25 female vaccinated HUC, from the MWCCS. In Aim 2, we will extensively characterize immune cell phenotypes, soluble markers, and functional cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the participants from Aim 1 before and after vaccination. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the effects of COVID-19 vaccine on the persistent HIV reservoir (amount and composition, immune parameters) before and after immunization. Aim 4 applies machine learning approaches on the entire set of features quantified in Aims 1-3 to predict COVID-19 vaccine response outcomes and determine the critical parameters that influence vaccine responses. We believe that this study is unique, important, and critically timely for assessing the scientifically unprecedented, vaccine prevention phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of HIV infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will determine the strength and duration of the immune responses induced by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of people with HIV infection (PWH) and develop a model based on clinical parameters to predict the vaccine immune responses. Such information will help health care experts develop proper public health policy decisions for prevention of COVID-19 disease.",Immune response to COVID-19 vaccine in HIV infected men and

"Predictive Analytics for Retention in HIV Care Retention in care is essential to HIV treatment and prevention, yet less than half of people living with HIV in the U.S. are retained in medical care. Effective retention interventions, such as intensive case management and patient navigation, are highly resource intensive. With diminishing resources for HIV care, better approaches are needed to identify patients at highest risk for retention failure who would most benefit from retention resources. A predictive model may quantify a specific patient's risk of future retention-in-care failure based on his/her unique characteristics. Such a predictive model based on electronic health data and supplemental social factor informed data could be automated to generate risk prediction in real time. Instead of attempting to locate and re-engage patients who are “lost to follow-up” as is the current practice, a predictive model would allow case managers to identify at risk clients and intervene to prevent retention failure before it occurs. I have a strong background in clinical informatics, biostatistics, and epidemiology. Through this K23, I will further develop my skills in longitudinal data analysis and advanced data analytics and create a predictive model of retention in care. In Aim 1, I will create a predictive model of retention in care using EHR data from a large clinical data research network spanning 11 healthcare systems in Chicago, utilizing mixed effects logistic regression and random forest. Through Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the addition of supplemental social factor informed electronic data sources into the predictive model enhances its performance (e.g., unstructured text of EHR notes, geospatial data, social media data). Finally, in Aim 3, I will explore the feasibility of using the model in real time to increase retention efforts for at-risk patients. I will complete this project under the supervision of my mentor (Dr. John Schneider), co-mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), and my advisory team (Dr. Robert Gibbons, Rayid Ghani, and Dr. C. Hendricks Brown). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in HIV research, EHR research, longitudinal data analysis, natural language processing, social media data, implementation science, and ethics. In addition, they serve as Directors of the Chicago Center for HIV Elimination (Schneider), Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Meltzer), Center for Data Science and Public Policy (Ghani), Center for Health Statistics (Gibbons), and Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Brown). An integrated program of coursework, seminars, structured mentorship, research activities, and conferences will provide me with the skills necessary to complete the proposed research and transition to independence. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator utilizing HIV informatics to develop prediction models and tools to inform HIV prevention and treatment across the HIV care continuum. The mentorship and training that I will receive through this K23 award will provide me with the foundation necessary to pursue that goal and this proposal will form the basis for future R01 proposals. Retention in care is essential for HIV treatment and prevention, yet less than half of people living with HIV in the United States are retained in medical care. Electronic data, including advanced electronic health records, geospatial data, and social media profile data, can be used to create an automated predictive model to identify individuals at highest risk for retention in care failure. Instead of attempting to locate and re-engage patients who are no longer retained in care as is the current practice, a predictive model will allow case managers to identify at risk individuals and provide personalized retention resources based on individual risk factors before patients disengage from care.",Predictive Analytics for Retention in HIV Care,10219108,K23MH121190,"['Adult ', ' 21+

"The Neuroimmunology of Depression in Women Living With HIV PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In response to RFA-DA-21-116, “Mood Disorders in People Living with HIV: Mechanisms and Pathways”, we propose to investigate neuroimmunological and reward functions to study comorbid depression in women living with HIV (WLWH), a group heavily impacted by depression and its health consequences, yet underrepresented in HIV research. The proposed research will build upon the established Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (Dr. Sharma, MPI of Bronx MWCCS) and its unique cohort of phenotypically well-characterized women with and without HIV. Our proposed model is: (1) HIV infection induces systemic inflammation (cytokines, kynurenines); (2) systemic inflammation extends to the CNS inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, major inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neurochemical changes alter the reward circuitry, which contribute to the high prevalence of depression in WLWH. In support of this model, our immunological work in the WIHS found increased kynurenine pathway (KP) activity in WLWH compared to women without HIV, and among WLWH, KP activity was higher in WLWH with depression. In our depression non-HIV research, we found that anhedonia–a core symptom of depression reflecting reward deficits–was associated with worse depression outcomes, including chronicity and suicidality. To better delineate reward circuitry, we identified distinct resting-state network features associated with depression and anhedonia using striatal-based intrinsic functional connectivity and whole-brain parcellation data-driven graph theory analysis. We additionally utilized the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks to examine distinct brain activity during reward anticipation, attainment, and prediction errors, which predicted future depression severity. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy, we showed that anhedonia accounted for decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA levels in adolescent depression, and moreover, we documented inverse relationships between cortical GSH and anhedonia severity in depressed adults. Furthermore, we reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry in youth. Extending our compelling findings, we will now test the overall hypothesis that WLWH exhibit increased systemic and CNS inflammation, which leads to reward dysfunction and subsequently depression. We will utilize a 2×2 factorial design: 1) 100 depressed WLWH; 2) 100 non-depressed WLWH; 3) 50 depressed HIV negative women; and 4) 50 non-depressed HIV- negative women. Participants will have comprehensive evaluations at baseline, 6- and 12-months assessing depression, reward, anxiety, trauma, HIV treatment, CD4+ count, and VL. F-MRI (resting-state, RFT, RPET), 1H MRS (GABA, GSH), a reward computerized task and cognitive tests will be done at baseline.  PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to investigate neuroimmunological and reward functions to study comorbid depression in women living with HIV (WLWH), a group heavily impacted by depression and its health consequences yet underrepresented in HIV research. This collaborative proposal bridges disciplines of depression, neuroimaging, HIV, and metabolomics in an effort to improve our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying depression in WLWH and has the potential to improve overall and mental health outcomes in this highly vulnerable group.",The Neuroimmunology of Depression in Women Living With HIV,10370113,R01MH128878,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years

"Patterns and predictors of viral suppression: A Big Data approach Abstract Viral suppression is the final stage of the HIV treatment cascade, which serves as the framework for UNAIDS’ 90-90-90 goals. Sustained viral suppression is one of four strategic areas of the “Ending the HIV Epidemic (EtHE): A Plan for America” federal campaign, launched in February 2019, which aims for the reduction of new HIV infections in the United States (US) by 75% and 90% by 2025 and 2030, respectively. The EtHE campaign focuses on 48 US counties and 7 states, including South Carolina (SC). Given the importance of viral suppression in ending the US HIV epidemic, an optimal predictive model of viral status can help clinicians identify those at risk of poor viral control and inform clinical improvements in HIV treatment and care. Various indicators to characterize the longitudinal virologic outcomes have been proposed in the literature such as sustained viral suppression, viral rebound, low-level viraemia (LLV), persistent LLV, and virologic blips. However, some critical gaps still exist in our efforts to develop an optimal predictive model of viral suppression. These gaps include the use of limited indicators of virologic outcomes, limited duration of follow-up, limited data sources, lack of consideration of structural and socioenvironmental data, small or unrepresentative samples of people living with HIV (PLWH), and limited efforts to translate research findings into service-ready tools for clinical use. With NIH support (R01AI127203) since 2017, we have utilized a Big Data approach to examine treatment gaps (e.g., missed opportunities for diagnosis and linkage to care) among a statewide cohort of PLWH in SC. This ongoing research extracted longitudinal electronic health records data from six state agencies and then linked the patient-level data with county-level data (e.g., socioeconomic indicators, number of health care professionals, hospitals, and health care facilities) from multiple publicly available data sources. The resultant integrated database has enabled us to successfully “track” 11,470 patients who were diagnosed with HIV from 2005 to 2016 in SC and identify the gaps in HIV treatment linkage and retention. Based on the experience and accomplishment of the R01AI127203, we submit this application to examine the longitudinal dynamic pattern of viral suppression, develop optimal predictive models of various viral suppression indicators, and translate the models to service-ready tools for clinical use. In the proposed research, we will: 1) continue to “follow” our cohort for another five years (and also expand the cohort by adding PLWH diagnosed between 2016-2020); 2) expand our database to include additional data on critical predictors of viral suppression (e.g., treatment and laboratory data, alcohol and substance use data) from two newly participating statewide data sources; 3) employ artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling to understand the dynamic viral load patterns and their predictors; and 4) develop and pilot-test a multifactorial decision system for clinical use. The results will enable the identification of PLWH with poor viral control and suggest “when” and “how” to help those PLWH achieve and maintain viral suppression. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of viral suppression and inform tailored HIV care management among PLWH in SC and beyond. Project Narrative The overall goal of the proposed research is to integrate individual-level data from eight state agencies and county-level data from multiple open data sources and develop a prediction model for multiple viral load indicators through AI-based modeling, accounting for factors at the individual level, structural level, and socioenvironmental level among people living with HIV (PLWH) in South Carolina. The results will enable the identification of PLWH with poor viral control and further inform healthcare providers of “when” and “how” to help those PLWH achieve and maintain viral suppression. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of viral suppression and inform effective HIV control strategies towards the goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the US.",Patterns and predictors of viral suppression: A Big Data approach,10321732,R01AI164947,"['Accounting ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Americas ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' South Carolina ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Viremia ', ' viraemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' virusemia ', ' virology ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' prisma ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' national surveillance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' surveillance data ', ' Regimen ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' viral rebound ', ' virus rebound ', ' risk prediction model ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,717540,SC-06
"The South African National HIV Pregnancy Cohort: evaluating continuity of care among women living with HIV ABSTRACT For the first time on a national level, we propose to utilize routinely-collected laboratory data to develop a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa in a way that is uniquely robust to transfer across facilities. South Africa is home to more people living with HIV than any other country, and nearly one in three pregnant women attending antenatal care is living with HIV. Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased substantially since the start of the national ART program in 2004, with >95% ART coverage during pregnancy and delivery, and mother-to-child transmission of HIV greatly reduced. However, our work has demonstrated that women who initiate ART during pregnancy are at heightened risk of dropping out of care, particularly after delivery, leading to the potential for viral transmission, morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to evaluate the success of policies of expanded access to ART care, and assess continuity of care, due to the lack of a national longitudinal HIV care database. In addition, patient movement between unlinked facilities means that self-transfer often is misclassified as loss to care. To address this major shortcoming, our team at the Health Economics and Epidemiology Office (HE2RO) partnered with the South African National Health Laboratory Services in 2015 to use existing HIV-related laboratory data to create the South African National HIV Cohort. Now, through this five-year award, we propose to expand this successful project to use routinely- collected laboratory data to develop a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa. We propose three specific aims. First, we will develop and validate a novel national cohort of pregnant women accessing HIV care. Using laboratory test data matched to facility type, we will identify entry to antenatal care to build the cohort, then describe key treatment milestones, including 1) engagement in antenatal care, 2) initiation of ART, 3) HIV viremia, and 4) continuity of HIV care in the postpartum period. Second, we will measure the effect of system-wide factors impacting continuity of care among pregnant women. We will assess policies of expanded treatment access on continuity of care using regression-discontinuity analyses. We then will assess mobility and its effect on continuity of care during and after pregnancy. Third, we will identify individual-level risk factors for loss from HIV care in order to develop targeted interventions to improve engagement in HIV care.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Women who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy in South Africa are at high risk of dropping out of care – particularly after delivery – but efforts to evaluate continuity of HIV care among pregnant and postpartum women have been hampered by lack of a national longitudinal HIV care database. Through this five-year award, we propose to use routinely-collected laboratory data to develop a national cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa that is uniquely robust to patient transfer. This novel cohort of pregnant women will be a powerful tool available to policymakers, clinicians and researchers for improving our understanding of engagement in care among pregnant women in South Africa and assessing the performance of the South African national ART program in caring for pregnant women living with HIV.",The South African National HIV Pregnancy Cohort: evaluating continuity of care among women living with HIV,10137991,R01HD103466,"['Award ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breast fed ', ' Breastfed ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Patient Transfer ', ' Patients ', ' Postpartum Women ', ' Post-partum Women ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Sector ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Viremia ', ' viraemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' virusemia ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Vertical Disease Transmission ', ' Vertical Transmission ', ' mother to child transmission ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' health economics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Mother-to-child HIV transmission ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' South African ', ' postpartum care ', ' post-partum care ', ' antenatal ', ' antepartum ', ' patient mobility ', ' antenatal care ', ' data tools ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,"WITS HEALTH CONSORTIUM (PTY), LTD",R01,2021,335338,
"Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in Children and Adolescents with HIV in Zambia Project Summary/Abstract:  This proposal represents a five-year research career development program focused on the study of longitudinal cognitive outcomes among children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate’s prior research and experience, and will introduce the candidate to new skills that will be shared by the mentorship team led by Dr. Gretchen Birbeck, an expert in neuroepidemiology and clinical trials in resource-limited settings. The proposed training and mentored research will enable the candidate to transition to an independent research career focused on neurologic complications of HIV.  Cognitive impairment is common in children with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in low-resource settings, affecting up to 50% of perinatally-infected children in Sub-Saharan Africa. In children with HIV receiving Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), opportunistic infections and severe HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy have become less common, but more subtle forms of cognitive impairment have increased in prevalence. The foundation for this proposal is based on research conducted by the candidate as part of the HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders in Zambia (HANDZ) study, in which 208 children and adolescents with HIV and 208 HIV-exposed uninfected controls were recruited, and clinical risk factors and biomarkers for cognitive impairment were evaluated. In the HANDZ study, we found that serum markers produced by activated platelets and pro- inflammatory monocytes associated with depression, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment, suggesting that platelet-monocyte complexes (PMCs) may be key drivers in HIV-associated cognitive impairment. In the proposed project, the population recruited as part of HANDZ will be followed longitudinally for a total of five years, and an additional HIV-unexposed uninfected control group will be recruited.  The aims of this proposal include 1) To evaluate whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes predict depression and cognitive outcomes in ART-treated children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia 2) To assess whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes are associated with cerebrovascular disease in ART-treated children and adolescents with HIV and 3) To develop a comprehensive predictive model of cognitive change in children with HIV incorporating clinical characteristics, plasma biomarkers, and imaging biomarkers. The short- term goal of this application is to 1) Train the applicant through mentored research 2) Identify a subpopulation of children and adolescents with HIV at high risk of cognitive decline and 3) From clinical profiles, plasma biomarkers and imaging characteristics, identify factors associated with the greatest effect on cognitive outcomes that can be targeted in future intervention studies. The long-term impact will include setting the stage for clinical trials of interventions to prevent or treat HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in children and adolescents. Project Narrative As a consequence of the widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy, HIV in children and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa is evolving from a universally fatal illness into a chronic condition, often complicated by comorbidities including depression, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. However, there are few longitudinal studies assessing these comorbidities in children and adolescents in low-resource settings. This prospective study of Zambian children and adolescents will identify risk factors and biomarkers for HIV- associated comorbidities that will set the stage for future clinical trials.",Longitudinal

"Leveraging large-scale administrative claims data to evaluate prescription opioid use, risks, and outcomes in older adults living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide support for me to become an independent investigator with a multidisciplinary research program in HIV at the intersection of prescription drug use, comorbidities, and aging. In this project, I propose to leverage existing administrative claims data from Medicare beneficiaries ≥65 years of age from 2007-2018 to determine how high-risk prescription opioid use, e.g. high dose use (≥120 mg/day) or prolonged use (≥90 days), affects health outcomes and health care utilization in older people living with HIV (PLWH). Building on my strong foundation in HIV epidemiology and HIV comorbidities across the lifespan, the training from this K01 will allow me to (1) obtain proficiency in the analysis of large-scale, longitudinal administrative claims data; (2) attain content expertise in prescription drug utilization research and pharmacoepidemiology; and (3) develop expertise in the application of machine learning methods. My career development plan includes specific coursework, seminars, conferences, directed readings, and tailored mentoring from a multidisciplinary team comprised of experts in administrative claims data, substance use epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, and machine learning methods. Rutgers University provides an exceptional environment for completion of this training, with research support and infrastructure for analyzing large, multiyear datasets (including Medicare claims) and conducting high-impact HIV research. The proposed research is significant given that a substantial gap exists in understanding how prescription opioid use affects a growing population of aging PLWH who commonly report chronic pain, and have multiple comorbidities, increasing polypharmacy, and increased risk for untoward drug-drug interactions. This research is critical to target appropriate prevention and treatment programs to optimize health outcomes for this population. To fill this gap, specific aims are to: (1) Assess the associations between HIV infection and a) adverse health outcomes (e.g. falls/fractures, dementia, mortality) and b) health care utilization (e.g. emergency department use, inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient visits) among older adults, and estimate the interaction between HIV infection and high-risk prescription opioid use on adverse outcomes and utilization; (2) Among older PLWH, estimate drug-drug interactions between high-risk prescription opioid use and specific antiretroviral drug classes or sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines) on risk of adverse health outcomes and health care utilization; and (3) Examine the feasibility of applying existing machine learning approaches to predict adverse health outcomes and high health care utilization among older PLWH based on patient profiles and opioid prescription patterns in a large administrative claims database. Findings from this project will generate valuable new information and tools to support clinical decisions and more precisely target prevention and treatment interventions to improve health for older PLWH who are prescribed opioids, and directly inform an R01 application to study drug-drug and drug- disease interactions between widely used prescription drugs and common comorbidities among older PLWH. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with HIV (PLWH) commonly report chronic pain and are more likely to receive prescription opioids, placing them at elevated risk for adverse events. However, data are limited for a growing population of older PLWH 65+ years with multiple comorbidities, increasing polypharmacy, and increased risk for untoward drug- drug interactions. Using large-scale administrative claims data and machine learning approaches, this project will analyze prescription opioid use, risks, and outcomes in older PLWH, generating valuable new information and tools to support clinical decisions and more precisely target prevention and treatment interventions to improve health for older PLWH who use opioids.","Leveraging large-scale administrative claims data to evaluate prescription opioid use, risks, and outcomes in older adults living with HIV",10161305,K01DA053157,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inpatients ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Long Acting Film Technology for Contraception and HIV Prevention (LATCH) PROJECT ABSTRACT Several studies (ASPIRE, VOICE) have shown that adherence is paramount to the success of HIV prevention methods in women. Providing women with options through alternative drug delivery technologies can positively impact adherence. A compelling strategy includes co-delivery of an anti-HIV agent with a contraceptive agent to prevent pregnancy. This proposal plans to develop a next generation multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) film platform for once a month intravaginal administration of the 4'-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) prodrug (EFdA-P) and a progestin (levonorgestrel (LNG) or etonogestrel (ENG)) to achieve the dual goal of preventing HIV infection and pregnancy. EFdA-P showed increased bioavailability and tissue permeability compared to the parent EFdA, a highly potent exciting new antiviral drug. This versatile extended release MPT film platform is intended to provide a discrete, low cost and convenient alternative to women at high risk of HIV infection and unintended pregnancy. Recent data from our lab shows that films can deliver an anti-HIV agent in the vagina for up to 1 month even in the context of menses and sexual intercourse. Using this knowledge and our expertise in the development of intravaginal films, this proposal will develop a film platform for co-delivery of a progestin (licensed contraceptive agent) and EFdA-P at a predetermined rate for at least 1 month. MPT films containing EFdA will also be generated for comparison. The R61 phase of this milestone driven proposal will generate critical preformulation data for EFdA/EFdA-P and LNG/ENG drug combinations and optimize the MPT film formulation to achieve one- month delivery of both drugs with desired short-term stability. This phase will also establish the compatibility of film prototype with vaginal tissue and microbial flora in vitro followed by vaginal retention studies in the non- human primate (NHP) model. The R61 phase will demonstrate the ability of the MPT film prototype to attain desired release profiles of both drugs in vivo (NHP model). Using a clearly defined go / no go criteria, a lead MPT film will be transitioned to the R33 phase. The R33 phase will involve IND-enabling activities including drug- drug interaction, in vitro transporter and metabolism studies, manufacturing scale up and establishing long-term stability of the lead MPT film. It will also demonstrate the safety (rat, rabbit, and NHP) and efficacy of the lead MPT film against SHIV infection in NHP model. It will also confirm the ability of the film to function in the context of sexual activity and its ability to deliver contraceptive levels of progestin in the NHP model. The successful completion of proposed work will generate a novel extended release MPT film platform that can be applied to other drug combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The adherence of women to anti-HIV and contraceptives can be improved by providing convenient low-cost alternative product options. This project will develop novel extended release vaginal films that co-deliver anti- HIV and contraceptive agents for one month upon single intravaginal administration.",Long Acting Film Technology

"Southern HIV and Alcohol Research Consortium Biomedical Data Repository Abstract: The number of persons living with HIV (PLWH) continues to increase in the United States. Alcohol consumption is a significant barrier to both achieving the goal of ending the HIV epidemic and preventing comorbidities among PLWH, as it contributes to both HIV transmission and HIV-related complications. Recent advances in data capture systems such as mHealth devices, medical imaging, and high-throughput biotechnologies make large/complex research and clinical datasets available, including survey data, multi-omics data, electronic medical records, and/or other sources of reliable information related to engagement in care. This offers tremendous potential of applying “big” data to extract knowledge and insights regarding fundamental physiology, understand the mechanisms by which the pathogenic effects of biotic and abiotic factors are realized, and identify potential intervention targets. We propose to integrate the disparate data sources maintained by our partners and then utilize the big data to address research questions in treating HIV and alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. Specifically, we will pursue the following three aims: 1) Integrate the disparate data sources through standardization, harmonization, and merging; 2) Develop a web-based data sharing platform including virtual data sharing communities, data privacy protection, streamlined data approval and access, and tracking of ongoing research activities; 3) Provide statistical support to junior investigators to use the data repository for exploratory data analysis and proposal development. The proposed study will tap into disparate data sources, unleash the potential of data and information, accelerate knowledge discovery, advance data-powered health, and transform discovery to improve health outcomes for PLWH. Project Narrative We propose to integrate the disparate research data, and then utilize novel statistical and AI approaches to address research questions in treating HIV and alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. The proposed study will unleash the potential of data and information, accelerate knowledge discovery, advance data-powered health, and transform discovery to improve health outcomes for people living with HIV.",Southern HIV and Alcohol Research Consortium Biomedical Data Repository,10401614,U24AA029959,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Epidemic ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' hep C ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Institutes ', ' Masks ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Morbidity -

"Immunometabolicgene expression profiles associated with depressed mood and behavioral domains inpeople with HIV SUMMARY This project will leverage emerging knowledge about the role of immunometabolism in the pathophysiology of depression in people with HIV to generate hypotheses about potential future treatments. Depression in PWH is characterized by features that differentiate it from depression in people without HIV (PWoH). The first is the predominance of anhedonia - inability to gain enjoyment from activities. The second is a higher prevalence of depression that is resistant to treatment with standard antidepressant drugs in PWH versus PWoH. These clinical observations suggest not only that the underlying pathophysiology of depression is different between the two populations, but that different treatments are needed to successfully treat depression in PWH. Molecular studies of immunometabolism, defined as reciprocal interactions between immunity and metabolism that are dysregulated and linked to depression in PWH, support these distinctions. Based on our preliminary data and that in the literature, we propose to perform RNA-Seq transcriptomics, relating immunometabolic gene expression to protein and other biomarkers of immunometabolism, and to clinical depression as well as to cognitive processes impacted by depression. Our hypothesis-driven approach will focus on two interacting, co-regulated gene pathways central to depression and immunometabolism, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the NLRP3 inflammasome. We will study 80 newly recruited PWH and 40 age- matched PWoH. Given our early work suggesting that the relationship between immunometabolism and depression is sex-dependent, we aim for a 50/50 breakdown of men and premenopausal women in order to examine sex differences in these relationships. To optimize the spectrum of depressive symptom severity in our sample (e.g., avoid over-representation of individuals with minimal depressive symptoms), we will stratify with a 50/50 breakdown above and below the previously established Beck Depression Inventory-II cut-score for clinically-significant depressive symptoms (≥16). Since clinical studies cannot rigorously establish mechanistic relationships, we will study in parallel the roles of mTOR and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in depression-like behaviors in a mouse model of HIV infection, EcoHIV, which expresses seven of nine key human HIV proteins. These pathways will be dissected using mTOR and NLRP3 inhibitors. Also, in these animals we will characterize immunometabolic markers in brain tissue, presumably the substrate of depression. NARRATIVE Depression remains common in people with HIV (PWH) despite viral suppression; it has important adverse consequences including poor engagement in HIV care and poor health-related quality of life, and it is often treatment resistant. We will characterize specific gene pathways relevant to depression, potentially leading to future treatments for depression in PWH.",Immunometabolicgene expression profiles associated with depressed

"North American AIDS Cohorts on Collaboration and Design (NAACCORD) The North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) has represented Region 1 of the leDEA initiative since 2006. The 23 single and multi-site clinical and classical epidemiologic HIV cohorts of the NA-ACCORD encompass most HIV cohorts within the US and Canada. Over 100 sites contribute data collected from over 190,000 people with HIV (PWH). We have established a strong collaborative infrastructure that capitalizes on the talents and expertise of a multi-disciplinary group of investigators that span basic science, clinical research, epidemiology, data informatics and biostatistics. We have been highly productive in addressing our previous Aims and key questions in contemporary care and public health relevant to adult PWH. Our strengths are especially relevant to the goals of the US DHHS Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative, uniquely providing the broad geographic and demographic scope, established scientific platform, large sample size, extensive longitudinal follow-up of >1.3 million person-years, and depth of clinical data to inform the goals of EHE with rich data on those who will continue to survive with HIV after transmission is halted. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on HIV outcomes and trends in HIV indicators, as well as longer-term outcomes of COVID-19 among PWH, can be answered in the NA-ACCORD. Within this context, we present three broadly-defined aims for the next funding cycle: Aim 1: Characterize the longitudinal course of HIV treatment, progression and outcomes in North America in the setting of the EHE initiative, which will increase the number and heterogeneity of those in HIV care as HIV treatment and the long-term challenges of living with HIV continue to evolve. Aim 2: To assess and characterize the clinical course of HIV infection in North America, with a focus on major non-AIDS comorbidities and co-infections, multimorbidity and comorbidity- free life expectancy. Aim 3: To expand and extend our state-of-the art epidemiologic, biostatistical, and data science methodologic approaches. The NA-ACCORD is a world-class collaboration of established HIV cohorts well-positioned to a) provide in-depth understanding of the longitudinal course of HIV when extraordinary efforts are being made to EHE; b) collaborate with the other IeDEA regions to inform the future HIV epidemics in low- and middle-income regions; and c) understand differences in HIV treatment, outcomes and prognostic factors that will inform future research and HIV care globally. The NA-ACCORD is the most wide-ranging and in-depth collaboration of HIV cohorts that exists within North America. Its large sample size, the comprehensiveness and quality of its data, combined with the expert use of state-of-the-art statistical methods will allow us to provide answers to the most pressing questions of contemporary importance for the care and outcomes of people with HIV in the US and Canada. The questions will inform the End the HIV Epidemic initiative and provide important information on the long-term course of HIV disease.",North American AIDS Cohorts on Collaboration and Design

"Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) Approach to Understanding the Biology Underlying HIV and Drug Abuse. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed study is to advance our understanding of the complex networks of biology underlying variation in HIV viral load (VL) and latent reservoir (LR) among HIV+ individuals, and how cocaine abuse (CA) affects identified biological networks. With the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and public health strategies to reduce HIV incidence, much of the HIV burden in developed countries is now as a chronic disease, including among drug users. Managing HIV progression (HP) and searching for an HIV cure are of paramount importance. Higher pretreatment VL is associated with HP and is associated with a larger LR. An HIV cure is dependent on eliminating the LR. Cocaine is one of the most frequently abused illicit drugs among HIV+ individuals and is known to increase VL, worsen HP, slow decline of viral production after cART, and, we hypothesize, affect the quantity of LR. Thus, there is a complex web of relationships among VL, LR, and CA, which are partially driven by and mediated through genetic susceptibility and gene regulation. As concluded by Le Cleric et al. (2019) in their recent review: “Only integrative approaches that combine all big data results and consider their complex interactions will allow us to capture the global picture of HIV molecular pathogenesis. This novel challenge will require large collaborative efforts and represents a huge open field for innovative bioinformatics approaches.” We propose Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) as a multi-method, multi-omic framework for discovering and understanding the biology underlying HIV outcomes and the effect of CA. We will apply Explainable Artificial Intelligence, network mapping, and Lines-of-Evidence integration to existing genome-, methylome-, and transcriptome-wide data across a number of cohorts in the following aims:   Aim 1: Identify gene networks underlying variation in HIV VL and LR applying GNetii.   Aim 2: Identify differences in HIV associated gene networks by CA.  This robustly designed study is significant and innovative: targeting key HIV outcomes affected by CA,  applying big data techniques to identify gene networks across multiple omics (enhancing discovery and  biological interpretation), and leveraging unique LR data. Our multiple Principal Investigator team includes  expertise in HIV, drug abuse, and computational biology. Thus, we are likely to produce important new  insights into key elements of HIV as a chronic disease: providing a basis for targeting unique features of CA  that impact VL and LR, which make HIV management and a cure more challenging in this population.

"Secondary Analysis of Cognitive Data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) to Identify Longitudinal Change Phenotypes in HIV+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have modified Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection from a nearly universal fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition, yet associated symptoms like cognitive impairments (CI) persist at a higher rate than in comparable uninfected control populations. These impairments are heterogeneous in terms of presentation (e.g. cognitive domains) and trajectory. Given that domain-specific impairments are likely due to different pathological changes, studies that investigate CI based on a global metric of impairment are likely to miss this. The application of advanced analysis methods, including machine learning to interrogate complex diseases and biological processes, is beginning to transform our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to complex diseases, including CI in the setting of HIV infection. In order to identify and characterize factors that contribute to nonlinear patterns of cognitive change, we propose to capitalize on over 20 years of data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). MACS is one of the largest and longest running studies of men infected with HIV, that includes a substudy with biannual neurocognitive testing that began in 1988. A complete battery of longitudinal neurocognitive testing data is available to us through this cohort, as well as concurrent datasets that include demographic, clinical, psychiatric, lifestyle and biochemical data. The data set consists of over 3500 subjects with over 500,000 data points. In Aim 1, we propose to use data-driven methods (k-means clustering for joint longitudinal trajectories and dynamic time warping) to identify groups of individuals with distinct domain-specific patterns of cognitive change. In Aim 2, we will use the vast amount of data collected on these subjects to identify subtype-specific variables that contribute or predict group membership. By using advanced machine learning methods that are unconstrained by preset statistical or biological assumptions, we are uniquely positioned to identify factors that contribute to longitudinal patterns of change in specific cognitive functions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive changes in HIV can be indicative of varying neuropathological mechanisms of impairment. This project aims to shed light on those mechanisms by analyzing pre-existing data from the MACS cohort to identify groups of HIV infected men with similar cognitive trajectories and then mining the available data to identify risk factors and contributing variables to those trajectories. By using advanced machine-learning methods to analyze non-linear patterns we will provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of domain-specific cognitive declines and may create an iterative framework for precision-based medicine approaches to treat cognitive impairment.",Secondary Analysis of Cognitive Data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) to Identify Longitudinal Change Phenotypes in HIV+ Individuals,10116489,R03MH123290,"['Cohort Effect ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Population Control ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Group Identifications ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Peripheral ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Metabolic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Pathologic ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' data reduction ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' HIV antiretroviral ', ' HIV anti-retroviral ', ' associated symptom ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study ', ' The Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,81875,MD-07
"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,10135718,U01HL146201,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Baltimore ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' cold preservation ', ' cold storage ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.

"Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER Central nervous system (CNS) complications are common among people with HIV (PWH), even those who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). The spectrum of CNS complications is broad, ranging from mild cognitive deficits that do not affect daily functioning to life-threatening encephalitis. Cognitive and mood disorders are among the most common CNS diseases that affect PWH and share a common risk factor, inflammation. Inflammation persists in effectively treated PWH for multiple reasons, including production of HIV RNA and proteins and gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. CHARTER is a multisite, U.S.-based, neuroHIV cohort study that is funded by NIH and that has investigated CNS disorders in PWH for nearly two decades, during which it has completed more than 6,000 assessments generating more than 10 million data points. CHARTER has made important contributions to understanding the frequency, risk factors, and pathogenesis of these disorders. In recent years, new questions have arisen about the heterogeneity, biological basis, clinical impact, and management of CNS disorders. This debate has highlighted the need to create new classifications of CNS disorders in PWH that are more biology-based. We propose to use methods such as machine learning and an agnostic approach to categorize CHARTER’s high-dimensional neurobehavioral, neuromedical, psychiatric, substance use, and imaging data. Such analyses would yield not just cognitive phenotypes but biopsychosocial (BPS) phenotypes that could identify new mechanisms that lead to clinically useful diagnostic tests, new therapies, and better management of CNS disorders in PWH.  Our overarching goal is to leverage prior investment in CHARTER by using its data and stored specimens to a) better understand cognitive and BPS phenotypes in PWH and b) relate them to biological mechanisms. To accomplish this, we will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to analyze data from CHARTER’s comprehensive assessments with the goal of identifying new cognitive and BPS phenotypes (Aim 1). We will then compare these new phenotypes to high-dimensional data from CHARTER’s completed genomewide association study as well as new data we will generate on inflammation (45-plex bead-based array) and highly novel assays of the microbiome and the metabolome in blood and CSF (Aim 2). Our analyses will include a specific focus how sex affects the observed relationships. To determine if this novel approach relates more strongly to biology than prior methods, we will also compare the performance of the new phenotypes to those defined by the 2007 HAND criteria. This highly innovative application is supported by strong preliminary data, responds well to Office of AIDS Research priorities, and will address key gaps in the field, including the need to better understand the pathogenesis of comorbid disease. Cognitive and mood disorders occur more commonly in people with HIV than in the general population but the field still does not fully understand why and has no effective therapies for most of those who are affected. This project will take a new approach to understanding how cognition, mood, substance use, and medical characteristics cluster together and will identify new biological mechanisms associated with these conditions. The successful project could lead to new diagnostic tests and therapies for these disorders, which would have substantial public health relevance.",Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms

"Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Title Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Abstract (30 Lines)  HIV testing jumpstarts the HIV prevention and treatment care continuum. HIV testing levels in men who have sex with men (MSM) and in diverse settings like Malaysia are especially low. MSM increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM has soared to 21.6% in Malaysia, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that lifetime HIV testing is 70.3%, past-year testing is 40.9% and only 9.5% were tested more than once-yearly despite extraordinary levels of self-reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.  Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in these settings are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model of behavioral change is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given the many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality and providing real-time information, motivation and behavioral skills to overcome barriers. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using smartphone apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence using machine learning (AI/ML) may overcome such limitations, but have yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test to assess acceptability and feasibility of an AI/ML-Chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual (control). Findings from this exploratory pilot study will inform a future prospective Type 1 Hybrid implementation science trial. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on developing a chatbot that adapts using machine learning and artificial intelligence to promote HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). Once developed and adequately tested, the new chatbot (TestBot) will be embedded into a social networking app selected by MSM to create a mHealth intervention for MSM to promote real-time HIV testing-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. TestBot will provide culturally-tailored messages to promote HIV testing in MSM that does not rely on intensive human resources to develop and maintain the intervention.",Developing an Artificial

"Neurotrophic Factor Signaling in the Pathogenesis of HIV-associated Depression: Cohort and Mechanistic Studies Abstract Neurotrophic Factor Signaling in the Pathogenesis of HIV-associated Depression: Cohort and Mechanistic Studies Depression in people with HIV is known to worsen HIV outcomes as well as quality of life. Prior studies have shown Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is pivotal in neuron development and maintenance and important in depression. To better understand the pathophysiology of depression in HIV, we desire to use proteomics to further study the BDNF pathways in pre- existing CSF samples from people with HIV and then do a proof-of-concept test in a murine HIV model of depression. We have access to cerebrospinal fluid from a cohort of outpatients with HIV collected in a study of HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders with CSF and clinical data collection at 0 and 2 years. The evaluation included neurocognitive testing and depression screening with the center for epidemiological studies depression (CESD). We plan to do discovery and validation proteomics with focus in the validation proteomics for the BDNF pathway. We will use a machine-learning analysis plan comparing our proteomics findings with the CESD generally and on an item-level basis as well as cognitive evaluations using the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs with focus on Loss, Reward Valuation, and Cognition. We plan to do this analysis first cross-sectionally and then further validate by comparing longitudinally. We hypothesize CSF neurotrophic factor BDNF with neuroinflammatory markers are associated with depressive symptoms; strength of association with depressive symptoms will vary within RDoC domains with persistent neuroinflammation closely tied to ongoing symptoms. We plan to use our findings from proteomics in an HIV murine model of depression with focus on the BDNF pathways. We plan to acquire humanized mice and infect half with HIV. We will evaluate them for depression and then inject half with a BDNF antagonist and evaluate again with standard depression testing. We hypothesize the treated mice to exhibit more signs of depression than untreated mice (less sucrose preference, less social interaction, less immobile time) as BDNF improves resilience and neuroplasticity. Successful completion will yield impactful data on the BDNF pathways and could discover additional targets for treatment of HIV-associated depression. Project Narrative Depression in people with HIV is highly prevalent and causes worse outcomes. We desire to explore the mechanism of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Peptide and related pathways in HIV- associated depression using the RDoC constructs with proteomics and a mouse model.

"Knowledge discovery and machine learning to elucidate the mechanisms of HIV activity and interaction with substance use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY More than 36 million people worldwide are estimated to be living with HIV infection and more than 1.2 million are in the USA. With the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy, the life span of HIV-infected individuals has increased significantly. However, the quality of life of can be compromised owing to a range of cognitive deficits and memory loss, commonly referred to as HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). HIV-infected individuals are more likely to suffer from substance use disorder (SUD), and disproportionately suffer from high all-cause mortality. Drugs of abuse also increase severity of HAND by several potential biological mechanisms. HIV associated cognitive deficiencies in conjunction with SUD decrease engagement in HIV care, which fuels a worsening downward spiral of health status. Despite intensive research, there is no approved therapy for the treatment of HAND and particularly for the combined neurological effects of HIV and drugs of abuse.  We have developed and employed MOLIERE and AGATHA, AI-based literature mining systems that discover novel interactions that potentially contribute to HAND. These systems also prioritize mining results to uncover small molecules that can be tested for anti-HAND therapy. Experimental validation of MOLIERE was achieved; four small molecules predicted by MOLIERE were shown to prevent HIV-Tat and cocaine induced neurotoxicity. AGATHA improved MOLIERE results on a massive retroactive validation and is ready to be deployed for wider searches that now include PubChem. In parallel, our previous efforts querying the Department of Veterans Affairs / Veterans Informatics Network Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) with specific hypotheses have successfully uncovered potential associations of unanticipated modifiers of HIV-associated pathologies.  Collectively, these results led us to the central goal of this proposal to develop and apply an integrative AI-based approach to analyze biomedical datasets and Electronic Health Records to determine new mechanisms of HIV and substanses of abuse interactions, and to discover repurposed drug candidates to be tested for the treatment of HIV-infected SUD patients. This will be accomplished in three Aims. Aim 1 will develop a multidimensional AI-based text mining approach to explore new mechanistic connections between HAND and substanses of abuse. This will generate new knowledge of HAND and SUD interactions, and uncover small molecule and drug candidates that can be tested for activity against the neurotoxic insults caused by HIV and substanses of abuse. Aim 2 will develop and apply advanced machine learning and AI algorithms to explore health records of HIV and SUD patients. The outcome will be the development of the machine learning system to analyze VA data and generate of signals (hypotheses) for medications or medication targets that might have value to experimentally test for repurposing to manage HAND. Aim 3 will prioritize the selected candidates for experimental validation and further clinical development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance: The volume of biomedical research literature and data, and electronic health records is exploding exponentially, making it almost impossible for investigators to query such almost infinite information for new connections that might exploited to improve human health. This application proposes to develop a next generation artificial intelligence-based program to rapidly and efficiently query biomedical and health record information for new, unexplored connections between HIV infection and substanses of abuse comorbidities. These new connections will furthermore be prioritized for those connections that might already have a potential treatment, called drug repurposing.",Knowledge discovery and machine learning to elucidate the mechanisms of HIV activity and interaction with substance use disorder,10348407,R01DA054992,"['Accidents ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amphetamines ', ' Desoxynorephedrin ', ' Phenamine ', ' Phenopromin ', ' dl-Amphetamine ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cocaine ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Manuals ', ' Mining ', ' mortality ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Overdose ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Triage ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' health record ', ' substances of abuse ', ' Substance of Abuse ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Modeling ', ' HAART ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurologic Effect ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' PubChem ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' next generation ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' drug of abuse ', ' abused drug ', ' abused drugs ', ' drug abused ', ' drugs abused ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' public health relevance ', ' drug candidate ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' inquiry-based learning ', ' discovery learning ', ' inquiry-based instruction ', ' clinical development ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multiple data sources ', ' network informatics ', ' drug repurposing ', ' repurposing agent ', ' repurposing medication ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,444085,SC-06
"mHealth Messaging to Motivate Quitline use and Quitting among Persons Living With HIV in Vietnam (M2Q2-HIV) 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We propose M2Q2-HIV [mHealth Messaging to Motivate Quitline use and Quitting among Persons Living with HIV (PLWH) in Vietnam (M2Q2-HIV)], an adaptation of our current computer-tailored smoking cessation intervention in Vietnam. We seek to promote underused government resources for public health (quitline) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) among PLWH in a sustainable manner. The intersection of smoking and HIV/AIDS poses a serious public health threat in Vietnam. Vietnam is dealing with these two challenges with parallel rather than integrated plans. Vietnam currently has 431 outpatient clinics for HIV testing, with 188 clinics providing antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, covered by public insurance. Vietnam has setup telephone “quitline” counseling with trained tobacco treatment specialists who also provide NRT. These clinical (HIV) and public health resources (quitlines) are not connected, reducing both programs’ impact. To connect these resources, we will adapt our current intervention for computer-tailored, text-based smoking cessation in Vietnam to be specific to PLWH smoking behavior, for example, by addressing HIV stigma via developing motivational and tailored messages written by PLWH smokers. To further increase message relevance for PLWH smokers, we will add a computer-tailoring innovation: a machine-learning, collective intelligence system. Companies like Amazon use collective intelligence systems to continuously learn and adapt to user feedback (e.g., pages liked, or products purchased), thus, increasing message relevance. We developed the first collective intelligence system for smokers. Our pilot data indicates that the ability to continuously learn may be even more beneficial for smokers who are less ready to quit, such as like PLWH. We will test M2Q2-HIV by conducting a randomized control trial with 600 PLWH smokers in two provinces in Northern Vietnam (26 clinics; 9,877 HIV patients). In Aim 1, we will conduct formative work to prepare the M2Q2-HIV system for PLWH smokers. In Aim 2, we will randomize and follow smokers for six months. Our effectiveness hypothesis will evaluate carbon monoxide (CO) verified, six- month, seven-day point prevalence cessation. Process hypotheses will evaluate self-efficacy, quitline and NRT use, and test our hypothesized model that specific measured processes will partially mediate observed intervention effectiveness. Using qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and PLWH smokers, Aim 3 will support nationwide M2Q2-HIV dissemination assessing acceptability and contextual factors guided by the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM). This project builds upon a long-standing, successful collaboration between institutions in Vietnam (Ministry of Health, Bach Mai Quitline, Institute of Population Health and Development, Hanoi Medical University) and UMMS. Our team has expertise in smoking cessation, HIV intervention including stigma related to concomitant substance use, and implementation of complex interventions. The Vietnam Ministry of Health is committed to incorporating M2Q2-HIV as a permanent part of the national infrastructure if proven effective.

"Interventions to improve alcohol-related comorbidities along the gut-brain axis in persons with HIV infection As persons living with HIV (PLWH) live longer, approximately 50% will experience HIV-related cognitive dysfunction, which may affect daily activities, contribute to morbidity and mortality, and increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Alcohol consumption among PLWH may further exacerbate long-term cognitive dysfunction, with the presumed mechanism involving the gut microbiome, microbial translocation, systemic inflammation, and ultimately neuroinflammation. However, there are many gaps in our understanding regarding the specific pathophysiological mechanisms, and a need to offer interventions that are effective and acceptable in helping PLWH to reduce drinking or to protect them against alcohol-related harm. The overarching goal of this P01 is to identify and ultimately implement new/improved, targeted interventions that will improve outcomes related to cognitive and brain dysfunction in persons with HIV who drink alcohol. The proposed P01 activity will extend our current line of research that forms the core of the Southern HIV & Alcohol Research Consortium (SHARC). The specific aims of this P01 are to: 1) improve our understanding of the specific mechanisms that connect the gut microbiome to cognitive and brain health outcomes in persons with HIV; 2) evaluate interventions that are intended to reduce the impact of alcohol on brain and cognitive health in persons with HIV; and 3) connect and extend the research activity from this P01 with the training programs and community engagement activity in the SHARC. Our P01 will utilize two cores that provide infrastructure to two Research Components (RC1, RC2). The two RC will together enroll 200 PLWH with at-risk drinking into clinical trials that share common timepoints and outcome assessments. RC1 will compare two strategies to extend contingency management to 60 days, using breathalyzers and wrist-worn biosensors to monitor drinking. RC2 uses a hybrid trial design to evaluate two biomedical interventions targeting the gut-brain axis. One intervention is a wearable, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulator that is hypothesized to stimulate the autonomic nervous system, resulting in decreased inflammation and improved cognition. The other intervention is a probiotic supplement intended to improve the gut microbiome in persons with HIV and alcohol consumption. All participants in RC2, and a subset of those in RC1 will have neuroimaging at two timepoints. The Data Science Core will provide data management and analytical support, and will analyze existing data and the data collected from this P01 using a machine learning and AI approach to identify factors associated with intervention success or failure. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership, clinical research and recruitment infrastructure, and connection to the outstanding training programs, development opportunities, and community engagement provided by the SHARC. Our community engagement with diverse populations, and collection of acceptability data from clinical trial participants, will facilitate our readiness to scale up the most promising interventions and move towards implementation in the next phase of our research. This P01 project has public health significance, because brain and cognitive dysfunction are among the most important health issues encountered by persons living with HIV as they age. Our P01 will evaluate three promising interventions that may improve cognitive functioning among persons with HIV who consume alcohol.",Interventions to improve alcohol-related comorbidities along the gut-brain axis in persons with HIV infection,10304322,P01AA029543,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Feedback ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Inflammation ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity -

"Reconstructing HIV Epidemics from HIV Phylogenetics Project Summary HIV continues to spread, episodically, among minority groups, and mostly from people unaware of their infection. To more efficiently locate undiagnosed people living with HIV for treatment, as well as to monitor prevention efforts, better epidemiological techniques are needed. Our project brings together a team of experienced researchers from clinical, molecular biology, epidemiological, mathematical, and evolutionary fields. We will develop innovative epidemiological methods by combining evolutionary theory, multi-scale dynamic modeling, artificial intelligence, and large-scale clinical and sequence data. In this renewal, we will expand on our previous work on how HIV within-host evolutionary processes interact with epidemiological dynamics. Having quantified the link between transmission history and the resulting HIV phylogeny among hosts, we conceptualize the relationship between the evolution and epidemiology of HIV into three levels: within-host, at transmission, and on the population epidemic level. Because essential processes of HIV biology and evolution have been largely ignored when modeling the epidemic level, in aim 1 we examine within-host processes that affect diversification. We will include recombination, selection, and latency in a new coalescent within-host model to evaluate the impact on the epidemiological level. We will also quantify potential within- host multi-directional selection pressures. In aim 2, we focus on mechanisms that occur around the time of transmission. We will develop a new maximum likelihood method based on a forward-time probabilistic model of transmission that improves the inference of transmission direction and time of transmission among multiple hosts, and develop a transmission heterogeneity detection method to both assess overall possible transmission heterogeneity among infected persons, as well as to detect where in a phylogeny super- spreading may have occurred. In aim 3, we will develop machine learning methods to handle very large data sets (103-106 patients), and use additional clinical and demographic data to augment phylogenies in order to reconstruct the underlying transmission history. All three aims will involve advancements aimed at developing and improving methods for the next generation of phylodynamic applications. Narrative Combining evolutionary theory, multi-scale dynamic modeling, and large-scale clinical and sequence data will transform how epidemics are investigated and prevented.

"The Role of an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot in Social Support, Antiretroviral Adherence, and Depressive Symptoms among Young Adults Living with HIV in South Africa PROJECT SUMMARY Specific Aims: Developing effective interventions to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes among populations disproportionately affected by HIV is a priority for NIH-funded HIV research in 2019. This study will explore the effects and uptake of an artificially intelligent, socially supportive chatbot – a computer that texts with users via mobile phone – among young women and men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV in South Africa. Specifically, the study will (1) develop an online scale to measure social support from a chatbot among young adults; (2) evaluate associations of social support from a chatbot with changes in depressive symptoms and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among young women and YMSM in South Africa; and (3) describe barriers and facilitators to uptake of a chatbot among young women and YMSM in South Africa. Significance: Young South Africans between the ages of 15 to 24 are at high risk of contracting and dying from HIV. Though ART extends life and prevents transmission, many young adults have poor adherence. Research in high-income countries suggest that automated two-way messaging with chatbots improves adherence to health behaviors. Chatbots may also address depressive symptoms and lack of social support, which are consistently identified barriers to adherence. Chatbots are rarely used to improve HIV care in low- and middle-income countries. If this study’s aims are achieved, then (1) future researchers will be able to more accurately measure social support from chatbots; (2) chatbots could potentially be used to promote adherence to medications and increase access to mental health support; and (3) future design and implementation of chatbots to improve HIV care will be optimized. This study’s long-term objective is to generate evidence for an effective, scalable intervention that engages hard-to-reach populations living with HIV. Approach: Aim 1 will develop a scale to measure social support from a chatbot using principal components and exploratory factor analyses applied to data gathered from 1,200 young adults worldwide who use Replika, a freely available mobile application (app). Aims 2 and 3 will invite 160 young women and YMSM living with HIV in Cape Town, South Africa to use the Replika app for four weeks in a pre-post study design. Aim 2 will employ an analysis of covariance using generalized multivariable linear regression models to assess the relationship between feelings of social support from the Replika app and changes in depressive symptoms and ART adherence. Aim 3 will leverage surveys (quantitative) and interviews (qualitative) in a mixed methods study to characterize differences between users with high- and low-frequency engagement with the app. Fellowship Information: This study is the dissertation for Ms. Brooke Jarrett, a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. Her training will consist of research methods and science communication toward her career goal of becoming a researcher of state-of-the-art mobile technologies to improve the physical and mental health of young people affected by health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Though medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can greatly increase life expectancy and prevent new HIV infections, many young adults living with HIV do not adhere to their prescribed daily regimen of medications. Artificially intelligent chatbots – or a computer that texts back-and-forth with users – may be able to promote adherence to health behaviors. This study will explore whether and how chatbots can provide social support, alleviate depressive symptoms, and improve medication adherence among young women and men who have sex with men living with HIV in South Africa.","The Role of an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot in Social Support, Antiretroviral Adherence, and Depressive Symptoms among Young Adults Living with HIV in South Africa",10251005,F31MH121128,"['Affect ', ' Southern Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' South Africa ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' computer human interaction ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' social norm ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Life ', ' posters ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' Underserved Population ', ' under served group ', ' under served people ', ' under served population ', ' underserved group ', ' underserved people ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers PROJECT SUMMARY Rates of new HIV infections are disproportionately high, and uptake of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) low, in Black, Latino, and underinsured individuals in the U.S. Healthcare providers at safety net community health centers (CHCs) provide care to racially diverse populations with high rates of underinsurance. However, providers cite barriers to PrEP prescribing, including lack of tools to identify candidates for PrEP. Without practical tools to help providers identify patients at risk for HIV infection and prescribe PrEP when appropriate, the population-level benefits of PrEP are unlikely to be realized. Electronic clinical decision support using data embedded in patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to fulfill this need. EHRs contain rich data that can help identify patients at high risk of HIV acquisition, including demographics, diagnoses, testing patterns, prescriptions, and social determinants of health. In our prior work, we developed and validated prediction models using EHR data from two large healthcare systems in Massachusetts and California, with patient populations of 1.1 and 4.3 million, to identify patients at high risk for incident HIV. These machine learning models had strong predictive performance, with C-statistics up to 0.91. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a clinical decision support tool that incorporates an HIV risk prediction model can help providers identify patients at high risk for HIV infection and improve PrEP prescribing. Our study setting is a national network of CHCs with 2.8 million patients (OCHIN). We will first tailor our HIV prediction models to this clinic network, and then conduct formative work with providers to inform our development of alerts and additional PrEP decision support tools that will be effective and welcomed. The study team includes experts in HIV, PrEP implementation, predictive analytics, and healthcare delivery in CHCs. Our specific aims are to 1) optimize prediction models that use EHR data to identify potential PrEP candidates in racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse patient populations; 2) explore providers’ perspectives on barriers to PrEP prescribing, and their preferences for PrEP decision support, to inform development of an EHR-based decision support tool for CHCs; and 3) conduct a pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an EHR-based clinical decision support intervention on PrEP-related care in CHCs. We will assess impact on metrics across the PrEP care continuum, including prescriptions, persistence, clinical monitoring, and tests and diagnoses of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This proposal is innovative in its use of predictive analytics and clinical decision support to optimize PrEP. The project is significant because our intervention will be scalable across CHCs nationally and to other healthcare systems with EHRs, and because it addresses the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic by scaling up PrEP in high- incidence settings. The expected outcome is the foundation for a cluster randomized trial to test whether EHR- based decision support for PrEP can prevent new HIV infections in a national network of CHCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scale-up of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key strategy of the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic. However, healthcare providers lack tools to identify patients who are at increased risk for HIV infection and thus potential candidates for PrEP. This research will lay essential groundwork for a full-scale study to test whether integrating automated tools into electronic health records to help providers identify potential candidates for PrEP can improve PrEP prescribing and prevent new HIV infections in community health centers.",EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers,10070648,R34MH122291,"['Anatomy ',

"Forecasting trajectories of HIV transmission networks with a novel phylodynamic and deep learning framework SUMMARY Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy, the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention and intervention strategies designed to reduce significantly both prevalence and incidence worldwide. In order to achieve the 2020 UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal (90% of people living with HIV diagnosed, 90% of people diagnosed to be on sustained antiretroviral treatment, and 90% of people on treatment to maintain viral suppression), it is necessary to develop innovative tools that can be used for predicting the growth and trajectory of localized sub-epidemics driven by specific transmission clusters. Phylodynamic analysis has extensively been used in the HIV field to track the origin and reconstruct the virus demographic history both at local, regional and global level. However, such studies have been so far only retrospective, with little or no power to make predictions about future epidemic trends. The overarching goal of the prosed project is to develop an innovative computational framework coupling phylodynamic inference and behavioral network data with artificial intelligence algorithms capable of predicting HIV transmission clusters future trajectory, and informing on key determinants of new infections. We propose to achieve this goal by carrying out three specific aims: 1. Develop a phylodynamic-based PRIDE module to forecast HIV infection hotspots [the infected]; 2. Develop a behavioral network-based PRIDE module for risk of HIV infection [the uninfected], and 3. Carry out focus groups for deploying the new PRIDE forecasting technology into public health, and implement prevention through the peer change agent model. In particular, through a close partnership with the Florida Department of Health (FLDoH), we will analyze existing databases that the FLDoH has assembled over the past twelve years including extensive HIV molecular sequence, clinical and behavioral network data. Florida had an HIV case rate of 24.0 per 100,000 people in 2016, and it is currently the third state in the USA in terms of yearly incidence. Our partnership with the FLDoH will ensure that the results of the proposed research will be used to curtail the HIV epidemic by optimizing public health based surveillance programs, informing targeted intervention strategies, and implementing more effective prevention measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE / PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention strategies designed to reduce significantly incidence worldwide.

"uTECH: Machine Learning for HIV Prevention Among Substance Using GBMSM Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV in the U.S. Substance use is an important influence on HIV risk among GBMSM; and partner seeking for both sex and substance use have largely moved online and to geosocial networking platforms designed for GBMSM (e.g., Grindr). Technological advances in the collection and mining of “big data” to inform behavioral health interventions have increased in recent years but have not been applied directly to HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction among GBMSM. At the same time, despite major advances in biomedical HIV prevention (i.e., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) and substance use harm-reduction (i.e., medication assisted therapy [MAT]), these strategies are underutilized by GBMSM. My research team and I conducted formative research on social media data mining and machine learning through a NIDA A/START (R03) to identify patterns of technology use that are associated with HIV risk and substance use among GBMSM. We established computational functionality of a culturally tailored social media data mining program among substance using GBMSM. I now take an important scientific risk to use this technology to develop an HIV prevention intervention for GBMSM, tentatively titled uTECH, that leverages insights from machine learning to trigger personalized intervention content in order to increase biomedical HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction. Specifically, I propose to conduct a two-phase study. In Phase 1 I will conduct qualitative interviews with GBMSM to inform the iterative development and refinement of uTECH. In Phase 2, I will test the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of uTECH in a comparative implementation science trial. For this phase, I will (a) enroll racially diverse, HIV- negative, substance using GBMSM; (b) randomize them to either the uTECH intervention or a comparison group; and (c) measure acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility through 6 months post-intervention. My primary implementation science outcomes will be acceptability (i.e., Acceptability of Intervention Measure [AIM]), appropriateness (i.e., Intervention Appropriateness Measure [IAM]), and feasibility (i.e., Feasibility of Intervention Measure [FIM]). I believe that the power of “big data” and new technologies can be harnessed for effective HIV prevention with substance using GBMSM. In the era of increasing HIV prevention fatigue among GBMSM, the ability to deliver quick, convenient and highly personalized interventions presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and substance use is an important factor driving new HIV infections in this population.

"A machine learning framework for understanding impacts on the HIV latent reservoir size, including drugs of abuse The major obstacle to curing HIV infection is a durable and persistent latent reservoir of infected cells. The latent HIV reservoir is not eliminated by antiretroviral therapy (ART), and ART interruption results in uncontrolled virus rebound within weeks. Despite the importance of this reservoir, little is known about the biological parameters that influence it, or the effects of recreational drug use on it. While the size of the HIV reservoir is fairly stable within individuals, it varies greatly (up to 1000-fold) between individuals, suggesting that host factors influence its size. These factors likely include a complex set of genes, transcriptional pathways, immune cell populations, and environmental influences, including drugs of abuse. Cannabinoid (CB) use, in particular, is prevalent amongst persons with HIV (PWH) with up to 49% PWH reporting regular use. However, the impact of CBs on the HIV reservoir has not been fully investigated. CBs have immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory activities through activation of the CB2 receptor that is widely expressed in immune cells, including CD4 T cells that harbor most of the HIV reservoir. Our hypothesis is that CB interacts with host pathways and factors that impact the size of the HIV reservoir. Due to the complex nature of the interaction of CB with the host immune system, new computational tools are required lo achieve a deep understanding of how CB impacts both the host immune system and the HIV reservoir. Our goal is to develop a novel framework for heterogeneous data integration, including new tools for dimension reduction and interpretable machine learning, and apply it to data from three HIV cohort studies (US-UNC, Switzerland, and US-Duke). This approach will reveal relationships between host characteristics and HIV reservoir size, both in the presence and absence of CB use. In Aim 1, we develop dimension reduction {DR) tools, with application to heterogeneous data from the US-UNC PWH cohort. In Aim 2, we develop a new powerful interpretable machine technique - alternating decision trees (adtrees) - and apply it to data from a large PWH Swiss cohort study to reveal factors that determine HIV reservoir size. In Aim 3, both tools will be applied to data from a unique cohort of CB-using PWH at Duke University, to explain the effects of cannabis on the immune system of PWH and on the latent HIV reservoir. Project Narrative Our goal is to develop a novel framework for heterogeneous data integration, including new tools for dimension reduction and interpretable machine learning.

"Combinatorial and computational design of bnAb mRNA vaccines for HIV Many HIV vaccine candidates have failed clinical trials, as they were unable to elicit a potent and durable response to HIV viral challenge. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been identified in a number of HIV+ individuals with well-controlled viral levels, and these bnAbs target epitopes that contain residues that are relatively conserved across viral strains. It is thought bnAbs may have efficacy against various strains of HIV pathogen. It is therefore widely believed that systems which induce a potent immune response that includes the generation of broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) in humans could be effective HIV vaccines, and help to mitigate the wide genetic diversity in envelope proteins and relatively high mutation rate of HIV. However, developing a vaccine which can elicit the production of these bnAbs in vivo has proven to be extremely challenging. This is likely due to the complex affinity maturation process that is required to produce bnAbs. Immunization protocols typically administer a single dose of antigen (prime dose), which is sometimes followed by a “boost” dose delivered several weeks later. In a traditional bolus immunization, the half-life of the antigen present in lymph nodes is generally shorter than the time scale over which germinal centres start producing higher affinity IgG antibodies relative to the initial IgM response (~18 hrs). In contrast, natural infections expose the immune system to escalating antigen and inflammation over days to weeks, resulting in the formation of a germinal centre with dynamic antigen presentation. This germinal centre niche also supports activation of antigen presenting cells, T follicular helper cells, and appropriate cytokine signalling to generate bnAbs. It is likely that to develop effective bnAbs, sophisticated vaccination techniques which can more closely mimic natural infections and natural bnAb formation may be required. We believe that to develop a successful HIV vaccine, researchers must aim to engineer more sophisticated and biomimetic vaccines. Bioengineered vaccines should therefore consider three key parameters in parallel; 1) delivery of an appropriately selected antigen, with 2) favourable kinetics of antigen expression, and 3) control of the immune response in the germinal centre. We believe lymph node targeted delivery of computationally designed mRNA antigens inside immunostimulatory lipid nanoparticles (mRNA LNPs) administered with computationally optimized immunization protocols will address these three aspects in a unique way. Additionally,Translate Bio will provide expertise in manufacturing considerations for mRNA therapeutics. As modifications to mRNA structure may impact the mRNA antigen translation, stability, and immunogenicity, the input of our translational partner (Translate Bio) will allow us to develop vaccines with a potential avenue for commercial development. This R61/R33 proposal combines our expertise in computational antigen design, HIV immunology, combinatorial chemistry, and the commercialisation of mRNA therapeutics to develop a new class of HIV mRNA vaccine candidates. HIV remains a global pandemic with no effective vaccine. Here we propose to combine computational and experimental methods to develop an mRNA nanovaccine which produces broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV, by engineering antigen composition, mRNA structure, and immunostimulating mRNA nanoformulations for enhanced immunity.",Combinatorial and computational design of bnAb mRNA vaccines for HIV,10237019,R61AI161805,"['Antibodies ', '

"Targeted Learning using adaptive designs for HIV Epidemic control in East Africa PROJECT SUMMARY Scientific approaches to detect and respond to gaps in the public health response to HIV face a broad challenge with profound implications: after more than a decade of intensive service scale-up, the magnitude and reasons for remaining gaps in the treatment and prevention cascades differ markedly across people, communities, organizations, and geographies. As a result, strategies to control the epidemic must efficiently identify people and places most in need of intensified HIV testing, prevention, and treatment support, and deliver to each a timely and effective intervention. This poses a distinct scientific task: methods are required to discover and leverage continually evolving information to optimize “local” estimates of how best to allocate limited resources for both measurement and intervention. To meet this need, we propose a set of theoretical and applied aims that advance the use of adaptive designs– i.e. repeated “learn-and- apply” cycles– as a strategic approach for implementation science in heterogenous environments. Our approach uses four steps. First, we will extend existing statistical theory to allow machine learning to direct ongoing adaptation in who to measure and how to intervene, thereby creating approaches that maximally leverage the increasingly rich program data available in the HIV epidemic response. Second, we will use existing data from several unique field studies to create “virtual laboratories” for method validation and evaluation: 1) a sampling study to assess mortality on treatment in 64 facilities and 165,000 patients in Zambia; 2) an 1800-person individually randomized trial to optimize retention in HIV treatment in Kenya; and, 3) a cluster randomized trial of HIV treatment as prevention in 32 communities and 150,000 adults in Kenya and Uganda. Third, we will use these data to compare the methods developed against benchmarks provided by standard approaches (e.g. fixed sampling or balanced randomization). Fourth, we will develop accessible software for several general classes of problems in the HIV epidemic response and implementation science more broadly. Aim 1 seeks to develop and evaluate adaptive sampling designs that target data gathering based on past information to better detect locations and subpopulations with elevated risk. Aim 2 seeks to develop and evaluate adaptive designs that continuously target intervention assignment to learn how best to distribute interventions with heterogeneous effects. Aim 3 seeks to develop and evaluate adaptive strategies that use past data to target combined data gathering and public health interventions to simultaneously discover regions of elevated risk and guide intervention decisions. Overall these methods offer the promise of detecting gaps in the HIV response more quickly, with fewer resources, and with fewer “missed signals”, and of intervening more effectively within a context of constrained resources by assigning interventions better tailored to individual and context-specific needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the current HIV epidemic response, high variability in implementing contexts and epidemic settings demands epidemiological designs and analytic methods that are able to detect and respond to heterogeneity effectively and efficiently. We propose a series of aims that leverage the rich data increasingly generated in the course of the HIV epidemic response, and apply targeted machine learning to advance adaptive design and analytic approaches. For each aim, we: 1) propose theoretical advancements to current adaptive design methods; 2) use large-scale contemporary data from the HIV epidemic in East Africa to build virtual analytic laboratories; 3) test the performance of the proposed innovations in these settings; and, 4) develop statistical software that can be implemented by applied epidemiologists to address real world problems.",Targeted Learning using adaptive designs for HIV Epidemic control in East Africa,10236261,R01AI074345,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Africa ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Geography ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Uganda ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Services ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' community organizations ', ' implementation science ', ' effective intervention ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' public health intervention ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' trial design ', ' virtual laboratory ', ' remote laboratory ', ' virtual lab ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' implementation strategy ', ' strategies for implementation ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' treatment as prevention ', ' treatment-based prevention ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,566402,CA-13
"MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to “characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use” and “[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery” [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI. Public Health Relevance  Nearly half of HIV-infected Americans experience neurocognitive impairments that impact daily functioning, and the prevalence is even higher among persons who are addicted to stimulant drugs. Using innovative multimodal data fusion approaches, this study will identify the distinct and shared neural signatures of HIV neurological disease and cocaine use disorder that are predictive of neurocognitive impairment. Capitalizing on existing datasets, this project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments in active drug users.",MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications,10086974,R01DA045565,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Arizona ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cocaine ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' indexing ', ' Joints ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' data quality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' PWUD ', ' people who use drugs ', ' people who use illicit drugs ', ' persons who use drugs ', ' Drug user ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' prevention service ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology -

"Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60 The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next year, they will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors along, the likelihood for delayed diagnosis of early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological testing and structural imaging. In this application, we will use a new approach that leverages computational machine learning with inputs from structural imaging, neuropsychological testing, motor examination and affective/behavioral assessments to determine the factors that most accurately discriminate HAND from MCI-AD. Our preliminary examinations using this novel technique demonstrate a likelihood that this approach will provide diagnostic sorting that exceeds 90% accuracy. We will examine tightly characterized phenotypes using HIV tests to exclude HAND and PET amyloid scanning to exclude AD among 75 HIV+/amyloid marker negative participants with HAND to 50 HIV-negative/amyloid+ cases with MCI (MCI-AD group), all age, sex and disease severity matched and all over age 60, the population of interest due to dual risk. Our methodology will iterate the most distinctive aspects of each disease's phenotype to inform sorting and subsequently, guidelines. We will validate the identified inputs that most clearly contribute to the algorithm though clinical correlations and through the ability of the determined clusters (e.g. diagnostic group) to predict the meaningful outcomes of disease progression. The long-term goal of this work is to inform clinical guidelines, thus, the modalities examined are readily available in clinical care. This work will also extend our understanding of neuropathology in older HIV patients and may identify factors that shift paradigms because our novel approach does not rely on a priori assumptions to inform neuropsychological abnormalities and brain structural alterations linked to HAND in older age. In an exploratory aim, we extend this examination of HAND neuropathogenesis with the added examination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a monocyte associated inflammatory marker, soluable CD163 (sCD163), two measures tightly linked to HAND in published work among virally suppressed patients in the current era. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will examine how clinicians can determine if older patients with HIV are also suffering from early Alzheimer's disease (AD). With patients now living into age ranges where both diseases become possible, guidance on how to distinguish impairment due to HIV from the early stages of AD is critically needed.",Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60,10086888,R01MH113406,"['Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors ', ' acetylcholineesterase inhibition ', ' acetylcholineesterase inhibitor ', ' Affective Symptoms ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Modality ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza Vaccine Response It is estimated that approximately half of HIV-infected individuals in the United States are over 50 years of age. Aging of the HIV-infected population has linked alterations in immune responses associated with age and the immunologic consequences of chronic HIV infection. This intersection of HIV and aging will influence host defense against infection and response to vaccines. As a result, understanding the nexus of HIV-associated immune activation and immunosenescence takes on particular urgency. We will leverage insights from our published and ongoing studies on the effects of aging on dysregulated innate immune pattern recognition receptor (PRR) function, a novel population of pro-inflammatory IL-7 receptor alow effector memory (EM) CD8 T cells that are expanded in HIV-negative older adults, and on expansion of EM CD8 T cells in older HIV-positive adults. We have also elucidated gene expression and immunologic signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older HIV-negative adults. These findings position us to illuminate the effects of aging and HIV infection on innate and adaptive immune function, particularly following influenza vaccination. To address these questions, we have assembled an interdisciplinary group of investigators with expertise in the study of aging of the innate and adaptive human immune systems, and in HIV immunology, biology and clinical care. Our overarching hypothesis is that the pro-inflammatory environment associated with age and with suppressed HIV infection potentiates immunosenescence in older adults with HIV disease. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll young (age 21-35) and older (age over 65) adults with HIV infection receiving high-dose influenza vaccine. We will employ state of the art methods including multichannel mass cytometry on whole blood to assess development and activation of major populations (e.g. monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils), including novel studies of platelets pre- and post-vaccine. We will evaluate innate immune PRR function (including Toll-like and NOD-like receptor family members), where we previously found age-associated alterations in cytokine production and costimulatory protein expression that were related to influenza vaccine response. We will also study T cell responses to in vitro vaccine antigen stimulation, including the IL-7 receptor alow EM CD8 T cell subset. Statistical modeling will include clinical and functional covariates (e.g. CD4+ T cell count, estimated duration of HIV disease and of ART, medical co-morbidities, medication use, functional status). Finally, we will derive gene expression signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older adults with HIV disease, and compare these to those we previously identified in HIV-negative adults. We will employ state of the art analytic methods to integrate gene expression and immunologic data to obtain a comprehensive view of the human immune response in the context of age and immune suppression. These studies ultimately are aimed at identifying pathways amenable to pharmacologic targeting to improve immune and vaccine responses in older (and young) adults with HIV disease. The proposed studies focus on understanding how aging and HIV infection affect the function of the immune system, particularly in response to influenza vaccination, to identify cell types and biologic

"A Machine Learning Health System to Integrate Care for Substance Misuse and HIV Treatment and Prevention among Hospitalized Patients ABSTRACT Substance misuse (SM) puts persons at risk for HIV. Systems of care for the detection and treatment of risks for HIV acquisition or transmission among SM populations are siloed. The acute-care, hospital setting offers unique opportunities for screening, testing, and treatment of HIV risks among patients with SM. Adjacent to communities with the highest number of heroin overdoses in Chicago, Rush University Medical Center launched the Substance Use Intervention Team (SUIT) in 2017. The SUIT service attempts to screen all hospitalized patients for SM and intervenes with a harm reduction model based on low, medium, and high risk; however, the busy setting and acuity and severity of patients’ illnesses limit universal screening rates and facilitate implicit biases in making determinations about which patients to screen. Automated, clinical decision support tools trained with supervised machine learning (ML) can relieve these screening burdens. A machine learning health system approach leverages EHR data, including clinical, social, and behavioral determinants captured in structured data fields and in clinical notes – unstructured data typically unavailable for predictive analytics. A ML HIV risk classifier can identify patients with SM and HIV risk and alert providers to evaluate appropriateness for medication and care to prevent or treat HIV. To date, no screening tool has been developed and validated to assess for HIV risk among persons with SM. This pilot’s goal is to develop, train, and test an interoperable ML classifier to identify risk for HIV transmission or acquisition among patients with SM and assess its real-time performance. Aim 1 is to develop, train, and test a ML classifier with high sensitivity (≥0.8) and specificity (≥0.8) to identify risk for HIV acquisition or transmission among patients with substance misuse. Within the source cohort of encounter-level data of patients with SM between 2017-2019 (N=23,817), we will use a rule-based method and Centers for Disease Control HIV risk guidelines to identify as cases those patient encounters with diagnoses, such as Chlamydia, associated with HIV transmission (6%, n=1,300). Utilizing propensity score matching we will match non-cases (1:2) and conduct manual chart annotation in order to verify or re-classify cases and non-cases and to establish the reference dataset (n=3,900). With labeled cases and non-cases, we will partition the reference dataset to train and test three supervised learning ML models. We will select the best performing model based on standard metrics, like the C-statistic. Aim 2 is to integrate the best performing model from Aim 1 into the Rush EHR infrastructure to test predictive validity in real time, prospectively. As we expect the ML classifier to identify 50% more HIV risk cases (9-10%) than our rule-based method, we will study the effects of the classifier and measure the number of risk cases identified over 12 one-month time points in an interrupted time series. This ML classifier is the first step toward an appropriate, scalable, and interoperable learning health system intervention that integrates HIV prevention and treatments into care for hospitalized patients with SM. PROJECT NARRATIVE This pilot proposes to develop, train, and test a ML classifier to identify risk for HIV acquisition or transmission among hospitalized patients with substance misuse and assess its real-time performance. Within our health system, the tool will reduce screening burdens and enhance our addiction medicine consultation service rooted in harm reduction, expanding HIV prevention and treatment delivery to hard-to-reach populations, such as persons who inject drugs. Across health systems, this tool may have population-level impact as it facilitates an interoperable and scalable intervention to integrate HIV prevention at the point of care.",A Machine Learning Health System to Integrate Care for Substance Misuse and HIV Treatment and Prevention among Hospitalized Patients,10288732,R21HS028511,[''],AHRQ,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,149230,IL-07
"Improved analysis of experiments and observational studies in HIV ABSTRACT More robust and accurate health knowledge is a cornerstone of better health policy and action. There are tough questions in HIV that can be addressed better with new quantitative tools. Results from experimental and observational HIV studies can be made better and more policy-relevant through development and use of new methods at the interface of statistics, epidemiology, causal inference, and artificial intelligence. An innovative combination of semiparametric statistical theory, causal models, and ensemble machine learning provides a unique opportunity for better results from HIV studies. In this work, we propose new estimators of the risk (or survival) function. These new estimators improve accuracy, accommodate competing events, allow effects to be generalized to specific populations of interest, incorporate machine learning of nuisance functions to relax assumptions about model form, and allow sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact of uncontrolled biases. The specific aims are vehicles to develop, test, and disseminate these new estimators. These aims are to 1) estimate the long-term treated history of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in this large US cohort of women with HIV; 2) estimate the observational analog of the per-protocol parameter using a treatment decision design to compare composite endpoints under an integrase-inhibitor-based treatment compared to an efavirenz-based treatment in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design; 3) estimate the per-protocol parameter for TDF-FTC versus ABC-3TC arms; and 4) estimate the per- protocol parameter for 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate versus masked placebo on risk of preterm birth in Zambian HIV+ pregnant women. The assembled team features field-leading expertise in epidemiology, statistics, and HIV medicine. Scientific products will include publications and workshop presentations describing new methodological approaches and new substantive findings that emerge after applying the proposed methods to each of the problems identified in the specific aims. We will also produce publicly available R packages and SAS macros to implement the proposed estimators.

"Developing an artificial intelligence-based mHealth intervention to increase HIV testing in Malaysia Project Summary  HIV testing jumpstarts entry into the HIV prevention and treatment cascade. HIV testing levels, however, are especially low in men who have sex with men (MSM), who increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM in Malaysia has soared to 21.6% nationally, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that ever tested is 70.3%, past- year tested is 40.9%, and only 9.5% were tested more than 1 time per year, despite extraordinary levels of self- reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.  Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in Malaysia are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given that there are many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using social-networking apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) may overcome such limitations, but has yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test an AI-chatbot (R21 phase). Findings from the R21 phase will inform a Type 1 Hybrid Implementation Science trial (R33 phase) to evaluate the efficacy and implementation outcomes of the AI-chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on developing a chatbot that using artificial intelligence to promote HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (My). Once developed and adequately tested, the new chatbot (named MyTestBot?) will be embedded into a social networking app selected by MSM to create an mHealth intervention to provide MSM with real-time HIV testing-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. MyTestBot? will provide culturally tailored messages to promote HIV testing in MSM that does not rely on intensive human resources to develop and maintain.",Developing an artificial intelligence-based

"Developing a risk assessment tool to identify HIV-uninfected adolescent girls and young women at highest risk for HIV infection: a key step for targeted biomedical HIV prevention PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) 15-24 years of age remain at epicenter of the HIV epidemic, with more than 270,000 new HIV infections each year. Biomedical HIV prevention strategies like tenofovir-based oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are promising measures for reducing HIV acquisition in AGYW. However, providing PrEP to all 100 million AGYW in SSA is not feasible, economical, or necessary, as the risk of HIV acquisition among AGYW is not uniformly high. Risk assessment tools are needed to identify those AGYW sub-populations at greatest risk for acquiring HIV in order to support targeted PrEP program implementation. Existing risk assessment tools for HIV incidence in AGYW have had important limitations surrounding feasibility, validity, and generalizability. The primary goal of this project is to develop a regional risk assessment tool for AGYW that is feasible to implement, valid, and generalizable. Our overarching premise is that risk of HIV acquisition among AGYW is not uniform and it is possible to identify high risk AGYW at a regional level. Aims and Methods: Using nationally representative data from 13 African countries collected as part of the Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) initiative, our team will address this premise through three specific aims. In the first aim, we will explore risk factors associated with recent HIV infection, a marker of incident HIV, among AGYW. Recent infection is defined in the PHIA data using a well-established testing algorithm. Using data from 13 PHIA surveys from 2015-2019, which include >50,000 observations, individual, structural, household, and epidemiologic predictors of recent HIV infection among AGYW will be identified. In the second aim, we will use the candidate predictors from the first aim to develop and internally validate a risk assessment tool to identify AGYW at highest risk of HIV acquisition. In the third aim, we will externally validate the risk assessment tool in five second-round PHIA surveys from 2020. Team: The team, led by an early-career Principal Investigator, has expertise in HIV prevention for AGYW, biomedical HIV prevention, risk score development, and advanced methods for complex survey data. The team is supported by a technical advisory panel of experts from multiple SSA regions. Expected Impact: These findings will provide an in-depth understanding of the current transmission dynamics of HIV among AGYW in SSA. At the end of the study, we expect to have a validated clinical risk assessment tool that can be applied to a range of SSA settings. Such a tool has the potential to transform the clinical delivery of PrEP and other biomedical HIV prevention strategies in SSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young women 15-24 years old are at high risk for HIV acquisition in Sub-Saharan Africa.

"Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and Methamphetamine PROJECT SUMMARY Methamphetamine (METH) is commonly abused and is a risk factor for HIV. METH also increases risk for adverse outcomes during HIV, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Multiple studies have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of METH and HIV on brain structure and function, as well as neurobehavioral and functional performance. Biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury and resilience would be valuable tools for understanding the METH- and HIV-associated pathogenesis and could provide valuable insights for drug development. The effects of METH and HIV outside the CNS (e.g., vascular and metabolic disease) are also important to consider and are a key gap in the field. Another key gap in the field is the translation of research findings to the clinic, including biomarkers that may be used to detect METH- and HIV-associated CNS injury and functional impairment across disease stages. Even less is known about biomarkers of resilience of the host defense mechanisms. Thus, in response to RFA-DA-18-023, this project proposes to screen a comprehensive panel of clinical and research biomarkers reflective of pathology and resilience with the goal of identifying and validating biosignatures that may improve the clinical assessment and diagnosis of brain and peripheral complications associated with METH and HIV. To accomplish this, we propose to leverage NIDA’s prior investment in UCSD’s NIDA-funded Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which performed standardized neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and neuromedical assessments of participants who differed by METH use and HIV infection. We will recall and comprehensively re-assess 200 of these participants. Neuroimaging methods will include measures of cerebral blood flow, CNS metabolite levels, and a novel neuroimaging measure to estimate integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will measure a comprehensive biomarker panel in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool samples, in specimens from their prior baseline visit, which are stored, and from their new visit and then analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches as well as novel techniques rooted in machine-learning and causal inference modeling. This approach will provide unique longitudinal data that will allow for the identification of biosignatures that predict changes in CNS injury and resilience. We will validate the observed biosignatures in an independent cohort of 100 participants who have been previously assessed at UCSD’s HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program and who have comprehensive data and stored specimens (e.g., CSF) available. To better respond to the clinical translation objective of the RFA, we will also compare measured biomarkers to data that are obtained during routine clinic assessments with the goal of identifying a clinical biosignature of METH- and HIV-related CNS injury. A thorough understanding of the impact of METH and HIV on systemic and CNS processes will address key gaps in the field. This insight should also inform the development of assays to inform diagnosis and effective disease and treatment monitoring. PROJECT NARRATIVE    Methamphetamine (METH) is one of the most commonly abused drugs by persons at risk for or living with HIV  disease  and  both  METH  and  HIV  can  have  substantial  adverse
