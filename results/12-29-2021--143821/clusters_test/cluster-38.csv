"14/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,10126842,F31DK121436,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Diabetic Ketoacidosis ', ' Diabetic Acidosis ', ' Diabetic Ketosis ', ' diabetic ketoacidotic ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exercise ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' injection therapy ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Menstruation ', ' Menses ', ' menstrual period ', ' monthly period ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Medical Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Weight ', ' Assimilations ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Failure ', ' Trust ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' tool ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' computer science ', ' glucose uptake ', ' novel ', ' Study Subject ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Erythrocyte/Hepatoma Glucose Transporter ', ' GLUT ', ' GLUT1 ', ' Glucose Transporter 1 ', ' SLC2A1 ', ' Solute Carrier Family 2, Facilitated Glucose Transporter, Member 1 ', ' SLC2A1 gene ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Exercise Physiology ', ' Modification ', ' Tracer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' glucose disposal ', ' insulin stimulated glucose disposal ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' e-commerce ', ' ecommerce ', ' internet commerce ', ' usability ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' Regimen ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' support tools ', ' exercise intensity ', ' resistance exercise ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Injections ', ' euglycemia ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,51036,OR-03
"Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis Abstract Nearly 40% of patients develop diabetes after an initial episode of acute pancreatitis (AP). Various studies have evaluated risk factors for the development of diabetes but they have shown inconsistent findings, suggesting methodologic shortcomings. The present proposal consists of three specific aims where we will attempt to determine the biochemical, radiologic and clinical factors related to the development of diabetes after AP. Aim 1: To identify autoantibodies associated with the progression of type 1 diabetes in patients after AP using a large human proteome array. Aim 2: To study the role of imaging, more specifically quantitative textural analysis to predict the development of type 1 diabetes after AP. Aim 3 is to build a machine learning model to predict type 1 diabetes after AP using patient-related risk factors, textural analysis on imaging and autoantibodies involved in disease progression. Our proposal will help us better understand diabetes after AP. Successful completion of this study has the potential to improve management for AP. Project Narrative Relevance to Public Health Statement Acute pancreatitis is increasing in incidence and can lead to diabetes in some patients. Diabetes is a morbid disease. We plan to study both established and novel risk factors for developing diabetes in patients with acute pancreatitis.","Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis",10264897,U01DK127400,"['acute pancreatitis ', ' Antibodies ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Autoantigens ', ' Autologous Antigens ', ' Self-Antigens ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Responses ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Future ', ' Glucagon ', ' Antidiabetic Hormone ', ' Glukagon ', ' HG-Factor ', ' Hyperglycemic-Glycogenolytic Factor ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Incidence ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreatic Diseases ', ' Pancreatic Disorder ', ' pancreas disorder ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Total Pancreatectomy ', ' pancreas total excision ', ' Autologous Transplantation ', ' Autograft ', ' Autotransplant ', ' autologous graft ', ' autotransplantation ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serology ', ' Biochemical ', ' Autoimmune Diabetes ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis ', ' pancreatitis necrotizing ', ' impaired glucose tolerance ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Visceral ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' model development ', ' Organ failure ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' β-cell ', ' β-cells ', ' βCell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' systematic review ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' islet ', ' Diabetes autoantibodies ', ' diabetic Autoantibodies ', ' Impairment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical risk ', ' nutrient absorption ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' radiomics ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,286563,MD-07
"Enabling Fully Automated Closed Loop Control in Type 1 Diabetes Through an Artificial Intelligence Meal Detection Algorithm and Pramlintide Summary People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have autoimmune destruction of beta cells resulting in insufficient insulin to maintain normal glucose levels, thereby requiring exogenous insulin treatment, typically delivered subcutaneously either continuously infused through an insulin pump or by injection multiple times throughout the day. There are now commercial closed loop systems available that enable automated delivery of fast- acting insulin in response to wireless continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors that inform an automated control algorithm to calculate and deliver insulin via a pump. Unfortunately, current commercial closed loop systems are hybrid systems that require users to announce meals to the system, and these hybrid systems do not control glucose well following meals. People oftentimes forget to announce their meals or misestimate their carbohydrate intake, thereby leading to poor overall postprandial glucose control. The primary benefit of hybrid closed loop systems has been during the overnight period when meals are not consumed. In a normal working beta cell, the hormone amylin is co-secreted with insulin in response to meals to help suppress glucagon production and delay gastric emptying, thereby reducing postprandial glucose increases. Pramlintide is an analog of the endogenous hormone amylin. Our commercial partner, Adocia, has developed a coformulation of insulin and pramlintide. In this project, we will develop a dual hormone (insulin and pramlintide), fully automated closed loop system with a meal detection algorithm that will enable substantial improvements in postprandial glycemic control for people with T1D while minimizing patient burden by not requiring a meal announcement to the system. Our group has previously developed a multi hormone closed loop system (insulin and glucagon) and we have developed models of insulin, pramlintide, glucagon, and carbohydrate kinetics and dynamics that will be integrated into a new insulin+pramlintide closed loop model predictive control (MPC) system (Aim 1). We have also developed a meal detection algorithm that will be integrated with this MPC control algorithm to dose insulin and pramlintide shortly after a meal is detected, thereby eliminating the need for the user to announce this meal to the system (Aim 1). We will use our in silico simulator of glucose metabolism to identify the optimal dosing amount and timing when insulin and pramlintide are delivered in response to the meal detection algorithm (Aim 1). Next, we will evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapies identified in Aim 1 and evaluate the top 4 strategies during an in-clinic meal test in a 4-arm randomized crossover study in 14 people with T1D (Study 1a, Aim 2). We will then evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapy identified in Study 1a and compare with various insulin-only hybrid and automated therapies in an in-clinic randomized crossover study (Study 1b, Aim2). Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapy determined in Aim 2 and compare it with the Tandem Diabetes Control-IQ commercial hybrid closed loop system. Narrative People with type 1 diabetes have difficulty managing their glucose levels, especially during the daytime in response to carbohydrate intake; persistently elevated glucose levels can lead to dangerous, poor overall health outcomes including retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. We will develop a new dual hormone (insulin and pramlintide), fully automated closed loop system that can automatically detect meals and dose in response to these meals. By combining the slowed gastric emptying and suppression of endogenous glucose production that pramlintide provides with a meal detection algorithm, we expect to translate a fully automated closed loop system with minimal patient burden that can achieve substantial improvements in glycemic control both during the evening and during the day.",Enabling Fully Automated Closed Loop Control in Type 1 Diabetes Through an Artificial Intelligence Meal Detection Algorithm and Pramlintide,10276661,R01DK129382,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Gastric Emptying ', ' stomach emptying ', ' Glucagon ', ' Antidiabetic Hormone ', ' Glukagon ', ' HG-Factor ', ' Hyperglycemic-Glycogenolytic Factor ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Nausea ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' islet amyloid polypeptide ', ' Insulinoma amyloid peptide ', ' amlintide ', ' amylin ', ' diabetes associated peptide ', ' insulinoma amyloid polypeptide ', ' pancreatic amylin ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Insulin, Aspart, Human ', ' B28Asp ', ' insulin B28Asp ', ' insulin aspart ', ' Cross-Over Studies ', ' Crossover Studies ', ' Gastroparesis ', ' Gastric Stasis ', ' delayed gastric emptying ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' analog ', ' carbohydrate metabolism ', ' Metabolic ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Pramlintide ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' β-cell ', ' β-cells ', ' βCell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' Dose ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' glycemic control ', ' glucose production ', ' glucose RA ', ' glucose rate of appearance ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' diabetes control ', ' arm ', ' safety and feasibility ', ' recruit ', ' Injections ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' PK/PD ', ' in silico ', ' virtual patient ', ' autoimmune pathogenesis ', ' autoimmune attack ', ' autoimmune destruction ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,560513,OR-03
"The Impact of Drought on Arsenic Exposure and Cardiometabolic Outcomes in a Rural Aging Population Project Summary / Abstract Droughts are an important natural disaster but the health implications for elderly populations in the United States have not been extensively studied. This study seeks to provide evidence on the cardiometabolic health risks posed by drought. Droughts can contribute to groundwater over-pumping, and this may in turn lead to arsenic release from aquifer clays into drinking water sources. The impacts of drought on arsenic exposure and resultant health outcomes in human populations are potentially important and this study seeks to address that knowledge gap. We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study using data from the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study, as well as hydrogeological measurements of water and environmental conditions in the San Luis Valley, to clarify relationships between drought, arsenic in water, arsenic exposure (as measured by urine biomarker), and cardiometabolic health outcomes including incident diabetes (DM), incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality. This work is community-engaged and includes a K12 outreach component. Aim 1 quantifies the relationship of drought to individual arsenic exposures and thence to incident CVD, incident DM, and mortality. Aim 2 generates a model for groundwater arsenic as a function of hydrological predictors using machine learning approaches, and uses this to explore relationships between drought, modeled water arsenic and the outcomes of Aim 1. Aim 3 estimates the association between cumulative arsenic exposure and incident CVD, incident DM, and mortality, using a nested case-control design and predictions over time of arsenic exposure from the Aim 2 model. Aim 4 is a simulation study projecting future CVD and DM outcomes under different scenarios of drought conditions, with and without counterfactual interventions to reduce drinking water arsenic. Project Narrative This community-engaged project in San Luis Valley, Colorado seeks to identify cardiometabolic disease risks posed by drought through arsenic for elderly Hispanic and non-Hispanic white adult men and women, through interdisciplinary team science bringing together hydrogeological and epidemiological modeling.",The Impact of Drought on Arsenic Exposure and Cardiometabolic Outcomes in a Rural Aging Population,10299821,R01ES032612,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Arsenic ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Colorado ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Droughts ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Geology ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' clay ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Mediating ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' density ', ' Pump ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' water quality ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' water conservation ', ' drinking water ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' outreach ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' K12 ', ' SECTM1 ', ' Secreted and Transmembrane 1 ', ' SECTM1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' sex ', ' cost ', ' epidemiological model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Plug-in ', ' hydrology ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' Medicare claim ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' STEM career ', ' STEM workforce ', ' science, technology, engineering and math career ', ' science, technology, engineering and math workforce ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics career ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce ', ' Learning Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' exposure pathway ', ' Retrospective cohort study ', ' secondary analysis ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' biological sex ', ' extreme weather ', ' Cardiometabolic Disease ', ' Cardiometabolic Disorder ', ' weather-related disaster ', ' weather disaster ', ' geochemistry ', ' geochemical ', ' community engaged research ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,671536,CO-06
"Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction ABSTRACT: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects women during reproductive years, raising concerns regarding maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Although physicians no longer uniformly discourage women with SLE from childbearing, patients face 20% likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including preeclampsia, fetal and neonatal death, growth restriction, and preterm delivery, even during clinical disease quiescence. Because there are no established instruments to predict APO in individual patients, SLE pregnancies are intensely monitored at an emotional cost to patients and financial burden to society. The ability to identify, early in pregnancy, patients at high risk of APO would significantly enhance our capacity to clinically manage patients. Furthermore, validated risk stratification models are needed to design and execute trials to prevent APOs. In PROMISSE, the largest multi-center, multi-ethnic and multi-racial study of pregnant SLE patients to date, several risk factors were identified as significant predictors of APO. Although a major advance, these results have neither been externally validated nor shown to generalize to independent study populations. Moreover, risk factors were identified using standard statistical models that did not fully account for complex effects of multiple predictor variables. In this project, an international team of SLE, obstetric and biostatistics researchers, led by PROMISSE investigators, will rigorously develop and externally validate an APO prediction model by leveraging data from PROMISSE (N=447), as well as five independent cohorts of lupus patients from different countries (total N = 979). In Aim 1, powerful machine learning algorithms will be applied to PROMISSE data to create an accurate and clinically useful model to predict APOs in SLE patients. To maximize utility of this model in the real world, only clinical and laboratory features that are routinely and accurately assessed on SLE patients during clinical care will be considered as potential predictors. In Aim 2, the APO model will be externally validated in prospective cohorts of pregnant lupus patients from Europe (France: N=246; Germany: N=180; Norway: N=349) and regions in the US, not included in PROMISSE (South Carolina: N=82; Bronx, NY: N=122). These cohorts are heterogeneous with respect to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic strata, and SLE disease activity, allowing for a thorough investigation into generalizability and transportability of the APO model to diverse lupus patient populations. In each cohort, detailed baseline and longitudinal clinical, laboratory and pregnancy outcome data have been obtained using procedures similar to those in PROMISSE. The overarching goal is development of an online risk calculator that will significantly improve real world clinical decision making and enable risk stratification for future APO prevention trials. Impact: An accurate, validated, and user-friendly prediction model for APO is necessary for effective clinical care of pregnant lupus patients, optimal allocation of healthcare resources, and the design of and recruitment to future clinical trials of experimental interventions to prevent APO. Project Narrative Pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for poor outcomes, such as very premature delivery, fetal death or growth restriction, yet there are no validated instruments to predict pregnancy outcomes in individual patients and focus care on those most likely to have serious complications. Our proposal is to develop and validate a prediction model that can be used to identify, early in pregnancy, SLE patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. This tool will significantly enhance the capacity to manage these patients, optimize allocation of healthcare resources, and design and conduct trials of new treatments to prevent the placental insufficiency that can result in poor outcomes.",Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction,10248288,R21AR076612,"['Affect ', ' Angiogenic Factor ', ' Angiogenesis Factor ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Activation ', ' complement pathway regulation ', ' Conceptions ', ' Financial cost ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Europe ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fetal Death ', ' fetus death ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Fetus ', ' France ', ' Future ', ' Germany ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Laboratories ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity -

"Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer This is an application for renewal of Clinical Center designation of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center has provided considerable leadership in the organization and progress of the CPDPC. Dr. Pandol serves as co-chair of the Steering Committee and Dr. Goodarzi co-chairs the Type 3c Working Group. We have excelled in recruitment and retention of participants in the cohort studies implemented through the CPDPC designed to elucidate the natural history and develop means of diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its complications in children and adults, and to determine the pathogenic interrelationships of diabetes and pancreatic cancer and develop the means of early diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have been performing a number ancillary and associated studies to support the overall goals of CPDPC, including: 1. Epidemiologic studies defining risk factors for pancreatic cancer and the natural history of CP; 2. Determining that genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for diabetes associated with CP; 3. Developing liquid biopsy assays for aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and CP; 4. Investigating mechanisms of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer for rational pharmaceutical treatments; and 5. Conducting pilot clinical trials for treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. For the next phase of the CPDPC we are committed to the following Specific Aims: 1. Continue recruitment and retention of subjects in CPDPC cohort studies (PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, NOD,  DETECT) in existing and additional study sites, as well as increase diversity in the study population. 2. Continue currently supported ancillary studies to further develop risk factor models combined with liquid  biopsy assays for early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and advance mechanism-  based treatments and clinical trials for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. 3. Build models that combine clinical features with genetic susceptibility to allow the prediction of future  development of diabetes in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 4. Determine the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with  chronic pancreatitis and diabetes, with or without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 5. Use existing and annotated pre-diagnostic CT scans to develop artificial intelligence-based techniques for  highly sensitive and specific methods for CT-based early pancreatic cancer detection. Our Center involves Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Public Health System with an organizational structure designed to expand recruitment into cohort studies of CPDPC with increased diversity and to facilitate our participation in ancillary studies. This is an application to renew the “Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer,” which consists of an expert team well-qualified to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. We plan to adjust and expand our recruitment strategies for cohort studies of the Consortium to help meet national goals; we will also continue progress on a series of ancillary studies within the Consortium designed to detect and treat pancreatic diseases. In addition, we propose new studies to develop prediction models for diabetes in chronic pancreatitis, interrogate the role of digestive enzyme insufficiency in this form of diabetes, and develop novel imaging-based methods for early pancreatic cancer detection that will, in turn, decrease the morbidity of pancreatic cancer.","Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer",10252045,U01DK108314,"['acute pancreatitis ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly

Proposed protocols address the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) and recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) who are at high risk for future development of diabetes. AP is the most common cause of pancreatogenic diabetes. While meta-analyses have revealed an incidence rate of 23% for diabetes arising after AP, they have not shed light on the type of diabetes that develops, which may comprise autoimmune or idiopathic type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), or a unique diabetes pathobiology. A detailed understanding of diabetes developing after AP will yield great benefit by facilitating novel approaches to predict, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes. The following aims are proposed to address these goals:  Specific Aim 1. Recruit a cohort of non-diabetic patients with a recent episode of AP or RAP and prospectively characterize their islet autoimmunity and glucose/insulin homeostasis using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and mixed meal tolerance tests performed 1 month after hospital discharge, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and yearly thereafter. The goals of this aim are to (a) determine the incidence of diabetes after AP, (b) identify the types of diabetes that develop after AP, (c) identify early metabolic trajectories associated with post-AP diabetes, (d) assemble the cohort that will be the platform for Aims 2-4.  Specific Aim 2. Evaluate genetic and protein risk factors for diabetes in patients with AP or RAP. This Aim will evaluate association of genetic risk scores for T1DM and T2DM with post AP diabetes. Thirteen candidate proteins, associated with post AP diabetes in preliminary studies, will be assessed for association with incident diabetes after AP, yielding a key set of proteins with utility not only in diabetes prediction but also targets for future preventive or therapeutic measures.  Specific Aim 3. Characterize the imaging phenotype that predicts development of diabetes after AP or RAP. Retrospective CT scans obtained during hospitalization for AP as well as CT and novel multiparametric MRI scans obtained 1 and 12 months afterward will undergo artificial intelligence analysis to identify the imaging biomarkers that signal diabetes risk.  Specific Aim 4. Develop a multi-factorial model to predict development of diabetes after AP or RAP. A wealth of data will be collected from Aims 1-3, which will be combined with clinical factors to build and validate (in independent datasets) an integrative predictive model of post AP diabetes. The goal is to create a model that can be used in clinical settings to identify those at highest risk, facilitating targeted measures to prevent diabetes.  This innovative research will be conducted by an experienced team of investigators in endocrinology, gastroenterology, imaging, physiology, and epidemiology to solve a problem of great public health significance. This is an application for the establishment of a Southern California Clinical Center to participate in the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium, comprised of an expert team to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. Acute pancreatitis, one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization in the USA, greatly increases the risk of future development of diabetes, yet the type of diabetes is unclear. We propose studies to determine the metabolic mechanisms and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of diabetes occurring after pancreatitis, which will provide the means to understand, prevent, and treat this form of diabetes.",Southern California Clinical Center of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium,10264920,U01DK127403,"['acute pancreatitis ', ' Artificial Intelligence ',

"DFU Clinical Research Unit Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 25% of patients and leading to ~80,000 Americans having non-traumatic amputations each year, with five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Recent evidence suggests that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are on the rise, after decades of decline, in spite of advances in targeted wound care products, establishment of interdisciplinary clinical and surgical teams, and improving diabetes medical care. Given the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the burden associated with DFU are high, including high costs of $9 billion-$13 billion per year and besides those associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the establishment of a Diabetic Foot Consortium comprised of experienced DFU Clinical Research Units (CRU) for reliable DFU biomarker discovery cannot be understated. The main objective of this proposal is to integrate the robust infrastructure at Michigan Medicine with our highly skilled clinical and translational team to establish a DFU CRU as a strong contender and contributor within the DFC network that will be uniquely poised to participate in all DFU biomarker discovery and related wound healing projects undertaken by the Consortium. Additional aims are to The aims are to : identify, recruit, and phenotype a broad spectrum of DFU participants from the large base of patients with these conditions who are currently being followed at Michigan Medicine, according to the Consortium requirements; implement standardized mechanisms and protocols for effective longitudinal sample collection and retention; and actively participate in the DFC intellectually and provide all available resources to develop and support clinical study protocols to validate DFU biomarkers, including complex quantifications of wound image features; single cell, genetic, molecular, metabolomics, and microbiome analyses; and assessing additive predictors of DFU healing beyond clinical markers alone using multi-modal approaches. The expected outcome of this work is that the Michigan Medicine DFU Clinical Center will be an integral part of the Consortia collaborative network, with a highly positive impact for the entire spectrum of biomarker discovery and future novel therapies projects. Narrative This project has major public health relevance because diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes and are the leading cause of lower extremity amputation in the US. Current treatments are ineffective and given the recent surge in major lower extremity amputations in diabetic patients despite the previous decades of decline, identification of novel treatment avenues is of critical importance. The main objective of the Diabetic Foot Clinical Center at the University of Michigan is to use our robust infrastructure and highly skilled clinical and translational research team to generate a unique platform for investigating individual contributions to DFU wound healing from clinical samples, single cell genetic and molecular analyses from DFU samples, and image analyses.",DFU Clinical Research Unit,10377784,U01DK119083,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Ulcer ', ' Ulceration ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Gender ', ' Walking ', ' Foot Ulcer ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Diabetic Foot ', ' Charcot foot ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' diabetic foot wound ', ' Diabetic Foot Ulcer ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' diabetic patient ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' recruit ', ' practice setting ', ' microbiome analysis ', ' analyze microbiome ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wound care ', ' wound assessment ', ' wound monitoring ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,49505,MI-12
"Evaluating the effect of water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this K99/R00 proposal is to estimate the effect of community water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes in California and identify whether there are subpopulations who are especially vulnerable to fluoride exposure during pregnancy. Fluoride has been added to water supplies to promote dental health in the United States since 1945, but the impacts on pregnancy outcomes have never been assessed. It is possible that maternal and in-utero fetal exposure to fluoride increases risk of preterm birth and small-for- gestational age. A small number of studies in other countries suggest there is an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes associated with drinking water with naturally high levels of fluoride, and evidence suggests fluoride consumption can affect thyroid function and cardiovascular systems, both of which play important roles in regulating and maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Since 1995, California has required water systems with at least 10,000 service connections to fluoridate their water, but systems were only required to implement a fluoridation program once the funds were allocated. Therefore, there is a substantial amount of variability in which water systems have added fluoride over the last 25 years, and when they did so. We will leverage this variation in water fluoridation practices in California to (1) identify the effects of changes in water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes during 2006-2017 and (2) evaluate whether there are heterogeneous exposure effects by maternal/fetal characteristics and environmental co-exposures. Furthermore, we will use the ECHO.CA.IL pregnancy cohort, which is composed of pregnant women and their children in San Francisco and Illinois, to (3a) assess whether maternal urinary fluoride during the second trimester is associated with reduced gestational age or lower birthweight-for-gestational-age-z-scores at birth and (3b) evaluate whether there are heterogeneous effects of exposure by maternal/fetal characteristics and environmental co-exposures. The research plan is bolstered by an exceptional mentorship team and training plan at the University of San Francisco, California. The proposed project builds on the applicant’s background in perinatal epidemiology and provides training in new statistical methods to identify heterogeneous exposure effects and education in the biological processes of gestation and parturition, exposure assessment of environmental chemicals, and translating scientific findings to policymakers. The combined research and training plans will enable the candidate to transition into an independent researcher of policy-relevant social and environmental factors that shape perinatal health. This research aligns with NIEHS’s strategic goals to evaluate health effects of the exposome, identify individual susceptibilities to environmental hazards, utilize data science techniques, and generate evidence that can be utilized by policymakers to improve population health. Project Narrative Community water fluoridation may affect perinatal health outcomes, but this has never been evaluated in the United States. It is critical to understand how this widespread practice affects the health of mothers and infants, and whether subgroups of the population are uniquely vulnerable. This project will provide critical information to assist public health officials in making informed decisions about the ongoing practice of adding fluoride to water supplies in the United States.",Evaluating the effect of water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes,10284698,K99ES033274,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Award ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition

"Gamified Optimized Diabetes-management with AI powered Rural Telehealth (GODART) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Evidence-based guidelines for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management aimed at glycemic control (reduced hemoglobin A1c) include a combination of diet, physical activity (PA), glucose monitoring, and medication adherences. However, the majority of individuals with T2DM are unable to follow these guidelines due to a lack of consistent health behavior counseling offered in the primary care setting. This problem is amplified in remote rural communities within the U.S. In response, this project aims to create an optimized telehealth-based intervention – Gamified Optimized Diabetes management with Artificial Intelligence–powered Rural Telehealth (GODART). GODART is grounded in the social cognitive theory and will serve as an automated behavior-monitoring and telecoaching platform. At the core, GODART is an automated conversational style behavior-monitoring system using natural language–understanding technologies. In this project, we propose to pilot and feasibility test the various components of GODART by leveraging multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). MOST is an efficient and rigorous resource-management and continuous- improvement framework for developing optimized interventions. Our proposal focuses on the MOST preparatory phase and will use a full factorial experimentation. We will pilot and assess the feasibility of and evaluate two different intervention components, with two levels in each of the groups, yielding four experimental conditions. These groups will test the effect of (i) a fixed vs. adaptive (gamified) rewards program and (ii) automated vs. human-delivered weekly health coaching. We will end the project with exit interviews conducted with a subset of participants. Study findings will help us learn the feasibility of delivering such an intervention and its preliminary effectiveness in reducing HbA1c, leading to adequately powered confirmatory effectiveness studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this study is to pilot and assess feasibility of implementing an artificial intelligence assisted individualized lifestyle modification intervention for glycemic control in rural populations, which can delivered even regular a landline phone service. This study will provide us knowledge to plan a well powered optimization trial in future to develop an optimal (low cost) intervention package that can be delivered in a sustainable manner to the rural portions of America.",Gamified Optimized Diabetes-management with AI powered Rural Telehealth (GODART),10276845,R01DK129378,"['Americas ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Censuses ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Motivation ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Recommendation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Rural Population ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Rural Community ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' math ability ', ' math achievement ', ' math competence ', ' math competency ', ' math proficiency ', ' mathematic ability ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' number sense ', ' numeracy ', ' proficient in math ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' mathematical ability ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Deep South ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' arm ', ' rural counties ', ' recruit ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' multiphase optimization strategy ', ' Urban Community ', ' effectiveness study ', ' feasibility testing ', ' telephone coaching ', ' coaching calls ', ' telephone counseling ', ' marginalized population ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,297000,AL-07
"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity

"10/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently. We will perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long- term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, common chronic conditions of aging, and explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements.",10/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center,10157261,U01DK048380,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Metformin ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Consult ', ' preference ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' human disease ', ' intervention effect ', ' economic implication ', ' phase 3 study ', ' Phase III study ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' cognitive disability ', ' treatment group ', ' data access ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' clinical development ', ' participant retention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2021,103567,IL-07
"Image Analysis and Machine Learning Methods for Biomarkers of Age-related and Metabolic Diseases Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Makrogiannis, Sokratis, Ph.D. Abstract Age-related and metabolic diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic that affects the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million do not know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function.  Modern medical imaging technologies offer the opportunity to study the composition and morphometry of human body in ways that were previously impossible. Contemporary imaging studies that are performed in vivo on a large number of participants have enabled cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of age-related and metabolic diseases, and effects of pharmacological interventions. The emergence of advanced imaging technologies has also created the need for automated image analysis techniques for identification and quantification of morphological patterns of anatomies and tissues and their changes with increasing age.  This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies. Our research interests will concentrate on identification of morphological patterns in the mid-thigh, abdomen and lower leg that will eventually lead to development of imaging biomarkers. The accumulation of adipose tissue in the human body and changes of its regional distribution are associated with type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and the metabolic syndrome. Age-related changes in skeletal muscle composition are strongly linked to loss in muscle strength and mass, frequently termed as sarcopenia, leading to decreased mobility and function. Also, trabecular bone structural changes are associated with osteoporosis. We will use imaging and clinical data collected by the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) that is the longest ongoing epidemiology study in the US.  This work will address a technical and a clinical hypothesis. The technical hypothesis is that quantitative image analysis can accurately and robustly segment, register and fuse body composition data acquired by modern MRI and CT imaging scanners. The clinical hypothesis is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging can be used as biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome manifestations. We will build on recent advances in medical image analysis to contribute novel and non-invasive techniques for studying the human body composition and its longitudinal changes with main applications in tissue identification and quantification at the mid-thigh, lower leg and the abdomen (aim 1). Then we will develop statistical machine learning methods to achieve timely diagnosis and prognosis of metabolic and age-related conditions including the metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis, and to track the effect of interventions (aim 2).

"The Ohio State University Chronic Pancreatitis Diabetes Pancreas Cancer (CPDPC) Clinical Center ABSTRACT The mechanistic underpinnings of diseases involving the exocrine pancreas are poorly understood. Chronic pancreatitis is often accompanied by inflammation of the pancreas, irreversible fibrosis, and destruction of the pancreatic parenchyma resulting in abdominal pain, malnutrition, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatogenic diabetes, and, in some cases, pancreas cancer. We have developed a network of adult and pediatric investigators to form The Ohio State University Clinical Center (OSU CC). In a multidisciplinary collaboration with other clinical centers in the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer Clinical Centers (CPDPC-CCs) (U01), the OSU CC has helped develop four (4) major observational studies during the initial funding cycle to address research gaps in our understanding of diseases of the exocrine pancreas.

"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10246990,R01CA227122,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Uterus ', ' womb ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Leisures ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Ovarian ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Light Exercise ', ' Light Activity ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' cancer type ', ' older women ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' vigorous intensity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,640965,NC-04
"Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss SUMMARY: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in approximately 5% of clinically recognized pregnancy losses. The etiology of RPL is not well characterized: after excluding the known etiologies, approximately half of women with RPL still have no identifiable cause. The fact that RPL is, in fact, recurrent suggests a strong genetic component, however there is currently a very limited understanding of the genomic contributions to RPL. Previous studies are typically deficient in their design, limited by small sample size, incomplete clinical phenotyping and/or the recruitment of singletons only. In this proposal, we put forward our plan to recruit 1000 rigorously-phenotyped RPL trios including from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds across the US and to apply WGS and sophisticated variant detection and interpretation methods developed by our labs to identify pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for RPL. We will then perform comprehensive integrative data analyses to define the genetic basis of unexplained RPL and map the genes and regions of the chromosome that are absolutely required for human development and a successful pregnancy. Our variant interpretation pipeline includes cutting edge approaches to map likely pathogenic noncoding and structural variants rarely assessed in any pregnancy loss study. We will also perform a pilot RNA-seq study to assess the utility of this approach for gene discovery in the pregnancy loss setting. We will first look for recessive pathogenic variation, including compound heterozygosity and then test for models for de novo mosaicism, mitochondrial mutations, regulatory noncoding variation and overall mutational burden. From these combined analyses, we expect to uncover many variants in genes and regions of the chromosome that are intolerable to functional variation, which we define as the human intolerome. We will build on our previous studies to map the intolerome by combining i) available data from all clinical studies to define the genetic etiology of unexplained pregnancy loss, including data generated in this proposal and in our prior work, ii) network-based approaches to prioritize variants genes important for human development and pregnancy, iii) mouse (KOMP, DMDD/MGI) and cell line knockout studies iv) rare and common disease sequencing studies including Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG), Center for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) and Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), iv) emerging human pangenome studies HPP, and v) population-scale biobank projects such as UK BioBank and All of Us. We will then confirm these predictions via collaborator-led functional studies and retrospective analyses of RPL first losses, siblings and grandparents. The sharing of early, unpublished data from the Yale CMG and HPP enabled by our leadership in these projects is a significant strength of what will be by far the largest and most comprehensive study of RPL performed to date. Our findings will take great strides towards the goal of comprehensively mapping the human intolerome and will further expand and refine the exploratory space in which to investigate the genes and chromosomal regions essential for human development.

"21/22 Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) Phase 3 - One Year Extension - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications.

"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,10137311,R21NR019160,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age Distribution ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Americas ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Medication Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Fostering ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Coin ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Anti-diabetic Agents ', ' Antidiabetic Agents ', ' anti-diabetic ', ' anti-diabetic drugs ', ' antidiabetic ', ' Antidiabetic Drugs ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Long-Term Care Nursing ', ' Nursing Home Nursing ', ' longterm care nursing ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' diabetic patient ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' adverse event risk ', ' advanced analytics ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' ']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2021,209375,MA-02

The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,10147069,R01DK122583,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Grant ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Physical activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Tactile ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' glucose sensor ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Dose ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' arm ', ' two-arm study ', ' 2-arm study ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' fitbit ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,561582,OR-03
"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data.

"17/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently. We will perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long- term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, common chronic conditions of aging, and explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements.",17/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center,10152008,U01DK048400,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Metformin ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Consult ', ' preference ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' human disease ', ' intervention effect ', ' economic implication ', ' phase 3 study ', ' Phase III study ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' cognitive disability ', ' treatment group ', ' data access ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' clinical development ', ' participant retention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,1,MO-01
"Using predictive analytics to tailor care for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Over 1.5 million US adults are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) each year. These newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing debilitating complications, including renal disease, strokes, and myocardial infarctions. However, individuals differ widely in their likelihood of experiencing these adverse outcomes. Individual risk varies based on a complex interplay between pathophysiology, responsiveness to treatment, and patient capacity for self-management and making sustained lifestyle changes. Early T2D glycemic control provides a lasting benefit (""metabolic memory""); therefore, strategies that enable the effective targeting and tailoring of T2D care starting in the initial period after diagnosis may result in better long-term health outcomes. Implementing individually-tailored care strategies requires substantially more effective risk prediction tools than are currently available. This R21 proposal seeks to apply advanced analytic prediction modeling methods to a rich source of electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data (assessed at the time of initial diagnosis and after a year of standard management) to define individual patient risk profiles. These patient risk profiles will incorporate differences in disease physiology (e.g., reflected in factors such as age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c at diagnosis), treatment responsiveness, and early self- management results (e.g., medication adherence, weekly exercise levels, weight loss). This R21 leverages an established, well-characterized cohort of adults with incident, newly-diagnosed T2D (n=67,575) within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We will apply advanced machine learning-based modeling methods (e.g., random forests, LASSO, extreme gradient boosting) to complete the following Aims: 1) Develop and validate a predictive model using EHR-derived patient data available at T2D diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of suboptimal glycemic control over the five years following diagnosis and 2) Modify the Aim 1 model by incorporating clinical predictors captured during the first year following T2D diagnosis. We hypothesize that the unique information available at these two time points (i.e., initial diagnosis and after one year of standard treatment) can be used to individualize both initial and subsequent early care for patients with newly diagnosed T2D. If successful, this project's results can be applied to support targeted T2D care strategies tailored to each individual's risk of suboptimal five-year glycemic control (and later micro and macrovascular complications) based on differences in disease physiology, treatment response, and early self-care. This work will form the foundation for innovative, pragmatic clinical trials that advance our ultimate goal of providing proactive and effectively tailored early care that results in better long-term health outcomes for adults with T2D. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current initial type 2 diabetes care strategies are typically ""one-size-fits-all"" and do not address individual patient differences in risk of complications (like stroke, kidney disease), responsiveness to treatment, or ability to self-manage and successfully adopt lifestyle changes. We propose to apply advanced predictive modeling methods (including machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence) to data from the electronic health record to predict which newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes-related complications. The findings are intended to help clinicians individualize type 2 diabetes care from the beginning by creating optimal care plans that reduce complications and maintain long-term health.",Using

"SOCRATES: SOCial Risk and diAbetes ouTcomEs Study ABSTRACT  Health-related social needs, particularly food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation barriers, are associated with poor outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In particular, these factors are associated with worse glycemic, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol control, which significantly increases the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. They are also key drivers of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status-based disparities in diabetes outcomes. Thus, there is a growing call for interventions to address these needs and improve T2DM outcomes. However little research has assessed whether changes in health-related social needs are associated with changes in T2DM outcomes.  This knowledge gap hampers efforts to develop effective interventions. Addressing it will provide much- needed evidence on which patients to screen for which social needs, and on which interventions targeting social needs are most likely to improve T2DM outcomes. The pathways linking social needs and T2DM outcomes are likely characterized by interactions between individual- (e.g., needs, age, gender, race/ethnicity), clinic- (e.g., clinic characteristics; specifics of the intervention), and area-level factors (e.g., local economic conditions; community resources). Given this complexity, a multi-pronged approach is needed. We will combine 3 methods of investigation: 1) longitudinal, multi-level, regression analysis; 2) innovative machine learning methods to detect novel combinations of factors associated with heterogeneous response to health- related social needs and health-related social needs interventions while avoiding spurious findings; and 3) thoughtful qualitative investigation. Such an analysis has never before been possible, because the needed data elements have not been united.  This proposal seeks to answer whether improvements in specific health-related social needs are associated with improvements in specific clinical outcomes, in what circumstances, and which approaches to addressing health-related social needs, if any, best improve outcomes. We will leverage what we believe to be the nation’s largest dataset of patient-reported health-related social needs, clinical outcomes, and community- and clinic-level data. We will examine whether changes in health-related social needs are associated with changes in hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol. Further, we will evaluate whether clinic-based interventions seem to improve these outcomes, and if there are important variations in these interventions that are associated with different response to the intervention. The proposed work will yield important, previously unavailable evidence on how to refine and improve health-related social need interventions. Specifically, it will help us understand better how better to care for a population at high risk for T2DM complications. Overall, this project will substantially advance NIDDK’s mission to improve health equity for vulnerable individuals with T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health-related social needs, particularly food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation barriers, affect over 6 million people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with poor clinical.

"Diabetic Retinopathy: Genetics and Neurodegeneration (MSN246458) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of vision loss among working aged adults. Its prevalence is increasing and despite the strides in knowledge and treatments, our understanding of the pathways leading to vision loss in DM remains limited. Hyperglycemia and duration of DM contribute to but do not fully explain the predisposition to develop diabetic retinal diseases. Given the predisposition for diabetic retinal diseases to cluster in families, genetic risk factors are thought to be important but none has so far been definitively implicated. Furthermore, data from small studies suggest that there are more phenotypes of diabetic retinal disease than are currently recognized in clinical practice. Diabetic retinal disease has traditionally been considered primarily a vascular process: diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the main clinical manifestations. With improved imaging modalities and image analysis algorithms, there has been increasing recognition of a new clinical manifestation of diabetic retinal disease, diabetic retinal neurodegeneration (DRN). This is visible as alterations in thickness of retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and/or ganglion cell layer (GCL) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. To date, DRN is poorly understood, and its role in clinical management of patients with DM has not been established. However, if retinal neurodegeneration occurs and is progressive, it can lead to profound visual difficulties for patients with DM. DRN may account for previously unexplained poor visual outcomes among patients with diabetic retinal disease despite standard of care treatment. Dr. Channa is a retina specialist, with prior research experience in retinal imaging and clinical trials of novel treatments for DME. In this K23 career development award she proposes to use a nationally representative dataset, the UK Biobank cohort to: 1) improve our understanding of DRN by determining RNFL and GCL thickness, using OCT imaging, in participants with DM (who have no DR or DME) compared to those who do not have DM 2) determine genetic factors associated with DR, DME and DRN. Dr. Channa proposes a career development plan, which includes mentorship, coursework, publications and clinical time.

"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding.

"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

"DFU Clinical Research Unit Abstract Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 25% of patients and leading to ~80,000 Americans having non-traumatic amputations each year, with five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Recent evidence suggests that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are on the rise, after decades of decline, in spite of advances in targeted wound care products, establishment of interdisciplinary clinical and surgical teams, and improving diabetes medical care. Given the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the burden associated with DFU are high, including high costs of $9 billion-$13 billion per year and besides those associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the establishment of a Diabetic Foot Consortium comprised of experienced DFU Clinical Research Units (CRU) for reliable DFU biomarker discovery cannot be understated. The main objective of this proposal is to integrate the robust infrastructure at Michigan Medicine with our highly skilled clinical and translational team to establish a DFU CRU as a strong contender and contributor within the DFC network that will be uniquely poised to participate in all DFU biomarker discovery and related wound healing projects undertaken by the Consortium. Additional aims are to The aims are to : identify, recruit, and phenotype a broad spectrum of DFU participants from the large base of patients with these conditions who are currently being followed at Michigan Medicine, according to the Consortium requirements; implement standardized mechanisms and protocols for effective longitudinal sample collection and retention; and actively participate in the DFC intellectually and provide all available resources to develop and support clinical study protocols to validate DFU biomarkers, including complex quantifications of wound image features; single cell, genetic, molecular, metabolomics, and microbiome analyses; and assessing additive predictors of DFU healing beyond clinical markers alone using multi-modal approaches. The expected outcome of this work is that the Michigan Medicine DFU Clinical Center will be an integral part of the Consortia collaborative network, with a highly positive impact for the entire spectrum of biomarker discovery and future novel therapies projects. Narrative This project has major public health relevance because diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) remain one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes and are the leading cause of lower extremity amputation in the US. Current treatments are ineffective and given the recent surge in major lower extremity amputations in diabetic patients despite the previous decades of decline, identification of novel treatment avenues is of critical importance. The main objective of the Diabetic Foot Clinical Center at the University of Michigan is to use our robust infrastructure and highly skilled clinical and translational research team to generate a unique platform for investigating individual contributions to DFU wound healing from clinical samples, single cell genetic and molecular analyses from DFU samples, and image analyses.",DFU Clinical Research Unit,10202575,U01DK119083,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Ulcer ', ' Ulceration ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Gender ', ' Walking ', ' Foot Ulcer ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Diabetic Foot ', ' Charcot foot ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' diabetic foot wound ', ' Diabetic Foot Ulcer ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' diabetic patient ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' ineffective therapies ', ' ineffective treatment ', ' recruit ', ' practice setting ', ' microbiome analysis ', ' analyze microbiome ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wound care ', ' wound assessment ', ' wound monitoring ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,542357,MI-12
"15/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort.

"16/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) – Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol.

"Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Hypoglycemia (glucose < 70 mg/dL) remains the limiting factor for achieving optimal glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D), with nocturnal hypoglycemia being particularly dangerous. Nocturnal hypoglycemia may result in physical injury, poor sleep quality, fear of hypoglycemia, and hypoglycemia unawareness. Severe episodes can cause seizures and unconsciousness requiring emergency care, and even death (dead in bed syndrome). While automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have shown benefits in glucose control during the night, nighttime hypoglycemia still occurs. Moreover, many people with T1D manage their glucose with continuous subcutaneous infusion pump (CSII) therapy or multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) therapy. Data updated between 2013 and 2014 from 16,061 individuals with T1D participating in the T1D Exchange clinic registry showed that approximately 40% participants managed their glucose with MDI. In this project, we propose to develop and evaluate a personalized decision support tool that collects and analyzes glucose measurements, insulin, meals, and physical activity data to predict at bedtime the likelihood of overnight hypoglycemia and recommend a proactive carbohydrate intervention to substantially reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia. In the engineering development phase of the project, we will use unique datasets of time-matched glucose management data (i.e., continuous glucose measurements, insulin, meals, and exercise) from pump, closed- loop and MDI users to extract information about the major contributors to nocturnal hypoglycemia risk and train a population-based prediction model that will be personalized over time to better capture inter-subject variability. We will design a bedtime intervention consisting of a bedtime smart snack with variable nutrient content that can prevent nighttime hypoglycemia. Snacks will vary by macronutrient content and size to optimize time to peak post-prandial glycemia that will match the timing to predicted episode of hypoglycemia. We will conduct a randomized cross-over study to evaluate our smartphone-based decision support tool on a cohort of 20 people with T1D who are MDI users and are at higher risk of experiencing hypoglycemia. Participants will be randomly assigned to either first use CGM only (control period) followed by a smartphone- based decision support tool + nocturnal hypoglycemia intervention (intervention period), or vice-versa. The control and intervention periods will have a duration of three weeks each. We will measure the effect of the intervention by comparing the percent time in nocturnal hypoglycemia during the control period vs. the intervention period. We will also retrospectively measure the accuracy of the prediction model in predicting nocturnal hypoglycemia using data from the control period. We expect that the proposed bedtime intervention will lead to a significant reduction in time spent in hypoglycemia overnight of at least 50% reduction relative to baseline. Project Narrative Nocturnal hypoglycemia is one of the most challenging side effects of insulin-intensive diabetes therapy and accounts for more than 50% of level 2 hypoglycemia events (glucose < 54 mg/dL). Despite new glucose sensing technologies and automated insulin delivery systems, nocturnal hypoglycemia is a common problem for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with potentially fatal consequences as symptoms and sensor alarms may not be detected while sleeping. We propose to design a personalized decision support tool to accurately predict and prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia in people with T1D who are using either multiple daily insulin injections, pumps, or closed-loop control; and we will evaluate the developed machine learning based prediction models and a smart snack bedtime intervention within a clinical study involving people on multiple daily insulin injections therapy.",Development and Evaluation of Personalized Explainable Machine Learning Models to Predict and Prevent Nocturnal Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes,10373516,R21DK128582,"['compare intervention ', ' poor sleep ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Beds ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Exercise ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Infusion Pumps ', ' Infusors ', ' Perfusion Pumps ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' injection therapy ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Learning ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Sleep ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Cross-Over Studies ', ' Crossover Studies ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Nutrient ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes therapy ', ' diabetes mellitus therapy ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Macronutrients Nutrition ', ' Macronutrients ', ' Update ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' hypoglycemia unawareness ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Consumption ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' support tools ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' Injections ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' side effect ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,162600,OR-03
"Development of a personalized infusion failure detection algorithm combining tissue counter pressure and blood glucose data for closed-loop diabetes management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advances in diabetes care technology over the past several decades, including improvements in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), have led to more streamlined treatments and reduced burden for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). As the field moves toward increasingly autonomous, closed-loop systems for management of T1D, infusion set failure (ISF) remains a health risk to patients and a barrier to the development of artificial pancreas systems. ISF, the disruption of fluid flow from insulin pump to patient causing loss of glycemic control, affects an estimated 50% of pump wearers, placing them at risk for hyperglycemia and life-threatening complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Because modern insulin pumps are not equipped with a mechanism for monitoring infusion performance, patients may not know an ISF has occurred until experiencing symptoms of hyperglycemia. There is no existing technology capable of accurately identifying ISF in real-time, before dysregulation of blood glucose (BG). Diatech Diabetes is addressing this unmet need with SmartFusion, an AI-based platform to monitor infusion performance, immediately alert patients when ISF occurs, and help users infuse confidently and safely. Diatech’s novel algorithm leverages tissue counter pressure (TCP) and CGM data to offer a superior method for ISF detection. The company’s long-term vision is that by detecting ISF in real time, SmartFusion will improve patients’ glycemic control, prevent complications of hyperglycemia, and reduce excess medical costs. Diatech has already collected preliminary data to show that TCP waveforms can feasibly be leveraged to differentiate healthy and malfunctioned infusions. The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to collect increasingly complex and representative preclinical data to train and optimize the TCP-CGM algorithm and demonstrate proof-of-concept that it can accurately detect ISF. Diatech will pursue this goal through the following aims: 1) collect and characterize labeled in vivo TCP and x-ray imaging data of typical and malfunctioned infusions, 2) collect and characterize labeled in vivo TCP and BG/CGM data of failure modes consistent with ISF in immobilized diabetic swine, and 3) collect 3-day TCP and BG/CGM data from ambulatory diabetic swine with failure modes consistent with ISF. Successful completion of the project will result in a novel TCP-CGM algorithm to accurately detect ISF in closed- loop systems. The algorithm will be further optimized through collection and integration of clinical data in Phase II. SmartFusion will ultimately be integrated into insulin pumps and diabetes management platforms to provide real-time ISF detection and personalized recommendations for ISF prevention. Further, by enabling new avenues for control of closed-loop systems, SmartFusion can offer a significant leap forward for implementation of artificial pancreas technology, leading to improved health and quality of life for patients living with T1D. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than one million type 1 diabetes patients throughout the world rely on insulin pumps to deliver their vital medication, but infusion failures are common and can lead to serious and costly complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. There is no existing technology that accurately detects infusion failures and alerts patients to disruptions in treatment before they develop elevated blood glucose. To address this unmet need, Diatech Diabetes is developing SmartFusion, a first-of-its-kind, algorithm-based software platform that uses fluid pressure to monitor infusion performance, identify infusion failures, and alert patients before blood glucose is adversely affected, enabling better management of their type 1 diabetes.",Development of a personalized infusion failure detection algorithm combining tissue counter pressure and blood glucose data for closed-loop diabetes management,10296116,R43DK130036,"['Adhesions ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Diabetic Ketoacidosis ', ' Diabetic Acidosis ', ' Diabetic Ketosis ', ' diabetic ketoacidotic ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Equipment ', ' Exercise ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Infection ', ' Infusion Pumps ', ' Infusors ', ' Perfusion Pumps ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' pressure ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Miniature Swine ', ' Minipigs ', ' mini pig ', ' mini-swine ', ' miniswine ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' diabetic ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Artificial Pancreas ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' irritation ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Cannulas ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' fluid flow ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Skin ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' prototype ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDDK,"DIATECH DIABETES, INC.",R43,2021,299989,TN-09

"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,10221675,K23DK114497,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Productivity ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Development Plans ', ' Endocrinologist ', ' tool ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' economic cost ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Outcomes and Health Services Research ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' disease phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' shared decision making ', ' Regimen ', ' data registry ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' Patient risk ', ' health data ', ' support tools ', ' education research ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' clinical decision support ', ' data warehouse ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' risk prediction model ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' clinical encounter ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2021,168817,MN-01
"The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes. SUMMARY In the United States, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is particularly high among American Indian (AI) communities. Arsenic (As), a pervasive environmental contaminant disproportionately affecting AI communities, may explain this increased risk. Arsenic induces oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation leading to β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the impact of As on T2DM has been disputed due to a lack of coherent mechanism for these findings. Previous studies have focused on epigenomic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications), overlooking downstream regulatory mechanisms that can more directly shape phenotypes. We propose to investigate the RNA modification N6- methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA, which is directly involved in the cellular stress response. In experimental systems, arsenic induces a m6A response. m6A also modulates key processes underlying T2DM pathogenesis, including immune response and systemic inflammation. m6A is controlled by a group of proteins called reader, writer, and erasers (RWEs), responsible for adding, interpreting, and removing m6A marks. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is one example of an arsenic-sensitive m6A eraser with strong ties to T2DM and glucose homeostasis. Our pilot study in elderly men exposed to low-level arsenic supported these findings. We propose to test the hypothesis that altered m6A and RWEs are plausible mechanisms for As-related T2DM in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). The SHS is an ongoing longitudinal study in AI communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota with detailed clinical data for T2DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The SHS has measured speciated As exposure data covering childhood and adult exposure windows, both independently associated with T2DM in previous research. Leveraging the cohort design, exposure and phenotypic data, infrastructure, and study team, we propose to conduct epitranscriptomic analysis of mRNA m6A profiles via m6A sequencing and measure mRNA expression of 20 RWEs using whole blood from 1100 participants at the upcoming SHS follow up visit (scheduled for 2022- 23). Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the association of past and current As exposure with epitranscriptomic profiles of m6A and RWEs mRNA expression levels in blood; 2) determine the association of blood m6A epitranscriptomic profiles with metabolic markers and MetS, clinical T2DM prevalence, and T2DM control (glycated hemoglobin, albuminuria); 3) develop a predictive m6A fingerprint that quantifies the risk of T2DM due to As exposure using machine learning approaches. For aims 1 and 2 we will further use Mendelian randomization to assess causal relationships. Characterization of m6A profiles in a population of AI adults highly impacted by T2DM will reveal biological features linking a pervasive toxicant such as As to diabetes. In addition to leading to interventions to reduce As exposure in the US and globally, defining the roles of m6A and RWEs in T2DM may contribute to new targets for future diabetes therapies.

"the Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR) Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the U.S. and California leads the nation in incident cases and costs of Type 2 Diabetes. Individuals with low socioeconomic status, older adults, rural populations, and racial and ethnic minorities are at highest risk. The drivers of these disparities include a complex combination of interacting factors at the individual, family, community, health system, societal, and policy levels. Programs and policies that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes interventions into widespread practice across diverse communities, modes of delivery, and a range of settings are desperately needed. The Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR) aims to advance health equity science through the development and translation of: 1) innovations and structural changes to healthcare delivery systems that substantively reduce health inequalities, and 2) innovative, scalable interventions to alter the socioenvironmental drivers of the Type 2 Diabetes epidemic and associated disparities. Focusing on the northern California and Central Valley regions of California, the DREAMS-CDTR will conduct clinical research and interventions designed to inform practice and policy change at the health system, community and policy levels. The DREAMS-CDTR (formerly Health Delivery Systems) brings together translational science core faculty who have expertise in diverse, multi-level areas including: food insecurity, medication adherence, health communication, health IT, social policy, and cost effectiveness analysis. DREAMS-CDTR will involve four regional academic sites with a range of public and non-profit health systems that serve large and diverse populations: Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s Division of Research and the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis. The DREAMS-CDTR activities include: an Administrative Core, Pilot and Feasibility Program, Enrichment Program, and three coordinated research cores - Health Equity & Action Translational (HEAT) core, Methods and Data Integration (MDI) translational core, and National Diabetes Policy Research Resource (DPR) core. The HEAT Core will employ a multi-level systems approach to designing rigorous action-oriented observational and interventional research. The MDI Core will systematically prepare and support DREAMS-CDTR members in harnessing novel advances in methods and data to achieve greater health equity in Type 2 Diabetes. Lastly, the novel National DPR Core will extend the reach of the DREAMS-CDTR expertise and resources beyond the primary institutions in five key areas of expertise: (1) natural experiments research,(2) health economics, including comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis; (3) simulation modeling, (4) machine learning, and (5) communicating science to policy-making institutions, community partners, health departments, and human service organizations. Narrative The purpose of this renewal application is to continue and refocus the work of the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research (HDS-CDTR) (P30 DK092924), renamed the Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS- CDTR), on reducing diabetes related health disparities and improving health equity. Refocused on northern California and its Central Valley, the DREAMS-CDTR is a collaborative partnership between the Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s Division of Research and the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis. This Center leverages expertise in two Core Translational Research areas of health equity and methods and data integration and from a national diabetes policy resources core to accelerate the

"Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment after Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: the nuMoM2b-Heart Health Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are now recognized as a key pathogenic factor in dementia, and represent a promising target for intervention. Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction, are associated with future maternal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. However, the impact of APOs on maternal VCID remains unexamined. Most existing women's cardiovascular and aging cohorts lack rigorously phenotyped, prospectively collected pregnancy data, and the impact of maternal factors that may predispose to both APOs and VCID is not well understood. From 2010-2013, the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) study enrolled a diverse cohort of 10,037 healthy women at 8 US academic medical centers, who were followed from early in conception through the delivery of their first child. Several years later, the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be Heart Health Study (nuMoM2b-HHS) brought back 4,475 nuMoM2b women for a second study wave, to characterize subsequent pregnancy outcomes and accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors following pregnancy. A third study wave of in-person visits will begin in early 2022. In this ancillary study, we propose to conduct neurocognitive assessments on all nuMoM2b-HHS participants during this third study wave. We will perform brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a sub-cohort of 250 women followed at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center study site, including all who experienced APOs in the index pregnancy. The overall goal of the study is to capitalize on this unique obstetric cohort to determine the impact of APOs on long term maternal VCID, through the following specific aims: (1) Investigate the impact of APOs on maternal cognition 10-15 years after delivery by comparing global cognition scores between women who experienced APOs and women who did not; (2) Determine the impact of APOs on MRI biomarkers of maternal VCID, including white matter hyperintensity volume and additional markers of cerebral small vessel disease. We hypothesize that the association of APOs with VCID markers will be partially mediated by development of new hypertension after the index pregnancy. As an exploratory aim, we will use deep pregnancy phenotyping, including maternal characteristics, biomarkers of ischemic placental disease and APOs, to create a VCID prediction model. This will be the first US study to use prospectively collected pregnancy data to investigate the impact of APOs, a sex-specific vascular risk factor, on VCID in women. Understanding the effects of APOs on early markers of VCID could help us identify women early in life who are at higher risk of dementia, and develop preventive strategies to thwart the progression of cognitive decline in this population. In addition, the collection of neurocognitive assessments on the entire nuMoM2b-HHS cohort during this study wave is an important investment, which will provide baseline data for future studies as these women continue to age.

"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction.

"A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A role for glycemic variation in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications It is well demonstrated that high glucose levels lead to more rapid development of macrovascular and microvascular complications in people with diabetes. However, there is less consistent evidence that lowering glucose levels to near normal levels prevent or slows vascular complications, particularly in more advanced stages of type 2 diabetes. The recent VADT, ACCORD, and ADVANCE trials demonstrated that intensive efforts to lower glucose had only modest effects on the rate of vascular complications. Why glycemic control strategies that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing vascular outcomes is not clear. This has raised the possibility that (1) there are glycemic metrics beyond those that reflect average glucose control, such as HbA1c, that can explain this paradox, and (2) there exists heterogeneous treatment effects of intensive glycemic therapy for macrovascular and microvascular complications, with subgroups of patients who do less well with intensive treatment counter-balancing those that do respond. In recent reports we have demonstrated long-term glycemic variability was associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, even after adjusting for traditional markers of glycemic control. Importantly, this appeared most relevant to those receiving intensive glycemic control. These preliminary findings support careful examination of determinants and consequences of glycemic variability. In this proposal, we therefore propose to (a) evaluate and compare the importance of glycemic variation, both short-term measured by 1,5-anhydroglucitol and long-term in the development of macro and microvascular complications; (b) to study whether intensive treatment is beneficial in preventing vascular outcomes when glycemic variation is constrained; (c) genetic variants associated with glycemic variation in T2D patients will explain additional risk in progression to vascular complications beyond the genetic variants associated with mean glycemic levels. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of glucose-lowering therapy in T2D are to reduce the incidence and progression of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, several large clinical trials that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing macrovascular outcomes. Our proposal focuses on filling the gap of identifying the role of glycemic variability (short-term and long-term) in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications.",A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications,10219353,R21HL150374,"['Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' Event ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' dbGaP ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' Patient risk ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' secondary analysis ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,127224,CA-33
"Neuromodulation of maternal immune adaptations in pregnancy PROJECT SUMMARY Pregnancy relies on finely-tuned adaptations of the maternal immune system to establish and maintain immune-tolerance to the semi-allogeneic fetus, which appear to be imbalanced in women experiencing complications, such as preterm birth. Outside the pregnancy context, the central nervous system can modulate systemic immunity via the sympathetic nervous system, while its role in modulating maternal immune system adaptations during pregnancy remains unknown. Understanding the determinants of immune regulation throughout pregnancy is a prerequisite to advance the early risk assessment and treatment of pathological pregnancies. This research project proposes to target the interaction between the brain, pregnancy, and the immune system. State-of-the-art immunology (mass cytometry) and neuroscience (neuromodulation of discrete neuronal circuitry) approaches will be combined to comprehensively investigate neuroimmune regulation of human term and preterm pregnancies and mouse models of pregnancy. Specifically, we hypothesize that a hyperactive sympathetic (adrenergic) tone enhances systemic pro-inflammatory monocyte responses, thereby contributing to a compromised fetal tolerance in preterm pregnancies. The first aim of this proposal will monitor the responsiveness innate pro-inflammatory monocytes to adrenergic signals (using single-cell high-dimensional mass cytometry), and the nervous-system associated proteome (e.g., adrenergic analytes, Brice Gaudilliere lab) throughout the human third trimester. This aim is based on my current expertise in human pregnancy immunology and multi-parameter approaches, and a continuation of my prior in-depth analyses of the pre-labor plasma signature and immunome in the last 100 days of healthy pregnancy, which accurately predict the onset of labor. In aim 2, to understand brain-pregnancy communication on a mechanistic level, neuroscience approaches (fiber photometry and chemogenetics) will be used under supervision of the Luis de Lecea lab, who pioneered cutting-edge neuro-modulatory techniques. Here, I will manipulate discrete neural populations, known to either suppress or enhance peripheral immunity, throughout late gestation in mouse pregnancies with the aim to monitor their link to peripheral monocyte responsiveness. Reciprocally, fiber photometry will track pregnancy- specific alterations in activity of these neural populations. In the third and final aim 3, I will determine whether monocyte responses to sympathetic signals differ throughout preterm vs. term pregnancies by analyzing maternal blood collected in each trimester of pregnancy, using high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to train a model for preterm vs. term sample classification. In the independent R00 phase, I envision to apply techniques from immunology and neuroscience to understand pregnancy biology and pathology from a central nervous system perspective. Together, the set of proposed studies will answer fundamental questions in the nascent field of brain- peripheral immunity cross-talk, and elucidate understudied mechanism of neuroimmunomodulation in pregnancy, while significantly aiding in my career development and academic transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pregnancy relies on finely-tuned maternal immune adaptations to establish and maintain immune-tolerance to the semi- allogeneic fetus, which appear to be disrupted in women experiencing complications, such as preterm birth. Outside the context of pregnancy, the central nervous system can modulate systemic immunity via sympathetic signals but strikingly, its role in modulating the maternal immune dynamics during pregnancy remains unknown. In this proposal, we will investigate whether sympathetic (adrenergic) signals regulate innate immune responses during mouse, and human term and preterm pregnancies, with the aim to elucidate neuroimmune mechanisms of brain-pregnancy interaction – a key step to advance the early risk assessment and treatment of pathological pregnancies.",Neuromodulation of maternal immune adaptations in
