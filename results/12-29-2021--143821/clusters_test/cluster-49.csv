"Molecular modeling and machine learning for protein structures and interactions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Structural biology provides a powerful lens through which to view living systems. With advances in algorithms and computing, molecular simulations have begun to complement traditional experimental approaches as tools for discovery. At the same time, data-intensive machine learning approaches are becoming increasingly important in biology, fueled by the rapid growth in high-throughput experimentation. Research in my laboratory applies techniques from structural biology, molecular simulation, and machine learning to design new protein structures and predict protein interactions. We design new protein structures in order to better understand the principles of protein folding and to create highly stable and robust molecular scaffolds for a range of biomedical applications including multivalent display of binding or signaling domains, hosting of binding or catalytic sites, and use as building blocks to assemble higher-order complexes. We predict protein interactions in order to better understand the principles of macromolecular recognition and to gain insight into the process by which the adaptive immune system discriminates self from non-self in the context of infectious and autoimmune diseases and cancer. Our research during the project period will be directed toward two broad goals: de novo design and functionalization of tandem repeat proteins, and prediction of peptide-MHC recognition by T cell receptors (TCRs). The proposed protein design work builds on our recent progress designing circular tandem repeat proteins with a range of repeat numbers and diameters and applying these designs as multivalent display scaffolds for the presentation of binding and signalling domains. Our TCR studies leverage the tools we have recently developed to model—structurally and bioinformatically—repertoires of T cell receptors and their peptide:MHC specificity. Looking ahead, I am optimistic that by combining atomically-detailed molecular simulations and data-intensive machine learning techniques we will be able to generate designed protein constructs and predictive algorithms that have a significant positive impact on human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop new computer algorithms for designing protein structures and predicting protein interactions. The rationally designed proteins that we create will have potential uses as molecular scaffolds in a wide range of biomedical applications including diagnostics and cellular therapies. By predicting the interactions between T cell receptors and antigens, we aim to better understand how the immune system discriminates self from non-self in the context of infectious and autoimmune disease and cancer.",Molecular modeling and machine learning for protein structures and interactions,10191763,R35GM141457,"['Algorithms ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Structural Models ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Tandem Repeat Sequences ', ' Tandem Repeats ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' protein folding ', ' insight ', ' cell mediated therapies ', ' cell-based therapeutic ', ' cell-based therapy ', ' cellular therapy ', ' Cell Therapy ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' structural biology ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Catalytic Core ', ' Catalytic Region ', ' Catalytic Site ', ' Catalytic Subunit ', ' Catalytic Domain ', ' simulation ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Peptide-MHC ', ' Peptide-Major Histocompatibility Protein Complex ', ' pMHC ', ' Peptide/MHC Complex ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Molecular Machines ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Adaptive Immune System ', ' acquired immune system ', ' T-cell receptor repertoire ', ' TCR repertoire ', ' ']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2021,291907,WA-07
"Cannabinoid CB2 Receptor Structure and Allosteric Modulators Cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 (CB2) is a class-A family G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), located primarily in immune-associated tissues but also in specific regions of the brain, and implicated in several inflammatory diseases and addiction. Drugs targeting CB2 are attractive treatment alternatives for chronic neurological pain and neuroinflammatory autoimmune diseases since they avoid deleterious psychotropic effects that are associated with CB1. While drug development efforts have been primarily focused on small molecules targeting the orthosteric site, limitations of poor selectivity, lack of efficacy, and development of resistance have hampered such effort. At present, there is great interests in identifying GPCR allosteric modulators that either enhance (positive allosteric modulators, or PAMs) or inhibit (negative allosteric modulators, or NAMs) agonist-induced receptor activity. PAMs/NAMs often exhibit improved subtype selectivity and spatiotemporal sensitivity, as well as potential biased signaling properties compared to orthosteric ligands. We have recently reported a 3.2 Å cryo-EM structure of the agonist-bound human CB2-Gi complex. Based on such progress, the overall goals of this proposal are to obtain a structural understanding of CB2 allosteric modulation and use our integrated computational and experimental medicinal chemistry/biology approaches to design and synthesize novel allosteric modulators for the development of CB2-specific small-molecules with potential to treat CB2-associated maladies. Thus, we first propose to elucidate the structural basis for the action of CB2 allosteric modulators by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography approaches. To achieve the goal, we will advance our established methods for structural studies on CB2 to obtain structure of CB2 with known PAMs or NAMs. Subsequently, we plan to perform in silico design of novel CB2 allosteric modulators by our established molecular fingerprint machine-learning (ML) computing algorithms and receptor docking approaches, on basis of our reported chemogenomics cannabinoid molecular information database (CBID) and 3D CB2-Gi cryo-EM structure; a virtual allosteric modulator library will be constructed using our fragment-based design (FBD) method and our established ML-classifiers and features-ranking will be applied for selection of virtual hits. Results will be correlated with CB2 structure-based modulator design via adapting the structural information obtained from our recent CB2-Gi cryo-EM structure and our novel molecular complex characterizing system (MCCS) algorithm. Finally, we will carry out medicinal chemistry synthesis of CB2 PAM and NAM ligands and validate them by radiometric binding and cellular functional assays. With the proof-of-evidence of our recent discovery of a putative CB2 NAM, successful completion of these Aims will provide unprecedented structural information on CB2 allosteric pockets, identify promising new CB2 allosteric modulators, and help to elucidate CB2 signaling and pharmacology. Narrative The research work if completed will determine the 3D structure of allosteric binding sites for cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), a significantly important drug target for treatment of diseases and disorders in which the role of CB2 is implicated (such as pain, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases and certain cancers), and allow for novel CB2 allosteric modulators to be produced via

"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,10251944,R01GM123131,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Charge ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Influentials ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligands ', ' Literature ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Protease Gene ', ' Proteases ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteins ', ' Nicotinic Receptors ', ' Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Ricin ', ' Castor Bean Lectin ', ' RCA 60 ', ' RCA60 ', ' Ricinus Communis Agglutinin II ', ' Ricinus Lectin ', ' Ricinus Toxin ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serine Protease ', ' Serine Endopeptidases ', ' Serine Protein Hydrolases ', ' Serine Proteinases ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Toxin ', ' Tweens ', ' Universities ', ' HIV Protease ', ' HIV Proteinase ', ' HTLV-III Protease ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' English Language ', ' Electrostatics ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' preference ', ' hydropathy ', ' mutant ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' structural biology ', ' Hydrophobicity ', ' Potential Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Protein Family ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' biophysical mechanism ', ' Biophysical Process ', ' Resolution ', ' Structural Biologist ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Validation ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' ']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,257752,PA-07
"Combined computational and structural studies to create novel macromolecular recognition properties PROJECT SUMMARY The design of macromolecular binding interactions and complexes, and corresponding alteration of binding specificity, is a challenging endeavor that remains recalcitrant to computational approaches. This is true both for the creation of protein-protein complexes (which are driven by a enthalpic changes established primarily by stereochemical complementarity, balanced against large competing entropic changes) and for the redesign of protein-DNA complexes (which are heavily dependent upon DNA bending, hydrogen-bonds, electrostatic contacts, and the presence of solvent and counterions throughout the molecular interface). Over the past several years we have collaborated with several computational groups to help develop and validate computational approaches for the design and optimization of protein-protein recognition, protein-DNA recognition, and protein-small molecule recognition. Those studies have contributed to several new computational engineering approaches, including hybrid strategies that combine ab initio design of protein folds and binding sites, the ‘Rotamer Interaction Feld’ (RIF) docking protocol for efficient sampling of protein sequence and conformation, and novel parametric design approaches to create new tandem repeat proteins. We propose to continue this work through two specific aims to further develop and improve upon computational approaches for protein design. As part of this project, we will solve atomic resolution crystal structures of many selected and designed molecular complexes and provide them to our immediate collaborators as well as to a public structure prediction project, for computational prediction challenges. Aim 1. We will design and characterize novel self-associating circular tandem repeat proteins (using both de novo computational design and using high-throughput selections) and then further design them to undergo ligand-induced protein-protein association. Beyond the challenge of combining protein scaffold design and ligand binding design, the motivation for this aim is to determine the structural and mechanistic features of small molecule ligand-binding, and balance of forces, that facilitate ligand-induced protein-protein association. Aim 2. We will improve our understanding and ability to design novel protein-DNA recognition specificities and behaviors. To accomplish this, we will: (1) Systematically select and optimize a series of variants of a model DNA-binding protein, that display altered binding specificity across two regions of partially overlapping sequential clusters of basepairs and neighboring protein residues. (2) Determine the high-resolution structures and binding behavior of each construct. (3) Supervise blinded computational efforts, using multiple approaches, to predict the same structures. (4) Compare and analyze the results of computational predictions versus multiple computational prediction strategies to define features influencing predictive accuracy. For both aims, we will further exploit our crystallographic structures by computationally ‘reverse engineering’ each construct using validated protein structures, to further understand the performance of design approaches.

"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10200091,R01GM132595,"['Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Crystallization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Teaching Materials ', ' teacher materials ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Generations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' density ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Descriptor ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' electron density ', ' experience ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' computational chemistry ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Nucleic Acid Binding ', ' Effectiveness ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' stem ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Structural Protein ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,561173,VA-05
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Environment ', ' Fingers ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' slug ', ' Exposure to ', ' Reporter ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' exhaustion ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' WAGR ', ' WT1 ', ' WT1 Gene Product ', ' WT1 Protein ', ' WT33 ', ' Wilms Tumor 1 ', ' Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 ', ' WT1 gene ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' model design ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' user-friendly ', ' loss of function ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339,NY-12
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs.

"Functional Determinants in G-Protein-Coupled Receptors FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this work is to rationally manipulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) activation with the hope to develop novel therapeutic approaches in this major family of transmembrane receptors and drug targets. Our hypothesis is that evolutionary divergence patterns can reveal the roles that GPCR sequence positions play, individually or together, in order to mediate ligand binding, allosteric conformational switching, and finally ligand-biased activation of efferent signaling pathways, which can be G protein-dependent or independent. In the past funding period, computational analysis of such evolutionary patterns revealed: Intramolecular allosteric communication in the transmembrane domain of dopamine D2R receptor; Modular components of an allosteric switch controlling B2AR functional selectivity; A new non-canonical cAMP- independent signaling pathway in that same receptor; and Ligand specificity determinants in the extracellular domain of metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluR). Technical progress led to: increased accuracy to assess the impact of coding mutations in proteins through a first-principle equation for the evolutionary variations of genotype and phenotype; The generalization of our analyses of evolutionary divergence to consider co-varying residues; and new methods to unravel complex simultaneous assay readouts to stratify drug effects on GPCRs. Together these and other data support new aims that combine biological and algorithmic goals: 1. To titrate mutationally the signaling bias of bioamine receptors. 2. To uncover allosteric mediators in metabotropic glutamate receptors. 3. To identify a systematic role of GPCR mutations in cancer. The outcome should reveal new aspects of the molecular basis of signaling in an important family of pharmaceutical targets. It will also link sequence and structure genomics databases to the molecular basis of function and to the rational re- design of protein function–key steps towards manipulating cellular pathways. FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS Narrative of the project G protein-coupled receptors account for nearly half of all current medications, yet so far relatively few have been successfully targeted by drugs. One of the difficulties is that we have limited knowledge of their mechanisms at a detailed level. This proposal attempts to uncover the mechanisms of these proteins so that in the longer term we can design new drugs that block their role in diseases, including in cancer.",Functional Determinants

"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,10152659,R35GM127040,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Goals ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Protein Domains ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' mimetics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' small molecule ', ' Length ', ' Affinity ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' therapeutic target ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,556806,NY-12
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,10249195,R01GM123314,"['Algorithms ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Exons ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' K562 Cells ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Binding Motif ', ' Protein-Protein Interaction Domain ', ' Protein Binding Domain ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Computational Technique ', ' K-562 ', ' K562 ', ' K562 blasts ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' RNA Recognition Motif ', ' Putative RNA-Binding Region ', ' RNA Binding Domain ', ' RNP Domain ', ' RNP Motif ', ' RNP-1 Signature ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' deep sequencing ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' MALAT1 gene ', ' MALAT1 ', ' metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' HepG2 ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing ', ' CLIP-Seq ', ' HITS-CLIP ', ' High-throughput sequencing of CLIP cDNA library ', ' predictive tools ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' RNA metabolism ', ' ']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,302431,IN-07
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions.

"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs. We have developed a prototype technique that leverages eRNAs to infer the activity of all TF in a cell simultaneously.",A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity,10204040,R01GM125871,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Behavior ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Waardenburg syndrome ', "" Waardenburg's syndrome "", ' dyschromia iridocutanea et dysplasia auditiva ', ' van der Hoeve Halbertsona Waardenburg syndrome ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Stimulus ', ' Reporter ', ' cooking ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' ChIP assay ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' Polymerase ', ' ESR1 ', ' Estrogen Receptor 1 ', ' NR3A1 ', ' ESR1 gene ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' human disease ', ' prototype ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Drug Screening ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Familial Platelet Disorder ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,287610,CO-02
"Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory's research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms key to the regulation of membrane protein function and to the modulation of their output signaling. We use cryo-EM and advanced classification methods, such as manifold embedding, combined with modeling and molecular dynamics to study how ligands produce shifts in conformation equilibria and bias signaling output. We are currently studying two systems that allow us to study how different types of ligands influence the gating of ion channels. We are studying the role of lipids in triggering gating of mechanosensitive channels of the MscS family, a model system of membrane tension-sensing which can yield important information about the fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role that lipid-protein interactions play in this process. We have a longstanding interest in the mechanism and modulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel fundamental to heart and skeletal function. We are using manifold embedding, a machine learning-based method to analyze cryo-EM images, to better understand how small molecules and ions such as calcium and ATP affect the conformational energy landscape of the channel. We aim to shed light on the gating mechanism of this very large ion channel, a prerequisite to understanding of its modulation by protein ligands, post-translational modifications and drugs. Our approach to these fundamental problems is to use a commbination of cryo-electron microscopy, advanced image classification techniques, modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to delineate allosteric pathways mechanistically and then test proposed models with biophysical methods such as single-channel measurements, HDX-MS and mutagenesis. Our ultimate aim is to greatly increase our molecular understanding of the gating and allosteric modulation of ion channels. Progress towards such knowledge has the potential to open the way for the design of small molecule allosteric modulators with very well controlled effects on their targets, aiding the development of drugs with limited side effects. A longer-term aim is to further develp and use our tools towards gaining a better understanding of allosteric modulation in other classes of membrane proteins of therapeutic importance. In particular, G protein-coupled receptor ligands can induce the selective binding of different transducers in a process called biased signaling. The molecular mechanisms at play in this process are still poorly understood despite their fundamental importance for the development of safer drugs. Project Narrative Ion channels are involved in a large number of vital processes, such as heart and muscle function for the ryanodine receptor and function of kidneys and regulation of blood pressure for mechanosensitive channels. This work focuses on understanding the function and regulation of ion channels. Better understanding of small ligand and lipid-protein interactions in these channels can lead more generally to a better understanding of ion channels function and to the design of drugs treating the numerous diseases associated with their malfunction.",Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM,10178048,R35GM133598,"['Affect ', ' Calcium ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Heart ', ' Ion Channel Gating ', ' Ion Channel Gatings ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ions ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Play ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Transducers ', ' Work ', ' Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel ', ' Ca Release Channel-Ryanodine Receptor ', ' Calcium-Ryanodine Receptor Complex ', ' Ryanodine Receptor ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' base ', ' Muscle function ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' skeletal ', ' interest ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' native protein drug ', ' pharmaceutical protein ', ' protein drug agent ', ' therapeutic protein ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIGMS,ADVANCED SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2021,392500,NY-13
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,10167719,R01GM053148,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Aging ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Anions ', ' Behavior ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biology ', ' Carrier Proteins ', ' Transport Protein Gene ', ' Transport Proteins ', ' Transporter Protein ', ' Catalysis ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Proton Pump ', ' H(+) Pump ', ' H+ Pump ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Kinetics ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Oligopeptides ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Proteins ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Wisconsin ', ' antiporter ', ' Ion Transport ', ' protonation ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' chemical reaction ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Co-Transporters ', ' symporter ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' chemical bond ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' Phosphate Transport Proteins ', ' Phosphate Transporters ', ' Inorganic Phosphate Transporter ', ' Influenza A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Type A Influenza ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Influenza B ', ' Influenza Viruses Type B ', ' Orthomyxoviruses Type B ', ' Influenza B Virus ', ' delta pH ', ' deltapH ', ' pH gradient ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' ATP Synthesis ', ' ATP Synthesis Pathway ', ' Data ', ' Quantum Mechanics ', ' Transport Process ', ' Molecular Transport ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' anti-influenza drug ', ' anti-flu drug ', ' antiflu drug ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multi drug transporter ', ' multidrug transporter ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Grain ', ' in silico ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,310328,IL-01
"Investigation of ssDNA binding proteins and protein-ssDNA interactions Project Summary/Abstract Molecular interactions between proteins and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) play crucial roles in many fundamental biological processes, such as DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, gene regulation, and genome stability. ssDNA-binding proteins encompass various degrees of binding specificity, ranging from highly specific to non-specific. Despite the critical roles of protein-ssDNA interactions in essential biological processes, the investigation of protein-ssDNA interactions lags far behind other types of protein-nucleic acids interactions, such as protein-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) interaction. Currently there are no comprehensive, well-annotated resources for studying protein- ssDNA interactions. This proposal aims to investigate the mechanism of protein-ssDNA interactions by first constructing well-annotated protein-ssDNA data resources and by performing comparative analysis at two different levels. The first is to compare structural features between protein-ssDNA complexes with different binding specificity. The second is to investigate the similarity/differences between protein- ssDNA and protein-dsDNA complexes. In addition, we propose to predict novel ssDNA binding proteins from the unannotated protein sequences by combining structure-based protein threading methods and sequence-based machine learning approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to build comprehensive data resources for studying complexes between protein and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and to investigate the structure and function of ssDNA binding proteins.

"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Surface Antigens ', ' Cell Surface Antigens ', ' Immunologic Surface Markers ', ' Immunological Surface Markers ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Serology test ', ' serology assay ', ' Specificity ', ' Synthetic Antigens ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Immunology ', ' Custom ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tickborne illness ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serology ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' synthetic peptide ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' technological innovation ', ' Proteome ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' cross reactivity ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' Prevalence ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' patient population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' erythema migrans ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' seasonal influenza ', ' seasonal flu ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' classification algorithm ', ' tick-borne ', ' tickborne ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' tick bite ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' antigen diagnostic ', ' antigen based diagnostics ', ' Autoimmune ', ' ']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000,AZ-09
