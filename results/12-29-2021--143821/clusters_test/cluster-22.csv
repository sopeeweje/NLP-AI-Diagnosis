"The Human Foveal Connectome The complex relationship of cone photoreceptor cells with retinal circuits, Müller glia, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is essential to normal vision. Yet for the cones in the very center of the fovea that mediate peak visual acuity these relationships are poorly characterized. A longstanding barrier to a comprehensive understanding of cellular and subcellular foveal structure is the myriad interactions among a great diversity of cell types embedded and miniaturized within a complex three-dimensional architecture. The broad long-term objective of this new research program is to elucidate foveal microstructure directly by application of new methods of volume electron microscopy (connectomics). We will utilize retinal tissue acquired from an innovative organ donor program that will permit pre-recovery optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to assess retinal health status and foveal pit morphology and to guide connectomic reconstruction. Preliminary data from two donor eyes demonstrates feasibility of complete reconstructions of foveal cones and their associated synaptic pathways, Müller cells, and RPE cells. The first reconstructions of cone microcircuits from an adult born preterm indicate that the critical cells and synaptic pathways for foveal vision differ dramatically in structure and localization anticipated from previous work on non-human primates. Therefore in Aim 1 we propose to localize, identify and reconstruct quantitatively the synaptic visual pathways that arise from the central-most foveal cones. We will characterize all of the bipolar and ganglion cell circuits arising from these cones and test the new hypothesis that the dominant “midget” pathway subserving spatial acuity may be highly variable across individuals in both circuitry and pit localization. We will further test the hypothesis that beyond the midget circuit the foveal center gives rise to over twenty distinct but as yet uncharacterized visual pathways. The first reconstructions of Müller cells revealed the intimate wrapping of cone axons and abundance of processes in the plexiform layer and foveal floor. In Aim 2 we propose complete reconstructions of Müller cells to test the hypotheses that the foveal floor contains a novel Müller cell type restricted to inner retina and that morphology of individual Müller cells and their foveal distribution accounts for the macular pigment distribution. The first reconstructions of RPE cells provided new insights on the distribution of organelles important in clinical OCT and autofluorescence imaging. Therefore, in Aim 3 we propose to reconstruct and enumerate organelles in RPE cells in the cone-only fovea and the mixed rod-cone perifovea. We will directly test the hypothesis that RPE organelle content and distribution differs between cone-only fovea and rod-rich perifovea, accounting for the appearance of OCT bands and for topography of autofluorescence signal in clinical imaging. This proposal combines expertise and innovation in neurobiology, pathology, imaging, and connectomics. Outcomes will impact retinal neurobiology, clinical image interpretation, and pathophysiology of macular diseases, especially age-related macular degeneration. The human fovea is essential for best vision but understanding the crucial cellular interactions among photoreceptors, neural circuits and supporting non-neural cells in the foveal center is limited because the extremely miniaturized and complex three-dimensional structure and synaptic organization of this region is difficult to untangle with conventional methods. The proposed project will apply new methods of volume electron microscopy (“connectomics”) to reconstruct the human fovea for the first time. Outcomes will have broad significance for retinal neuroscience, clinical image interpretation, and the pathophysiology of macular disease, especially age-related macular degeneration.",The Human Foveal Connectome,10089446,R01EY028282,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aging ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Axon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Female ', ' Floor ', ' fovea centralis ', ' Fovea ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipofuscin ', ' male ', ' Melanosomes ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Miniaturization ', ' Miniaturisations ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organelles ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Pigments ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Structure of retinal pigment epithelium ', ' Outer pigmented layer of retina ', ' Pigment cell layer of retina ', ' Pigmented layer of retina ', ' Retinal Pigment Epithelium ', ' Retinal pigment epithelial cells ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' density ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Apical ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Retinal Cone ', ' Cone Photoreceptors ', ' cone cell ', ' Link ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Recovery ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Rods and Cones ', ' Vertebrate Photoreceptors ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Muller glia ', ' Müller cell ', ' Müller glia ', "" Muller's cell "", ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' disorder of macula lutea ', ' macula abnormality ', ' macula lutea abnormality ', ' macular disease ', ' macular disorder ', ' maculopathy ', ' disorder of macula of retina ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' miniaturize ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' reconstruction ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' visual performance ', ' postsynaptic ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' Cone ', ' connectome ', ' clinical imaging ', ' pathology imaging ', ' Rod ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,452171,WA-07
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation Project Summary/Abstract One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign—yet annoying—examples of ‘normal’ forgetting, it is also a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have emphasized the critical role of pattern separation in reducing memory interference. Pattern separation involves coding similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for confusion is thereby minimized. While there is general agreement that pattern separation is implemented by the hippocampus—and that pattern separation is important for reducing memory interference—there remain several fundamental gaps in our understanding of how, when, and why pattern separation occurs. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity—that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation—to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. Project Narrative A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may only represent an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia—groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate— memory confusion and interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting, including in younger and older adults, and will lead to fundamental new insight into how the brain resolves interference between similar memories.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,10123856,R01NS089729,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Memory Disorders ', ' Cognitive Retention Disorders ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Names ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' dentate gyrus ', ' Dentate Fascia ', ' Fascia Dentata ', ' Gyrus Dentatus ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Funding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' forgetting ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Property ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' motivated behavior ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' neural patterning ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,485965,OR-04
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,10159320,R01NS112326,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clathrin ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diffusion ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Exocytosis ', ' Extracellular Space ', ' Intercellular Space ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methodology ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH- and ELK-Related Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH-and ELK-Related Kinase ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 Precursor ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase EEK ', ' Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor EEK ', ' Tyrosine-Specific Protein Kinase ', ' Tyrosylprotein Kinase ', ' hydroxyaryl protein kinase ', ' tyrosyl protein kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Tetanus ', ' clostridial tetanus ', ' Time ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Cell Shape ', ' Lateral ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' NSF attachment protein receptor ', ' SNARE ', ' soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor ', ' SNAP receptor ', ' Morphology ', ' Vesicle ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' Growth Cones ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' synapse formation ', ' synaptogenesis ', ' physical model ', ' Stretching ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' PHluorin ', ' axon growth cone guidance ', ' axon guidance ', ' Regulation of Exocytosis ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' FADK ', ' FAK ', ' FAK1 ', ' PTK2 ', ' pp125FAK ', ' PTK2 gene ', ' v-SNAREs ', ' vesicule SNARE proteins ', ' vesicular SNARE proteins ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent ', ' TIRF Microscopy ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy ', ' Rupture ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,384007,NC-04
"Neural Encoding of Social Information PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50 years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Project Narrative:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing social communication is of paramount importance as deficits in expressive and receptive vocal communication skills are hallmark characteristics of a wide range of neurological disorders. The proposed experiments aim to determine the direct impact of social communication on behavior and delineate how neural circuits encode social communication. Ultimately, knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential to inform and hasten the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Neural Encoding of Social Information,10183334,R01MH122752,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Agonistic Behavior ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Pheromone ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vocalization ', ' experience ', ' adult animal ', ' mature animal ', ' free behavior ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' affiliative behavior ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' social communication ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' source localization ', ' microphone ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2021,618061,DE-00
"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning. This study will broaden our understanding of how neural circuits control normal social behaviors and will contribute to the identification of novel interventions for social deficits.",Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance,10167793,K99MH124435,"['new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' social neuroscience ', ' resilience ', ' optogenetics ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' neural correlate ', ' redshift ', ' training opportunity ', ' recruit ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social interventions ', ' Affect ', ' Agonistic Behavior ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Dominance ', ' Dominance Hierarchy ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Bilateral ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' social competition ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' cell cortex ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' novel strategies ', ' ']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2021,123390,CA-49
"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction.

"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10237353,K01AG068598,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's

"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's  disease, schizophrenia, depression, and temporal lobe epilepsy. For more than a century, neuroscientists have  marveled  at  the  extensive  diversity  of  neuronal  cell  types  that  comprise  the  hippocampus  and  other  brain  structures,  yet  we  still  know  very  little  about  their  identity  and  how  they  are  wired  together  to  mediate  information processing in the brain. We propose a novel research approach that will enable us to identify the  different  interneuron  cell  types  in  the  CA1  region  of  the  hippocampus  and  determine  their  connectivity  diagram,  which  will  lead  to  a  better  circuit‐level  understanding  of  hippocampal  function  and  more  effective

"CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely  reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference  dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable –the reference point- during value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs  of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.  This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a  behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (“Neuropixels” probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from  the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and  aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we  will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the  neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3). Decision-making is disrupted in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.Moreover,  all major classes of psychiatric disorders are associated with disordered reward processing in the brain.  Therefore, a circuit-level understanding of how the brain computes and represents the reference point  during value-based decision-making has enormous consequences for human health, and may hold  promise for improving treatments for mental health disorders in which decision-making is impaired.",CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics,10261540,R01MH125571,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Capuchin Monkey ', ' Cebus ', ' Ring-Tail Monkey ', ' capuchin ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Theory ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insurance ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Retirement ', ' Rewards ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Savings ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Testing ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' Implant ', ' reward processing ', ' behavioral economics ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,337222,NY-12
"Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity The brain is a complex dynamical system, with a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales ranging from microns and milliseconds to centimeters and years. Activity at any given scale contributes to activity at the scales above it and can influence activity at smaller scales. Thus a true understanding of the brain requires the ability to understand how each level contributes to the system as a whole. Most brain research focuses on a single scale (single unit firing, activity in a circuit), which cannot account for the constraints imposed by activities at other scales. The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework for the integration of multiscalar, multimodal measurements of brain activity. One of the challenges in understanding how activity translates across scales is that features that are relevant at one scale (e.g., firing rate) do not have clear analogues at other scales. We address this issue by defining trajectories in “state space” at each scale, where the state space is defined by parameters and time scales appropriate to each type of data. The trajectory of brain activity through state space can uncover features like attractor dynamics and limit cycles that characterize the evolution of activity. Using machine learning along with new and existing multimodal measurements of brain activity (MRI, optical, and electrophysiological), we propose to establish methods that relate trajectories across scales while handling the mismatch in temporal sampling rates inherent in multi-scale data. Specific aims are 1. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at fast scales influence activity at slower scales. Different modalities have different inherent temporal resolutions in addition to different types of contrast. Current methods generally downsample the faster modality in some way, losing much information in the process. We will leverage variants on long short-term memory (LSTM) network architectures to learn the relationship between state space trajectories acquired simultaneously with population recording and optical imaging, and with optical imaging and fMRI. 2. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at slow scales influence activity at faster scales. Leveraging the same LSTM-based approach, we will learn how slower, larger scale activity affects activity at smaller scales, using whisker stimulation as a test case. We anticipate inclusion of the large scale activity (measured with fMRI or optical imaging) will improve prediction of the response at smaller scales (measured with optical imaging or population recording). Our work will allow us to begin to answer a wide range of questions about how the brain functions (e.g., what type of localized stimulation that will drive the brain to a desired global state? How does modulation of the global brain state affect local information processing?) and provide guidance for future experiments by identifying key features that influence activity across scales. By approaching the whole brain as a complex dynamical system, we will break free from the limitations of previous studies that focus on individual cells or circuits. We also expect our work to stimulate new theories that incorporate multiple scales of activity. The brain is a complex, dynamical system that exhibits structured activity at many different space and time scales. Most existing studies focus on a single scale (for example, spiking of individual neurons or activity in a particular circuit). However, interactions occur across scales and may account for much of the variability observed in the brain. This proposal will develop a framework for integrating data from different scales using machine learning tools. The results will improve our understanding of how the brain functions and serve as a foundation for modeling neuromodulatory treatments for brain disorders.",Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity,10353118,R01EB029857,"['Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' Population ', ' brain research ', ' information processing ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' network architecture ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' long short term memory ', ' long short term memory network ', ' long short term memory neural network ', ' multiscale data ', ' multi-scale data ', ' ']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,131945,GA-05
"Multiple climbing fiber innervation of Purkinje cells in the adult cerebellum The architecture of brain circuits plays an essential role in understanding their function. The discovery of principal concepts in physiology and neurocomputation critically depends on the availability of precise morphological knowledge. A prominent example supporting this notion is the cerebellum, a brain circuit that is involved in motor (and non-motor) control and adaptation. At the center of cerebellar circuits are Purkinje cells, projection neurons that receive thousands of excitatory synapses, which convey sensory information needed for proper motor control. A hallmark feature of these unique neurons is that they have a massive dendrite that is innervated, in the adult brain, by one climbing fiber input. The climbing fiber plays a crucial role in theories of cerebellar supervised learning, and within this conceptual framework provides an instructive signal (here an error signal) guiding plasticity at parallel fiber synapses. More recent studies have, in addition, pointed out roles in reward signaling and noted that climbing fiber-evoked complex spikes occur in response to a variety of sensory stimuli and may also carry motor command signals. These activity-dependent complex spikes are observed in addition to spontaneous complex spikes that occur at an average frequency of about 1Hz. Thus, while we do not know what the exact functions of climbing fiber signaling are, it is obvious that this unusual input provides a core element of cerebellar cortical circuits and to some degree will define its operations. Our discovery – presented here as pilot data – that a subgroup of the entire adult Purkinje cell population (~15%) has two climbing fiber inputs instead of just one, that two inputs are almost exclusively observed in Purkinje cells with two primary dendrites (either separately exiting from the soma, or separating in close proximity to it) and that within this subgroup 20-25% of Purkinje cells show two climbing fiber inputs, leads to the question whether there is a functional significance of this double innervation. Is persistent double climbing fiber innervation of adult Purkinje cells a bug or a feature? In this exploratory study, we plan to examine the basic phenomenon further and to assess whether two separate climbing fiber inputs may signal independently. If the answer to our ‘bug or feature’ question is ‘feature’, we will examine consequences for cerebellar function (e.g. behavioral learning tests) in subsequent studies that we will seek separate funding for. The first aim uses patch-clamp recordings from mice in combination with confocal microscopy in vitro to test the hypothesis that the persistence of multiple climbing fibers is not random, but occurs in Purkinje cells with two primary dendrites. We will also inject tracer dyes into the inferior olive to stain climbing fibers and anatomically confirm the existence of two climbing fiber inputs. The second aim will add calcium imaging in vitro to examine whether a double climbing fiber input leads to functionally separate, dendritic calcium signaling domains. The third aim uses GCaMP6f-based two-photon imaging from Purkinje cells in awake mice to assess whether under spontaneous conditions, or with sensory stimulation, two climbing fiber inputs may operate independently. The microarchitecture of the cerebellum is highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, with the innervation of adult Purkinje cells by a single climbing fiber input as one of its signature characteristics. Pilot studies from our laboratory show that, in contrast to this assumed connectivity pattern, a sizeable subgroup of Purkinje cells with specific dendrite characteristics is innervated by two climbing fiber inputs, thus challenging the traditional view that one dendrite-wide instructive signal, provided by one climbing fiber input, guides the cerebellar control of motor and cognitive functions. Using patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings from Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices as well as two-photon recordings from awake mice, we plan to investigate consequences of double innervation, in particular the question whether two climbing fiber inputs may signal independently.",Multiple climbing fiber innervation of Purkinje cells in the adult cerebellum,10315621,R21NS124217,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Dendrites ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Female ', ' Flowcharts ', ' Fluorescent Dyes ', ' Fluorescence Agents ', ' Fluorescent Agents ', ' fluorescent dye/probe ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Purkinje Cells ', "" Purkinje's Corpuscles "", ' cerebellar Purkinje cell ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Microscopic ', ' Fiber ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' Olives ', ' Olives - dietary ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Tactile ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Contralateral ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Inferior ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' Calcium Ion Signaling ', ' Calcium Signaling ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' patch clamp ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Qualifying ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Excitatory Synapse ', ' Slice ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Instruction ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor control ', ' operation ', ' Injections ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2021,451000,IL-01
"Scalable tools for consistent identification of neuronal cell types in mouse and human Project Summary The proposed work will address a critical gap in our understanding of neuronal phenotypes and cell types by developing machine learning algorithms and cloud-based software for the integration of multiple modality characterizations large and growing datasets of cortical neurons in mouse and human. Through optimal and innovative use of potentially incomplete data and emphasis on automated morphological characterization, the proposed tools will enable richer and consistent characterizations of neurons from transcriptomic, anatomical, or electrophysiological profiling. While large-scale, BICCN-funded cell type research programs rely on the notion of unique neuronal identity which determines the cell’s phenotype across different observation modalities, overarching agreements across physiological, anatomical and molecular characterizations remain elusive. Although these large-scale programs succeeded in generating extensive multiple modality datasets, the lack of principled, accurate and widely available computational alignment and inference tools presents a roadblock to the success of the overall program. A second issue is that anatomical characterization, despite being the classical approach to understanding cell types, lags significantly behind molecular and physiological methods in terms of throughput. The research proposed here aims to address the alignment problem by building on the coupled autoencoder approach, which presents an efficient optimization framework centered on the ubiquity of neuronal identity. Importantly, the proposed software can utilize incompletely characterized data points, which is common in practice, to produce unified visualization and analysis of abstract neuronal identity. This tool will be both flexible (e.g., the feature set can be changed) and extensible (e.g., more observation modalities can be added for joint alignment). The aligned representations enable consistent clustering of the neuronal population across the different observation modalities, which is a pressing problem in modern neuroscience. We propose to address the anatomical throughput issue with an end-to-end computational pipeline, from the raw image of local neuronal arbors to the anatomical descriptor that can be readily aligned and interpreted by the coupled autoencoder software. By utilizing our extensive gold-standard manual reconstructions, we will train supervised deep artificial neural networks to segment neuronal arbors in sparse labeling scenarios. The rich set of training examples, together with algorithmic innovations, will endow superior generalizability of this automated segmentation tool, accelerating science for light microscopy-based studies. Project Narrative The prospect of addressing many questions on the function and dysfunction of the nervous system hinges on the ability to consistently identify the same cell type label for a given cell, independent of the observation modality. While much recent progress has been achieved by jointly characterizing neurons with multiple observation modalities, a lack of software tools that can consistently infer the type and unobserved features of incompletely characterized neurons hinders progress. This work will analyze large and growing single neuron datasets to develop accessible computational methods for relating and harmonizing anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular data.",Scalable tools for consistent identification of neuronal cell types in mouse and human,10365216,RF1MH128778,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Descriptor ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' light microscopy ', ' cell type ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' Agreement ', ' Modality ', ' Property ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Brightfield Analysis ', ' Brightfield Microscopy ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' image archival system ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' image repository ', ' imaging repository ', ' picture archive ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cloud based ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' neural network ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' Visualization ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' computational pipelines ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' patch sequencing ', ' patch-seq ', ' patchseq ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIMH,ALLEN INSTITUTE,RF1,2021,1081350,WA-07
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale.

"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane.

"Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila. Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how complex, multi-action, behavioral variability is generated by neural circuits in the brain. Understanding this process is crucial to understanding how many neurological diseases cause restricted and inappropriate selection of actions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how populations of neurons control the behavioral variability in action selection for complex behaviors. We will utilize the fruit fly to investigate this question because despite having a much simpler brain than humans, the fruit fly performs complex behaviors with high variability. We have found that activating just 24 neurons in the fruit fly brain causes variable expression of four distinct aggressive actions: stopping, wing elevation, leg extension, and lunging. The relative simplicity of this system is ideal for pin-pointing the contribution of different sources of variability: cell-autonomous stochasticity in action potential generation, variability at a network-level or variability in muscles or other neurons affected by the 24 neurons. To test these sources for variability, the project will consist of three main aims. The first is to determine whether the actions are discrete states of behavior or lie within a continuum by using advances in machine learning and neuroethology to automate the identification of the aggressive behavioral actions and the transitions between these actions. The second is to test the hypothesis that each action is caused by neurons with similar neuroanatomical connections using neuroimaging, genetic manipulation, and controlled behavioral experiments. The third is to use functional imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and computational modeling to determine the neural basis for the variability of behavior. By combining theory, experimentation, and modeling, we will be able to provide a systems level explanation of the logic behind why animals perform different actions despite consistent levels of neuronal activation. Project Narrative The ability to flexibly and appropriately perform action selection is altered in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the mechanism behind the variability in action selection while performing complex behaviors is not understood. By quantifying, modeling, and decoding the neural logic behind the variability in action selection of a fruit fly, we aim to build new theories about how our own brain works and provide insight into better treatment of diseases affecting proper execution of behaviors.",Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila.,10269928,F31NS120835,"['Action Potentials ', ' Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Goals ', ' Horns ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Logic ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Probability ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Lateral ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' appendage ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' sensory integration ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' patch clamp ', ' Leg ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' neuroethology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' peanut butter ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036,PA-03
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10226122,R01MH120158,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' cognitive function ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Frequencies ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' reward processing ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' human imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' social defeat ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,706855,NC-04
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10226105,R01MH120292,"['Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Argipressin ', ' Arginine Vasopressin ', ' Vasopressin-Neurophysin II-Copeptin ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Middle Hypothalamus ', ' Intermediate Hypothalamic Region ', ' Medial Hypothalamus ', ' Locales ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Play ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Vasopressins ', ' Antidiuretic Hormone ', ' beta-Hypophamine ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Source ', ' extracellular ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Output ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' motivated behavior ', ' maternal aggression ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' presynaptic ', ' selective expression ', ' selectively expressed ', ' optogenetics ', ' anatomical tracing ', ' anatomical tracer ', ' anatomical tract tracer ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,462162,NY-13
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['Algorithms ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Varicosity ', ' Varices ', ' Varicose Veins ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' dendrite spine ', ' Dendritic Spines ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' cloud based ', ' citizen science ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' petabyte ', ' Infrastructure ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861,WA-07
"Identification and characterization of chromatin regulators of coordinated synaptic gene expression Project Summary/Abstract Nervous system function requires the integration of diverse neuronal subtypes into neural circuits that elicit thought and behavior. Despite the extensive diversity of neuronal subtypes, all neurons share key features, including chemical synapses. Current models indicate that shared neuronal genes, including pan-synaptic genes, are independently regulated by different combinations of transcription factors in distinct neuronal subtypes, whereas subtype-specific synaptic genes are regulated by specific transcription factors called terminal selectors. Our data demonstrate that pan-neuronal and subtype-specific synaptic genes are temporally coordinated during synaptogenesis. We have identified a candidate gene regulatory network (GRN) that includes two known pioneer factors, and propose a model in which positive and negative regulation of chromatin accessibility underlie the coordinated regulation of synaptic gene expression to promote synapse formation. In Aim 1, we propose genomic and in vivo functional validation to test the model that two of our candidate transcription factors, GA-rich motif binding factors CLAMP and GAGA factor, bind to the same promoters of synaptic genes to exert opposite effects on chromatin accessibility and transcription. In Aim 2, we propose a comprehensive and unbiased approach to identifying the GRNs underlying coordinated synaptic gene expression through single-nucleus RNA- and ATAC-Seq. Successful completion of these studies will advance our understanding of how the development of shared neuronal traits is coordinated with cell fate acquisition, and may inform neuronal reprogramming of stem cells. Project Narrative The nervous system is remarkable for its cellular diversity and functional complexity, yet despite extensive diversity, all neurons share key features such as chemical synapses. While pan- neuronal and sub-type specific genes are thought to be regulated through distinct mechanisms, our data demonstrate that these classes of synaptic genes are temporally coordinated during synaptogenesis.

"Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals adapt their hearing to perceive features of sound that are important for successful behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to detect and discriminate important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings. Even when they can perceive sounds accurately, the additional listening effort required negatively impacts other cognitive functions. A better understanding of how the healthy auditory system operates in cognitively challenging contexts will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will study how the auditory system represents sound information as it operates in challenging acoustic environments. There are three specific aims. First, high-density microelectrode arrays will be used to record the simultaneous activity of neural populations in auditory cortex during behaviors that require detecting sounds masked by noise or learning new sound-reward associations. Recording from multiple neurons will enable characterizing how information is encoded by the simultaneous activity of neural populations. These experiments will test the hypothesis that population activity in auditory cortex generates representations that are invariant to irrelevant distracting sounds. Second, optogenetic tools will be used to identify distinct neuronal cell types (excitatory versus inhibitory) in cortex. This study will test the hypothesis that tonic activation of inhibitory neurons can explain changes in population activity during behavior. Third, machine learning tools will be used to model the simultaneously recorded neural activity. These experiments will test the hypothesis that neurons in the same local anatomical circuit in auditory cortex encode information about a relatively small domain in the space of all possible auditory stimuli. Models fit to experimental data will also describe how changes in behavioral state shift the way neurons encode sounds and describe sources of correlated population activity that impact neural discriminability during behavior. Together these experiments will establish new links between neural representation of sound and the cognitive processes that extract important information from sound for successful behavior. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairment and central neurological disorders have difficulty keeping track of speech and other complex sounds, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how populations of neurons in auditory cortex change their activity as the brain adapts to noisy environments. These experiments will provide insight into basic function of the healthy brain that can inform treatment of hearing disorders.",Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior,10302718,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Auditory Perceptual Disorders ', ' Acoustic Perceptual Disorder ', ' Auditory Comprehension Disorder ', ' Auditory Perceptual Diseases ', ' Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Psychoacoustical Disorders ', ' central processing disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Crowding ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Ferrets ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Learning ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Pupil ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' receptive field ', ' Individual ', ' Hearing problem ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' auditory disease ', ' auditory disorder ', ' auditory dysfunction ', ' auditory problem ', ' hearing disease ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Auditory system ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Operating System ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neural model ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' auditory processing ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' normal hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,320591,OR-03
"Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing Project Summary Vocal communication depends on distinguishing our own vocal sounds (vocal feedback) from other sounds. Vocal motor-related corollary discharge (vocal CD) signals that suppress auditory responses to predictable vocal feedback help make this distinction. Notably, vocal CD signals in the human auditory cortex are especially important to speech and their dysfunction is thought to cause auditory hallucinations. Despite the key roles postulated for vocal CD signals, the challenges of monitoring and manipulating their activity in vocalizing animals has prevented systematic analyses. The long-term objective of this application is to understand with synaptic, cellular, and circuit resolution how vocal CD signals modulate auditory cortical responses to vocal feedback, detailed knowledge of which is essential to understand adaptive and maladaptive aspects of audition. We will gain detailed knowledge of synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying this process by studying the mouse, the vertebrate most suited to advanced genetic, electrophysiological, and optical tools. In the prior funding period, we used these tools to advance our understanding the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which movement-related CD signals modulate auditory cortical activity. These advances included mapping a motor to auditory cortical circuit, determining that various head and body movements activate this pathway to suppress auditory cortical responses to sounds, and showing that this pathway can “learn” to selectively suppress sounds that are predictably yoked to locomotor movements. We also observed auditory cortical suppression in vocalizing male mice, but vocalization occurred during female courtship and was always accompanied by other movements, as well as by social and sexual stimuli. Therefore, whether vocalization-specific CD signals modulate the auditory cortex and suppress predictable vocal feedback remain unknown. Fortunately, we also developed methods for optogenetically gating ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and for distorting vocal feedback in the isolated, head-fixed mouse. Here we propose to combine these methods with other state of the art techniques, including multi-electrode arrays, in vivo multiphoton imaging, controlled manipulation of vocalization-related auditory feedback, and novel computational methods for voco-acoustic analysis. In the first Aim, we will test the idea that vocalization suppresses auditory cortical activity and use machine learning methods to rigorously quantify and compare spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked USVs. In the second Aim, we will isolate cortical contributions to the vocal modulation of auditory cortical activity. In the third Aim, we will distort vocal feedback to determine if vocal suppression of the auditory cortex is predictive, and use computational methods to systematically quantify vocal distortion. Together, these Aims will provide novel insights into the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms by which vocal CD signals influence auditory cortical processing. Project Narrative Normal hearing depends on the brain’s ability to anticipate and suppress responses to self-generated vocal sounds, while impaired suppression generates auditory hallucinations. We aim to show how vocal motor signals suppress auditory activity in the brain, thus informing how hearing works in health and disease.",Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing,10121250,R01DC013826,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Behavior ', ' Bone Conduction ', ' bone conduction hearing ', ' bone-conducted hearing ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Courtship ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' Locomotion ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Production ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Pyramidal Cells ', ' Auditory Hallucination ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Head Movements ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' vocalization ', ' Auditory system ', ' auditory feedback ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Ultrasonic ', ' Ultrasonics ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' Impairment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' multiphoton imaging ', ' multi-photon imaging ', ' auditory processing ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' deaf ', ' deafened ', ' profound hearing loss ', ' normal hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,429899,NC-04
"Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision- making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the mammalian brain.  Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment. The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without perceptual confidence.  These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive- compulsive and psychotic disorders. Project narrative This proposal aims to identify the computational algorithms of two confidence-guided behaviors, time investment and choice strategy updating, and the neural processes underlying these. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, viral tracing, optogenetics in a quantitative confidence-reporting behavior in rats, interpreted with computational modeling and statistical analysis.

"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9902565,U24NS109520,"['Adoption ', ' Animals ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Communities ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Posture ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Pythons ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' voltage ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' graduate student ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' Instruction ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' data format ', ' natural language ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine vision ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2021,466672,MA-07
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,10150927,R01NS113078,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Association Learning ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscimol ', ' Agarin ', ' Pantherine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Purkinje Cells ', "" Purkinje's Corpuscles "", ' cerebellar Purkinje cell ', ' Rabies virus ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Reading ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Dentate nucleus ', ' nucleus dentatus ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Fractals ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Agonist ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' visual learning ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' human disease ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor control ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Injections ', ' Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network ', ' eMERGE Consortium ', ' eMERGE Network ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,1026631,NY-13
"Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition, emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. This proposal examines the neural mechanisms underlying interactions between emotional and motor memory systems during associative learning.

"Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT How the brain generates the correct number of neurons and how these neurons determine the size of their arbors to innervate the receptor field is a critical question in neurobiology. The Drosophila visual system is hard wired and iteratively organized into columns, providing an excellent model to answer these questions. Drosophila medulla multicolumnar neurons exhibit 5 to 750 neurons per cell type; each neuron class possesses a distinct morphology and projects its arbors across multiple columns in the optic lobe. The host lab has obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data that determined the transcriptome of almost all optic lobe neuron cell types throughout development. The first aim of this project is to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that dictate neuron number. Under the mentorship of Claude Desplan at New York University (K99 phase), I will perform genetics experiments that decisively address the role of programmed cell death, neural stem cell division number, and neuroepithelial size of origin in regulating the number of multicolumnar neurons produced. I will also perform lineage tracing experiments to determine whether molecularly similar cell types are generated at the same time. With Holger Knaut at NYU Medical Center, I will learn quantitative live imaging techniques to distinguish whether neural stem cells divide a limited number of times to generate low-abundance neural classes, or whether cell fusion of immature progenitors drives cell number. The second aim of this project is to determine the morphological and genetic processes that dictate the size and orientation of the arbors of multicolumnar to allow them to cover distinct receptor fields. With the bioinformatics expertise of Itai Yanai at NYU Medical Center, I will perform RNAseq on adult neurons that are not numerous enough to be identified in our existing scRNAseq data sets. I will then use machine learning algorithms to identify these neurons during development in our existing scRNAseq libraries and thus identify candidate genes required for the regulation of neuron number and arbor size (R00 phase). I will combine these molecular experiments with live imaging to quantitatively characterize how multicolumnar neurons determine the orientation and size of their arbors. Preliminary data indicates that cell death and the size of neuroepithelial region of origin in part dictate multicolumnar neuron number; I have also identified a neuropeptide whose function is essential for the regulation of neuron arbor size. My work will clarify the molecular basis of neuron abundance and determine how neurons present in small numbers regulate their arbor size to ensure that their environment is uniformly sampled, a problem common to many brain regions in most species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how neurons are generated in the correct numbers and how they appropriately space their arbors is of relevance to the fields of developmental neurobiology, neurology and regenerative medicine. Failure to properly specify or target neurons may cause congenital neurological diseases, and our work may identify molecular targets used for treatment. Comprehension of how neurons are made and how they target is also of relevance to regenerative medicine, as stem cell therapies will soon be able to generate diverse neural types which may be transplanted to treat blindness, brain injury and neurodegeneration.",Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size,10104237,K99EY032269,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Biology ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Ganglia ', ' Neural Ganglion ', ' Goals ', ' Kinetics ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mosaicism ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' New York ', ' Optic Lobe ', ' Corpora Bigemina ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Retina ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Comprehension ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Neuropil ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Medical center ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' developmental neurobiology ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' neuroblast ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stem cell based therapy ', ' stem cell mediated therapy ', ' stem cell therapeutics ', ' stem cell treatment ', ' stem cell-based treatment ', ' stem cell therapy ', ' neuroepithelium ', ' Neural Stem Cell ', ' neural precursor ', ' neural precursor cell ', ' neural progenitor ', ' neural progenitor cells ', ' neuron progenitors ', ' neuronal progenitor ', ' neuronal progenitor cells ', ' neuronal stem cells ', ' neuroprogenitor ', ' nerve stem cell ', ' Genetic Processes ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' stem cell renewal ', ' stem cell division ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Cell fusion ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Inhibition of Apoptosis ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Mutate ', ' Cell Death Inhibition ', ' Neuroepithelial ', ' Transcript ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' Population ', ' somatosensory ', ' progenitor ', ' retinotopic ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,140333,NY-12
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Genes ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 ', ' MeCP-2 protein ', ' MeCP2 ', ' MeCP2 protein ', ' Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 ', ' Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ', ' Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2 ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Medial ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Synaptic Potentials ', ' Long-Term Potentiation ', ' Longterm Potentiation ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Link ', ' Fiber ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Contralateral ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Long-Term Synaptic Depression ', ' longterm depression ', ' longterm synaptic depression ', ' Long-Term Depression ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Mutate ', ' in vivo ', ' Excitatory Synapse ', ' Slice ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' spatial memory ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' voltage sensitive dye ', ' potentiometric dye ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' postnatal development ', ' post-natal development ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603,AL-07
"Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits Behaviors such as action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging due to the involvement of multiple brain areas and due to the fact that such behaviors involve multiple timescales, from the granular level of moment-to-moment limb control to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. Modern experiments, which are able to record from large numbers of neurons in behaving animals, and in some cases to do so simultaneously in multiple brain areas and throughout the learning of a task, are providing a path forward for addressing these challenges. The overall goal of my research is to facilitate the synthesis and understanding of data from such experiments by constructing models of the brain circuits relevant for a given behavior, addressing how the neural activity in these circuits relates to behavior and how it is shaped over time through learning. In recent work, I have developed expertise in learned dynamics in neural circuits through three related lines of research. First, I have modeled the neural computations underlying timing-related behavior and its implementation in the basal ganglia. Second, I have mathematically derived biologically plausible learning rules to underlie supervised learning of time-dependent tasks in recurrent neural networks. Finally, I have worked on a theory-experiment collaboration in which modeling with recurrent neural networks was used in tandem with brain-machine interface experiments in monkeys to address the structure of neural representations within primary motor cortex. In future work, I will build on this experience to address how dynamical neural activity patterns are learned in order to produce complex behaviors over both short and long timescales. One way to begin addressing this question is with the theory of reinforcement learning, which provides a rich and powerful framework for addressing how actions should be performed in order to maximize future rewards. Given their established role in implementing reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia form the starting point for my proposed research program. I first aim to revise the classical model of basal ganglia function by constructing and mathematically analyzing models that solve computationally challenging tasks and by comparing the results with new data from my experimental collaborators (Aim 1). Building on this work, and making use of my prior experience training recurrent neural networks to model motor tasks, I will next consider learning in motor cortex and how it complements learning in basal ganglia (Aim 2), again comparing models with new experimental data. Finally, I will construct models of the thalamocortico-basal ganglia circuit by incorporating knowledge about the neural representations throughout this circuit and by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. In this way I will address how the mammalian brain implements hierarchical reinforcement learning to integrate behaviors over short and long timescales (Aim 3). Taken together, this research will advance understanding of how neural activity facilitates action selection and sequencing in complex behaviors. Behaviors involving action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging because multiple brain areas are involved and because such behaviors may involve multiple timescales, from low-level limb movements to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. By developing circuit models of the basal ganglia and their cortical inputs, using new data from my experimental collaborators to inform and test these models, and drawing on recent advances in reinforcement learning from the field of machine learning, I will advance the understanding of how learned motor behaviors are implemented in the brain.",Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits,10296960,R00NS114194,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' limb movement ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' theories ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' neural model ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' mathematical analysis ', ' math analysis ', ' mathematics analysis ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' neural network ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R00,2021,249000,OR-04
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Rapid Evaluation of Neuronal Activity in the Intact Whole Brain at Single Cell Resolution Project Summary  Here we seek to develop a “Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic” platform and reagent kits to disseminate accessible products for measuring recent neural activity across the entire mouse brain to the neuroscience community. Previously we have shown that the activity-dependent immediate-early gene protein products Npas4 and cFos can be clearly detected, imaged, and quantified using developmental versions of our platform tools. Immediate early genes are genes that are activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. The three overlapping aims to be investigated in this Phase II project are:  1) Demonstration of the fidelity of our assay for our customers. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our neuronal activity assay with another well-known assay for activity, we will perform two photon calcium fluorescence imaging in the primary visual cortex of mice presented with repeated visual stimuli. We will clear and stain the brains for cFos and Npas4 and demonstrate the fidelity of these markers for detecting recently active neurons.  2) Develop and beta test robust versions of our software tools useable by researchers with no specialized coding or statistics knowledge. We will develop Stitchy and BrainSnap into robust, user-friendly software products that remove the current analysis bottleneck for neuroscientists interested in whole-brain imaging. Stitchy will be an improved browser-based version of our internal software that simplifies and speeds the process of stitching together light sheet microscope images. BrainSnap software will integrate our high-performance 3TK- Quant framework for machine learning-enabled quantification and our statistical framework for whole-brain anatomics, 3TK-Stats, in a browser-based interface. We have recruited end users who will test this software in a head-to-head comparison with our in-house testing.  3) Develop and test a brain clearing and staining kit for neuronal activity. To help researchers produce high quality cleared brains stained with neuronal activity markers, we will generate Neuronal Activity clearing and staining reagents kits for cFos and Npas4. These will be tested by collaborators in head-to-head comparisons with our in-house procedures on brains prepared in parallel.  At the end of Phase II, Translucence will have a market-ready Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic platform including reagent kits, user-friendly software, and service options. Project Narrative Translucence uses cutting-edge technology to make brains optically clear coupled with computational tools to map and quantify neuronal activity at single-cell resolution across the entire mouse brain.

"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10348398,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,79818,TX-30
"The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative Music is a powerful memory cue that can reliably transport us to our past -- in  effect, strengthening the associative bond between our present and our past. Modern  neuroscientific investigations of episodic memory could benefit from the use of music due to its  role as a potent memory cue. In this proposal, my goal is to understand how music shapes memory   for past events and how these associations between events are represented in the brain.  The proposed work builds on recent functional MRI studies that have used naturalistic experimental  paradigms such as movie watching and recall to test and refine theories of memory  that (previously) had only been tested under highly-controlled conditions. Here we explore how film  scores shape memory for movies. In movies, film scores sometimes have recurrent structure where a  particular theme song will be repeated throughout, potentially bringing back to mind information  from previous events in which that theme song had been played. Based on prior work showing   that retrieval of a memory strengthens that memory, we predict that the presence of  recurrent musical structure in a film will trigger retrieval of previous events during  movie-watching, which (in turn) will boost memory for these events on a later recall test. In our  study, two groups of participants are recruited: The first group watches a version of a movie in  its original form (with the film score intact) and the control group watches the same film with the  entire film score removed (while preserving dialogue and ambient sounds). Participants from both  groups are asked to return the following day to recall the entire movie in chronological order. By  comparing neural activity between scenes containing music and previous scenes containing the same  (or similar) music between the two groups, we expect to find evidence of neural reinstatement of  past scenes in the music group; furthermore, we predict that higher levels of reinstatement during  movie-viewing will be associated with better subsequent recall of the movie in the music group  relative to the control group. This work will provide basic-science insight into how memory works  in real-world contexts. It will also shed light on how musical cues can strengthen memories and  improve recall; if the predicted cueing effects are observed, these techniques could be used in  future work to boost performance in memory-impaired clinical populations. The effects of music on memory in naturalistic settings are not yet well understood. In this  project, we aim to study how memory for films is affected by the presence or absence of the film  score and whether these effects can be measured neurally. This work will help develop new  neural measures of music-evoked episodic memory as well as expand our understanding of music's  effect on memory under natural conditions.",The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative,10334404,F99NS118740,"['Affect ', ' Association Learning ', ' Award ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chronology ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Memory ', ' Modernization ', ' Music ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Distant ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' memory retrieval ', ' memory recall ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' theories ', ' portability ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,47036,NJ-12
"A neurocomputational assay of gastrointestinal interoception in anorexia nervosa PROJECT SUMMARY Given that anorexia nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness and current treatments show limited efficacy, there is a crucial need to better understand the brain mechanisms driving the pathophysiology of this disorder. This proposal combines an experimental medicine approach focused on gastrointestinal (GI) interoception with computational modeling to probe neural circuits of interoception and appetite-related gastric processing in AN. The goal is to identify perceptual and neural markers for AN at the individual patient level and apply machine learning methods to test clinical outcomes prediction longitudinally. Supported by our preliminary data, this proposal is based on the premise that the pathophysiology of AN includes a computational dysfunction manifested by cognitive suppression of the expected precision of afferent interoceptive signals associated with hunger, which reduces their motivational influence and facilitates maladaptive and avoidant eating behaviors. We propose a case-control study with 65 AN and 65 healthy comparisons who will undergo extensive baseline testing using a novel GI interoception probe during measurement of symptoms, behavior, circuits, and physiology. Sensory stimulation will occur during the premeal period, anchoring responses to an anticipatory context with high relevance to the disorder. These individuals will be followed for 180 days to examine clinical outcomes. A computational approach will examine the basic hypothesis that AN individuals have lower sensory precision for GI interoception and that the degree of sensory imprecision is related to clinical characteristics. Moreover, we will examine the relationship of this imprecision to circuit and physiological measures. We will then apply machine learning approaches to these neurophysiological and perceptual measures to longitudinally test the prediction of clinical outcomes. Achieving the aims of this project will provide unique insights into the pathophysiology of AN by arbitrating whether AN is a consequence of “top-down” or “bottom-up” dysregulation in the nervous system, which could transform our understanding of how intrinsic interoceptive disturbances lead to AN. Pragmatically, it will result in new technologies for identifying interoceptive dysfunction at the individual level, allowing psychiatry to develop diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of AN. Thus the neurocomputational assay of gastrointestinal interoception in AN could be used to develop low-cost, scalable, and objective tools for identifying dysfunction in individual patients, to facilitate neurobiologically-based definitions of recovery, and to predict the risk of relapse following treatment. Finally, this proposal lays the groundwork for the future development of precision psychiatric interventions such as perceptual retraining therapies to target (and recalibrate) abnormal brain- body interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Anorexia nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness, yet we have a poor understanding of the biological causes of this disorder. In this proposal we examine the basic question of whether individuals with AN have poorer “gut sensations” which enable them to fast and lose weight despite severe medical consequences.

"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10198670,F31MH124323,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human Activities ', ' Independent Living ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Societies ', ' Task Performances ', ' Technology ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase ', ' CRE Recombinase ', ' bacteriophage P1 recombinase Cre ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Walking ', ' Custom ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Medial Dorsal Nucleus ', ' Dorsomedial Nucleus ', ' Dorsomedial Nucleus of the Thalamus ', ' Dorsomedial Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Mediodorsal Nucleus ', ' Mediodorsal Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Life ', ' longterm memory ', ' long term memory ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Supermarket ', ' empowered ', ' calcium indicator ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Motor ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Implant ', ' memory encoding ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' sensory input ', ' self-directed learning ', ' independent learning ', ' self-regulated learning ', ' microendoscope ', ' endomicrosope ', ' Injections ', ' Grain ', ' social relationships ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,46036,NY-13
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation.

"Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach. Project Summary Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female- specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1α neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1α neurons. For this aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1α neurons; and b) pC1α neurons project dendritic outputs to PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1α neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2 will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1α neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression mediating neurons also play key role in pC1α neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g, activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human Aβ-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and (cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. Project Narrative Aggression accompanies a number of common human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and other related dementias), with little understanding of how cognitive and aggression symptoms may be linked at the neuronal level. Aggression has been extensively studied in males of many species, but neglected in females (likewise, the interaction of sex and age is neglected). The objective of this research program is to identify the neural circuitry that governs female aggression (K99- mentored phase) and later transition (R00- independent phase) into discovering mechanisms of dementia-related pathology and how these changes affect aggression.",Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology

"Discovering the molecular genetic principles of cell type organization through neurobiology-guided computational analysis of single cell multi-omics data sets ABSTRACT Understanding the biological principles of cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function. The recent rapid accumulation of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data sets provides unprecedented opportunity to explore the molecular genetic basis of cell type identity, diversity, and organization. However, analysis of multi-omics datasets have been largely driven by statistic methods that typically do not engage the deep knowledge of neurobiology and developmental biology. As such, most statistic methods do not distinguish technical noise and methodological biases from biologically relevant signals and relationships, and have limited power in achieving biological discovery and insight. Neurobiology guided feature selection based on inherent physiological and developmental processes is essential to move beyond simple statistical clustering of molecular types towards achieving multi-modal definition of neuron types and revealing their inherent relationships as a taxonomy. We have discovered that transcriptional architectures of synaptic input/output (I/O) communication may underlie the essence of cortical GABAergic neuron identity. We hypothesize that transcriptional architectures of synaptic communication is a general defining feature for brain neuron types. We will test this hypothesis by performing a series of supervised learning and feature selection analyses of publically available and emerging single sc-transcriptomic data sets across brain areas and systems from the BRIAN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN). We further hypothesize that cell type transcriptional signatures of synaptic communication is orchestrated by well-defined gene regulatory programs rooted in epignomic landscape. We will test this hypothesis by joint analysis of sc-transcriptome, ATACseq, and DNA methylome dataset of the same cortical cell populations from BICCN to identify co-expressed gene signatures that reliably define cell identity, focusing on signatures of synaptic communication. Based on transcriptomic and epigenomic architecture of synaptic communication, we will further develop neurobiology guided feature selection algorithms to improve and refine the current statistical clustering the cortical transcriptomic types. In addition, we will generate web portal tools for automated classification of transcriptomic cell types. Our study will establish a unified paradigm of neuronal cell type organization in which epignomic landscape configures core gene regulatory programs to shape synaptic communication properties that define cardinal neuron types. Together, this work will establish a molecular genetic framework for understanding neuronal diversity and achieving a biological classification across brain areas and mammalian species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the biological principles of neuronal cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function and disorders. We will develop and apply supervised machine learning – based algorithms to the analysis of the rapidly accumulating single cell molecular genetics data sets across the mammalian species from the BRAIN Initiative.

"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes.

"Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition Project Summary The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains, including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology, study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alters focal and diffuse networks and has recently been posited as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. This project aims to evaluate the the role of electrophysiological networks involved in NMDA receptor hypofunction and utilize DBS to improve cognitive behavior.",Septohippocampal circuit deep brain

"Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression Project Summary  Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Human aggression is typically demarcated as exhibiting either reactive (defensive) or appetitive (rewarding) components, and a growing literature indicates they are heavily influenced by dysregulation in amygdalar or reward circuitry, respectively. Despite a significant clinical awareness of the fundamental differences between these aggression presentations, direct preclinical characterization of their relative circuitry and associated neuronal mechanisms are currently absent. Therefore, the aim of my proposal is to obtain the obtain the necessary computational, behavioral and anatomical training to identify, interrogate, and manipulate neural populations that modulate these disparate aggressive behaviors.  This project will focus on identifying lateral septum (LS) circuit and cell-type specific mechanisms that control of reactive versus appetitive aggression, and then further interrogate the afferent projections driving these populations. The choice of this brain region is based on converging preliminary data, including my own, implicating that the LS may confer opposing roles in regulating appetitive versus reactive aggression. The circuit and cell-type specific activation of the LS will be identified using a combination of Fos (a marker of neuronal activity) immunohistochemistry, multiplex in situ hybridization, and retrograde viral tracing. Because of the limited temporal resolution of Fos during these behaviors, awake-behaving fiber photometry recording will be used to observe how LS neurons encode these types of aggression in real-time. Next, the causal significance of the LS and its afferent projections will be examined using region, circuit, and cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving these types of aggression will allow for the development of more specific and effective treatments for maladaptive aggression presenting comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Despite a long-standing knowledge of the deleterious effects of maladaptive aggression, current treatment options are largely used as pharmacological restraints rather than targeted therapies. The aim of this proposal is to seek out and establish new mechanisms underlying reactive and appetitive aggression, possibly revealing novel therapeutic targets with higher efficacy and decreased off-target effects.",Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression,10150355,F31MH125587,"['Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Breeding ', ' Calcium ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Photometry ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Time ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Lateral ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' increased appetite ', ' Appetite stimulated ', ' Increased food appetite ', ' increased hunger ', ' insight ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' restraint ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' reward circuitry ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' optogenetics ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' neuroethology ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' Injections ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2021,43944,WA-07
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10201770,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,353797,TX-30
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,10093973,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Punishment ', ' Pupil ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' zebra finch ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vocalization ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Motor Pathways ', ' Property ', ' vocal learning ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' stem ', ' optogenetics ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' tutoring ', ' tutorial support ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' ']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38255,NC-04
"Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism, including: excitation to inhibition (E/I) imbalance, hyper- or hypo- connectivity profiles, abnormal processing along the cortical column, increased variability of sensory encoding, failure of “canonical” cortical computations, and others. Nevertheless, we currently lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. This critical knowledge deficit needs to be corrected. Identifying common themes of neural circuit dysfunction in autism would yield new targets for intervention, potentially opening new windows for restoring function. Methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome is caused by duplication of the MECP2 gene, leading to progressive intellectual disability and autism in males with 100% penetrance. It is the “mirror image” of Rett syndrome, caused by loss of MECP2 function. Abnormal synaptic plasticity and E/I imbalance have been causally implicated in both MECP2-disorders and autism in general and are known to affect cortical function. Notably, we and others have shown that visual function is abnormal in MECP2-syndromes. Visual cortex, a prototypical “low level” sensory area, renders itself optimally for studying cortical sensory processing. Here, we mount a comprehensive effort to understand how sensory processing fails in MECP2-duplication syndrome, by studying the visual cortex. Recent advances will allow us for the first time to map densely, at single cell resolution, the functional properties and connectome of a cortical column, one of the fundamental modules of cortical computation, in the MECP2-duplication mouse model of autism (aim #1). This will be followed by a detailed electro-physiological connectivity analysis of the cortical circuit to probe underlying mechanisms (aim #2). Data obtained will be used in conjunction with deep learning techniques to create a sophisticated neuro-realistic model of the cortical circuit, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it (aim #3). Hypotheses formulated “in computo” can then be tested optogenetically, closing the loop. Expectations: 1) Obtain the first comprehensive picture of how early sensory processing fails in this model of autism. 2) Identify specific sub-network connectivity defects reflecting abnormal interneuronal connectivity and E/I balance, 3) Construct a neuro-realistic model of the cortical microcircuit, which can be used to uncover “in computo” the mechanism of dysfunction and to probe how one might intervene to repair it. Finally, we will 4) develop a systematic framework, within which to categorize cortical processing and dysfunction in autism. In the future, additional models of autism will be brought into this fold to be categorized and systematically studied. Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders. Nevertheless, we currently lack a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. Here we undertake an effort to densely map cortical circuit properties and connectivity in the MECP2-duplication syndrome of autism and use this information to create a neuro-realistic cortical circuit model, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it. 1",Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism,10121643,R01NS113890,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Physiology ', ' Probability ', ' Retina ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 ', ' MeCP-2 protein ', ' MeCP2 ', ' MeCP2 protein ', ' Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 ', ' Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ', ' Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2 ', ' Area ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' Penetrance ', ' visual processing ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' Reporting ', ' Column of Bertini ', ' Renal Column of Bertini ', ' Cortical Column ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patch clamp ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Defect ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' area V1 ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' therapeutic target ', ' neural patterning ', ' optogenetics ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' connectome ', ' MeCP2 Duplication Syndrome ', ' methyl CpG-binding protein 2 duplication syndrome ', ' deep learning ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694774,MA-07
"Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for the spread of misfolded tau protein Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (tau), are by far the most correlated pathology for clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs, such as exosomes and microvesicles), transfer pathological tau between cells as vehicles, propagating tau pathology. It is urgently important to find the molecular basis of brain-derived EVs, which may critically regulate EV uptake by neurons and aggregation of tau protein in EVs and/or recipient neurons. We have recently established the method for isolating EVs from human brain samples and successfully performed their proteomic profiling. We found that selective molecules from the EV proteomics datasets were able to differentiate human AD-EV from healthy control (CTRL)-EV with 88% accuracy by machine learning analysis, confirming pathogenic character of AD-EV molecules. Furthermore, our exciting preliminary data have shown that AD-EV have significantly higher tau seeding activity compared to CTRL-EV by FRET sensor tau seeding assay with subsets of EV molecules showing significant association with tau seeding activity. This proposed project will fortify these preliminary results and find the converging or specific mechanisms among tauopathies for mediating tau aggregation and its seeding via EV uptake through proteomics and biological examination of brain-derived EV samples. To meet this challenge, we assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have a strong record of accomplishments in biologic (Ikezu), proteomic (Emili) and bioengineering and bioinformatic analysis (Issador). In Aim1, we will examine EV samples from 240 new brain specimens (40 AD, 40 CTE, 40 LBD, 40 PSP, 40 CBD and 40 CTRL) for precision mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and tau-interactomes, and analyze those datasets by the machine learning approach. Aim 2 will examine the efficiency of tau propagation using tau fibrils, oligomers and EVs isolated from the same donors of the 5 different tauopathies and control cases in vitro and in vivo using FRET-based tau seeding assay and EV uptake by primary cultured mouse cortical neurons in vitro. EV-associated tau will be further characterized by the biochemical and microscopy-based analysis for their conformational and posttranslational changes. We will evaluate the difference in tau propagation after the intracranial injection of the tau seeds from different tauopathy brains using our recently established mouse models. Aim3 will identify candidate molecules most likely involved in EV uptake and tau seeding activity by bioinformatic analysis of the proteome dataset (Aim 1) and biological datasets (Aim 2). We will then test the functional roles of the identified molecules on EV uptake, tau seeding activities and neuronal firing activities in vitro. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by gene silencing or antagonists for their therapeutic potential to halt tau propagation in vitro and in vivo. Successful identification of responsible molecules for tau propagation will serve as a foundation for understanding EV-mediated disease progression. We propose to achieve highly comprehensive characterization of the protein composition of extracellular vesicles in human brain tissues, and determine their emerging roles on enhancing neuronal uptake of vesicle associated tau and spread of tau pathology in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by specific antagonistic reagents for their therapeutic potential for halting tau propagation in vivo. These studies will lead to a better understanding of vesicle-mediated disease spread mechanism in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathy.",Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for

"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation.

"Comprehensive and multi-resolution mapping of cell morphology and wiring through X-ray holographic nano-tomography Project Summary / Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is understanding how information is processed in neuronal circuits. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron’s function is dependent on how it is connected, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How do we approach such a complex computational system? Recent advances in X-ray microscopy, electron microscopy, and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and connectivity. The cerebellum is an excellent system to scale and validate a new platform to systematically reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently studied to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and their connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to scale and validate our next-generation X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH) platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently established in our labs to disentangle a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit and cell type organization, and may help us determine the role of specific cell types in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles of cell types in the cerebellum. We will develop and scale X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH) to extract the anatomy and connectivity of cerebellar cell types.

"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation.

"Circuit basis of social behavior decision-making in a subcortical network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal responds to an FOA (RFA-NS-18-030) calling for 1) “novel approaches to understand neural circuitry associated with well-defined social behaviors;” 2) Distributed circuits that contribute to the coordination of motivational states and reward behavior;” 3) “Empirical and analytical approaches to understand how behavioral states are emergent properties of the interaction of neurons, circuits and networks.” The study of subcortical circuits that control conserved, naturalistic behaviors is crucial to understanding brain function. We aim to understand how dynamic interactions between different circuit nodes in the Hypothalamic-Extended Amygdala Decision (“HEAD”) network control innate social behavior decisions, e.g., between aggressive and reproductive behaviors. We propose an integrated approach to this problem that combines microendoscopic imaging (MEI) of genetically identified neuronal subpopulations with automated, machine learning-based classification of social behavior in freely moving mice, together with functional perturbations of neuronal activity in vivo. Our broad, long-term objective is to understand how distributed activity among interconnected structures in the HEAD network controls moment-to-moment decisions between competing goal-directed behaviors that are crucial for the survival of animals and humans. The central objective of this proposal is to understand how information flows through this network during social interactions, and is decoded to control the decision to engage in reproductive vs. aggressive social behaviors. To understand how activity in “upstream” nodes controls neural representations in “downstream” nodes, we will implement a novel approach combining reversible chemogenetic inhibition of the former with concurrent imaging of neuronal population activity in the latter. The rationale for this approach is that an understanding of the system requires characterizing the effects of functional manipulations on both behavioral and circuit-level phenotypes. To achieve our objective, we will first characterize the neural coding of behavior and conspecific sex identity in multiple nodes of the extended amygdala, using single-site microendoscopic imaging and computational analytic approaches (Aim 1); determine how perturbations in the activity of such nodes influence representations in hypothalamic nodes (Aim 2); investigate the roles of intra- and inter-nuclear interactions in determining the balance of activity between aggression and reproduction-promoting hypothalamic nodes (Aim 3); determine how this balance is decoded by downstream mid-brain structures to determine the type of social behavior to express (Aim 4). This contribution is significant because it represents a systems-level approach to understanding how a subcortical network controls behavioral decision-making. The contribution is innovative because it integrates analysis of neuronal population activity, quantitative measurement of naturalistic social behavior and functional perturbations of activity in specific neuronal subpopulations to gain insight into how distributed neural circuits control survival behaviors, in a context that is relevant to maladaptations causing human psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is aimed at developing and applying new approaches to understanding how mammalian subcortical brain circuits control evolutionarily conserved naturalistic social behaviors, which may be disrupted in human psychiatric disorders. Our objective is to construct better, high-resolution maps of neural activity dynamics in the brain during social behavior, by imaging from multiple brain sites in a circuit, and using machine learning algorithms (AI) to automatically extract and measure social behavior from video recordings, thereby enabling precise, quantitative correlations between distributed brain activity and behavior.

"From diverse dynamics to diverse computation via neural cell types Project Summary A prominent feature of biological neuronal networks is the astonishing diversity of their cell types. Major, nationally coordinated experimental efforts, including the BRAIN Initiative’s Cell Census Network (BICCN) and the Allen Institute Cell Types programs, are currently revealing this cellular diversity at new and very high levels of resolution. For example, just across two areas of mouse cortex 133 cell types have been characterized, with many types shared across areas! Similar cell classes have been observed across species. These types show marked differences not only gene expression and connectivity, but also membrane, spiking, and synaptic dynamics. This is in sharp contrast to most computational and theoretical models of learning in neural networks, which generally make use of only one or a small number of cell types. The goal of this project is to produce new computational and theoretical tools to help close this gap. This will enable us, and the broader community, to test a hypothesis for the functional role of cell-type specific, heterogeneous cellular and synaptic dynamics: that they can be harnessed to generate complex network dynamics which allows faster or more accurate learning of tasks which themselves have inputs or objectives which have complex dynamics. Such tasks abound in natural environments. Testing this hypothesis requires new high-throughput computational tools to train neural networks with biologically realistic dynamics and connectivity to solve tasks, new theoretical tools to understand how diverse cellular dynamics contribute to network computation, and new application to large-scale, cellular data-driven models. First, with the expertise of a grant-supported scientific software engineer, will build, test, and disseminate a software package that flexibly implements heterogeneous dynamics of single cells and short-term synaptic dynamics. We plan to use a very popular, freely available and open source software framework for machine learning (Pytorch). Next, we will establish metrics of network dynamics that help to mechanistically explain what does -- and does not -- matter about cellular and synaptic heterogeneity in impacting learning performance. Finally, we will integrate these tools with a prior cell-type specific computational model of the mouse primary visual cortex, based on large scale Allen Institute databases, to test the hypothesis stated above. Specifically, we will newly determine whether experimentally observed levels of heterogeneity in cellular and synaptic dynamics contribute to the ability of visual microcircuits to perform visual computation. Project Narrative The brain is composed of a large number of cell types, each with diverse dynamical properties that vary robustly from type to type.

"Combined Mechanistic and Input-Output Modeling of the Hippocampus During Spatial Navigation PROJECT ABSTRACT Large-scale realistic model of neuronal network is a powerful tool for studying neural dynamics and cognitive functions. It integrates multi-scale neurobiological mechanisms/processes identified through diverse hypotheses and experimental data into a single platform. However, due to its high complexity and lack of neuron-to-neuron correspondence to experimental data, it is difficult to constrain, validate and optimize such a model using large- scale neural activities recorded from behaving animals, which are most relevant to cognitive processes. We propose to develop a novel modeling paradigm inspired by the generative adversarial network (GAN) to synergistically combine both mechanistic and input-output (machine learning) modeling techniques to build large- scale realistic models that are functionally indistinguishable from actual neuronal networks. We will apply this paradigm to the modeling of the hippocampus to reveal how spatial information is encoded and re-encoded in the hippocampal neuronal networks during navigation. Specifically, full-scale mechanistic model of the hippocampus will be constructed as the generative model to simulate how hippocampal circuits generate ensemble spiking activities in response to 2D trajectories during navigation. Large-scale population-level input- output models will be developed to statistically characterize input-output properties of the real hippocampus and the hippocampal mechanistic model. The input-output models of the mechanistic model will be evaluated by a discriminator against the ground truth input-output models of the real hippocampus. This forms the discriminative model that (1) identifies discrepancies between the mechanistic model and the real hippocampus, and (2) guides the optimization/modification of neuron model and connectivity parameters of the generative model. This procedure will be performed iteratively until the discriminator fails to distinguish the generative (mechanistic) model from the real hippocampus. In addition, the modifications to the mechanistic model generated by this paradigm will provide falsifiable predictions that can be further tested experimentally. We expect to use this combined mechanistic and input-output modeling strategy to unveil how (1) causal relations between spiking activities across different hippocampal subregions, and (2) place fields of hippocampal neurons, are determined by multi-scale neurobiological mechanisms and the interplay between these mechanisms. The proposed methodology will provide a general computational framework for integrating biological knowledge, hypotheses, and large-scale input-output data to gain deeper and more quantitative understanding of cognitive functions.

"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined. This project aims to map these downstream functional circuit components using neuronal translabeling approaches and assess their contribution to precise, robust and flexible motor behavior in Drosophila.",Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking,10201434,F32MH123012,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Anions ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cloning ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Epistasis ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' genetic epistases ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Gait ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nerve ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Play ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Walking ', ' Label ', ' Link ', ' motor disorder ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' Neuropil ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Leg ', ' ARNT ', ' Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator ', ' Dioxin Receptor, Nuclear Translocator ', ' HIF-1 Beta Gene ', ' HIF-1Beta Gene ', ' HIF-1beta ', ' HIF1-Beta Gene ', ' HIF1B ', ' HIF1B Gene ', ' HIF1Beta ', ' HIF1beta Gene ', ' Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Beta Gene ', ' Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, Beta subunit ', ' Nuclear Translocator Gene Dioxin Receptor ', ' TANGO ', ' ARNT gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Motor output ', ' motor control ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,73890,NY-13
"Optoretinography: All-optical measures of functional activity in the human retina Project Summary/Abstract The last few decades have seen major inroads into detailing the physiological mechanisms supporting vision as well as therapies aimed at rescue and repair of neurons affected by retinal diseases. For the continued evolution of treatments and their rapid translation to the clinic, it is essential to find a non-invasive, all-optical biomarker to monitor the efficacy of disease and potential therapeutic agents. To this end, we propose to develop the optoretinogram, or ORG, the optical analog to the electroretinogram (ERG) which is the current gold standard for retinal function assessment in humans. The ORG is rooted in classical interferometry and enables a highly sensitive assay of how neurons interact with light. Using this technique, our group has demonstrated the ability to visualize light-driven neural activity across a range of spatiotemporal resolution – from single cells to a collection of neurons, and from µsecs to ms timescales. Here, we aim to expand the capabilities of the ORG and demonstrate its efficacy for basic science and clinical applications. The proposed technology is built upon a solid foundation of established approaches, and combines them in new and complementary ways to achieve an optimal combination of speed, resolution and sensitivity geared towards overcoming the key challenges faced with imaging cellular structure-function in humans. The core technologies are phase-resolved OCT, an eye-safe, interferometric method to measure nm-scale changes at ms time scales in vivo, adaptive optics (AO) to overcome ocular aberrations, increase the signal-to-noise and allow resolution down to single cells and real-time eye tracking to overcome eye motion and allow targeting, recording and averaging of responses from single and a collection of retinal neurons. These are implemented across three ORG platforms. At the University of Washington, we will refine the line-scan phase-resolved OCT with improvements in optical design and eye-tracking and use it to characterize the basic properties of phototransduction and inner retinal function in healthy human volunteers and patients with retinal degenerations. At Stanford University, we will develop a similar line-scan system for rodents, and together with transgenic models and pharmacology, determine the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the ORG and develop templates for human recordings. At UC Berkeley, we will push the envelope of speed and sensitivity by incorporating a real-time eye-tracking system to drive an AO-OCT interferometric probe, with the aim to measure the tiniest and briefest neuronal changes in the human retina. This bioengineering research partnership will benefit from complementary expertise, research direction and ORG implementation across the three sites, and the use of common approaches for image/data analysis, eye tracking and visual stimulation. Ultimately, the aggregate technology will facilitate a deeper mechanistic understanding of early visual processing and eye disease, and provide entirely new avenues for accelerating therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative This proposal outlines a plan to develop the technology for measuring the Optoretinogram, or ORG: the all- optical recording of functional activity of retinal neurons and their connections in a living eye. We employ a unique combination of technologies (OCT, adaptive optics, interferometry, eye-tracking) that together enable in vivo access to the early visual processing elements in the retina in humans. In the end, we envision powerful, clinically deployable tools suited to test and accelerate the new generation of treatments aimed at regenerating neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,10224662,R01MH113005,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Ablation ', ' functional group ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Property ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' transcriptomics ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' screening ', ' Data Discovery ', ' data resource ', ' in situ sequencing ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' web server ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2021,480000,NY-03
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,10142533,R01MH113250,"['Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brazil ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' India ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Netherlands ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' South Africa ', ' Standardization ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Obsession ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' Inferior ', ' Performance ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Categories ', ' disorder classification ', ' nosology ', ' disease classification ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ', ' International Classification of Diseases ', ' response ', ' disease duration ', ' disease length ', ' illness length ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' Prevalence ', ' brain behavior ', ' reward processing ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' motor control ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' compulsion ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' Structural defect ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' cognitive task ', ' treatment choice ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,843511,NY-13
"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers

"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",10087966,R01MH119421,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endoscopes ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Virus ', ' Halorhodopsins ', ' Halorhodopsin Chromoprotein ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH Technic ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH assay ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Address ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' optogenetics ', ' fear memory ', ' memory consolidation ', ' graph theory ', ' in vivo calcium imaging ', ' In vivo two-photon calcium imaging ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2021,337780,
"Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit Project Summary/Abstract Predicting the consequences of action is a vital function of the nervous system. The hypothesized neural substrate are so-called internal models that transform information about outgoing motor commands and the current sensory state into predictions of sensory input. Such internal models are likely critical for a wide range of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions and their disruption has been implicated in neurological disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Nevertheless, it has proven challenging to understand how internal models are implemented in neural circuits in the mammalian brain. Our prior studies were successful in developing a detailed mechanistic understanding of how neurons in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish predict and cancel out the sensory consequences of a simple behavior--the electric organ discharge (EOD) pulse. However, because these studies were performed in immobilized animals, the nature of the predictions studied was limited in scope and complexity. This renewal uses novel methods for neural recording and high-resolution behavior monitoring in freely swimming fish to study the more complex internal models underlying the remarkable active electrolocation abilities of electric fish. Computational modeling approaches will be used both to rigorously define the problem facing the active electrosensory system and to generate and test realistic circuit-level models of how they may be solved. The key components of such models, including synaptic plasticity, recurrent and feedforward connectivity, and biophysical compartmentalization of axonal and dendritic spikes, are common to many neural systems including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and neocortex. Hence insights from these studies are expected to be widely relevant to understanding how internal models are implemented in neural systems. Project Narrative Although the ability of the nervous system to predict sensory input is critical for accurate perceptions, coordinated movements, and normal cognitive function, detailed accounts of the underlying neural circuitry and plasticity are lacking. This proposal addresses this challenge by applying novel experimental approaches and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model system where neural correlates for learned predictions are highly accessible to mechanistic investigation. The detailed circuit-level models we plan to develop will provide a foundation for understanding how disruptions of predictive mechanisms contribute to neurological disorders.",Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit,10206425,R01NS075023,"['Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Electric Fish ', ' Electric Organ ', ' electroplax ', ' fish electric organ ', ' Electrodes ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Fishes ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mormyridae ', ' Elephantfishes ', ' Mormyrids ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Posture ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Swimming ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' base ', ' insight ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Electrostatics ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' lobes ', ' Lobe ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' neural correlate ', ' sensory input ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,538626,NY-13
"Modeling a Neural Circuit for Flexible Control of Innate Behaviors The adaptive control of social behaviors, such as aggression and reproduction, is a critical function of the nervous system. In the past decade, new methods for genetically targeted functional manipulation and imaging of neural activity have proven phenomenally fruitful in identifying neural subpopulations that play a role in expression of social behaviors. But our understanding of how these neural populations work together in a behaving animal remains highly fractured. In the proposed work, we develop a computational approach to integrate neural imaging data from multiple genetically targeted neural populations and construct a circuit model of social behavior control. A significant challenge in studying social behavior is its high variability and complexity, features that defy traditional trial-averaging-based analyses of neural activity. To address this challenge, we will leverage our recently developed automated tracking system to build a quantitative and detailed model of social behaviors and sensory processing in pairs of freely interacting mice. This behavior model will provide the basis for a thorough statistical analysis of neural dynamics within and between a collection of four subcortical nuclei, which together span three putative layers of processing, the first just past the sensory periphery and the last just upstream of premotor populations in the periaqueductal gray. This analysis will include 1) predicting animals' future behavior from joint neural and behavioral models, 2) characterizing behavior tuning of individual neurons in each nucleus with a linear-nonlinear model, and 3) fitting a network model to imaging data from multiple nuclei, and testing predicted connectivity from this model with a novel optogenetic perturbation system. Finally, we will build on these analyses to address the flexibility of behavior control by network models of subcortical nuclei. In the K99 phase, this research plan will allow me to develop advanced skills in the use of deep learning and recurrent neural networks for data analysis: skills that will be increasingly important as more labs start to study complex behaviors and meso-scale neural circuits. The strong computational environment at Caltech, including the labs of Pietro Perona, Markus Meister, and Doris Tsao, makes it an ideal place to develop my technical training, while the strength of the Anderson lab's experimental program provides a unique chance to collaborate closely with experimentalists in testing and refining models. Additional training in data presentation, teaching, grant-writing, and student mentorship will allow me to transition to an independent position. In the independent R00 phase, I will use these skills and the objectives of my remaining Aims to build a laboratory focused on the study of flexibility and behavioral adaptability in meso-scale neural circuits. Project Narrative This project investigates the network of densely interconnected brain areas that regulate complex social behavior in mammals. A tremendous number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, impair or alter patients' social interactions and motivations. In this proposal, I use theory and modeling to bridge the gap from micro-level understanding of local brain activity to a meso-scale model of how brain areas act in concert to shape behavior, providing a tool to better understand mechanisms that disrupt their collective function.",Modeling a Neural Circuit for Flexible Control of Innate Behaviors,10269964,R00MH117264,"['Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Animal Housing ', ' Hunger ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Instinct ', ' Innate Behavior ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Manuals ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Preoptic Areas ', ' preoptic region ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social position ', ' social standing ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neglect ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' network models ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' generalized anxiety ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' data complexity ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R00,2021,244320,IL-07
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,10247567,U19NS104648,"['Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' instrumentation ', ' Maps ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' reconstruction ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' network models ', ' information processing ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive ability ', ' Data Science ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' social computing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Atlases ', ' Automation ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Bipolar Depression ', ' bipolar depressed ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2021,3062362,NJ-12
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation.

"Diversity supplement to Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data Project Summary Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non- stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. Of particular interest is the description of interactions among two or more brain areas. This application is for an administrative supplement to support an under-represented minority PhD student for two years. As documented by, among others, the National Science Foundation, people of African ancestry are severely under-represented in the sciences. The training provided to the candidate, under this supplement, would serve to elevate the candidate's research profile, and would ultimately contribute to enhancing diversity in the STEM workforce. The candidate's research concerns methods for identifying the flow of information from one brain area to another based on neural spike trains. Two major complications are, first, the noisiness of spike trains as conveyors of information and, second, the large numbers of neurons that must be considered simultaneously. Statistical methods developed very recently, through research supported by this grant, suggest very promising approaches to reducing the effects of noise and grappling with large networks of neurons. Based on these ideas, the candidate will develop a PhD thesis topic, and pursue it, with support from this supplement. Description of R01 and Candidate's Project Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, new recording and stimulation technologies have the potential to greatly accelerate mental health research, thereby improving dramatically the treatments offered to patients. Still, although there have been many important advances in mental health research and treatment, in no case is any mental health disorder well understood mechanistically. Faced with the reality that each promising discovery inevitably reveals new subtleties, a reasonable experimental goal is to be able to change behavior in desirable ways by modifying speciﬁc brain circuits [5, 8] and, in animals, technologies exist for circuit disruptions that are precise in both space and time [4, 7]. However, determining the best location and time for such disruptions to occur, with minimal off-target effects, requires far greater knowledge of circuits than currently exist: we need good characterizations of interactions among brain areas, including their timing relative to behavior. The over- arching aim of our research is to provide statistical methods for describing the ﬂow of information, based on evolving neural activity, among multiple areas of the brain during behavioral tasks. Neurophysiologists are starting to apply methods that can lead to breakthroughs, but the resulting data are complicated, and carefully-crafted statistical methods are needed. The research conducted under this grant over the past 18 years has helped lay the foundation for major advances through steady, systematic investigation of variability in neural signals and construction of new techniques. Our approach applies the knowledge accumulated in the discipline of statistics to the special circumstances of neurophysiology. The primary way neurons communicate is through rapid electrical discharges known as spikes, and se- quences of spikes are known as spike trains. A major focus of attention is the rate at which a neuron is ﬁring, and the way that rate varies with experimental conditions and behaviors. We and others have been trying to understand better the ﬁring rate ﬂuctuations among spike trains recorded simultaneously from many neurons, across multiple regions of the brain. Because each spike occurs over the course of roughly 1 mil- lisecond while behavior occurs over hundreds of milliseconds, it is reasonable to consider a spike train to be a stochastic sequence of isolated points in time which, in probability and statistics, is called a point process. Early theoretical research on point processes relied on an assumption of steady-state time-invariance, known as stationarity. Every behavioral setting, however, creates constantly-evolving neural activity. The origin of this grant in 2001 was our outline of a simple and tractable approach to neural spike train analysis that accommodates evolving, non-stationary activity. It has become a standard tool, and much of our research is based on similar point process statistical models except now, to describe complicated settings, they are much more elaborate. We also analyze and study local ﬁeld potentials (LFPs), which result from all the neural currents gener- ated near the electrode (roughly within 150-200 microns), involving large numbers of neurons [3, 6]. The response of an LFP to varying conditions is less discriminative than individual neurons, but its power (vari- ability) can reveal situations in which a neural population is active, and it has been shown to correlate substantially with the BOLD fMRI signal [11, 12]. LFPs are especially useful for studying the role of oscillating neural circuits. Oscillations appear during many cognitive tasks, and changes in power and os- cillatory coupling have been associated with cognitive impairment [2, 10, 14]. Some of our research has been investigating the sources of LFPs in the cerebral cortex which, using biophysically-informed models, can be inferred to originate in particular cortical layers, thereby supplying important additional detail about dynamics and function [1, 9, 13]. Our Speciﬁc Aim 1 concerns (a) a new, putatively more accurate method of attributing LFPs to cortical sources, which allows us to explore cross-area interactions in greater detail than previously possible, (b) 1 simultaneous analysis of large numbers of LFPs, including those coming from two or more brain areas, and (c) identiﬁcation of oscillatory interactions from multiple brain areas. Speciﬁc Aim 2 concerns (a) simulta- neous analysis of large numbers of spiking neurons, (b) identiﬁcation of cross-correlation among brain areas based on large numbers of spiking neurons within each area, and (c) methods for analysis of precisely-timed synchronous (or nearly synchronous) spiking events, possibly in conjunction with oscillatory signals that are apparent in LFPs. Speciﬁc Aim 3 concerns (a) the combined assessment of interactions that occur at multiple timescales, (b) methods for relating large numbers of LFPs, which evolve across time, to behavior, and (c) creation of a simulation system based on realistic ground-truth models to test our methods. The candidate to be supported by the requested supplement, Tolani Olarinre, is now starting his third year in the joint Machine Learning and Statistics PhD program. We anticipate his ﬁnishing in 3 years, i.e., August 2024. Olarinre's research falls under our Speciﬁc Aim 2 (parts 2A and 2B), which concerns coordinated activity of spiking neurons across brain regions. When information appears to ﬂow from one brain region to another, the time lag may be short, under 10 milliseconds. One way to track ﬂow of information is to look for trial- to-trial variations, and see whether they tend to be consistent across regions. There are simple ways to try to do this, but it turns out they don't work: individual neural spike trains behave much like the simplest point processes, Poisson processes (they are different, but similar), with the consequence that the precise spike timing is unpredictable and, as a result, spike trains provide very noisy representations of evolving neural ﬁring rates. One important component of our research has been to devise methods for reducing the effects of this Poisson-like noise. For example, if two brain regions are coordinated, when activity in one region occurs earlier than average, activity in the other region should tend to occur earlier than average. Olarinre has been working with another graduate student and, based on their work, we have documented the failure of simple methods for identifying this kind of information ﬂow. On the other hand, sophisticated statistical methods succeed in ﬁnding it. We expect to submit a manuscript for publication within the next few months. A major complexity involves the large numbers of neurons recorded within a region, and the possible in- teractions they may have among themselves. A now-standard way to identify such interactions, based on point process statistical modeling, is to put into the model “coupling” terms to measure the inﬂuence of one neuron on another. A former student, Neil Spencer, who recently defended his PhD under Kass's super- vision, has developed very interesting computationally-efﬁcient methods for examining these interactions using network models. We have realized, however, that models with standard coupling terms suffer from the curse of Poisson-like noise. Thus, to be maximally effective they need to be modiﬁed. In outline we know what modiﬁcations to make, but devising a good algorithm and implementation will be challenging. This is a main part of the project Olarinre will next take up and, because novel method and implementation development of this kind requires a lot of time, it will most likely take him through 2022, so that during the Spring semester of 2023 he will be able to propose a thesis topic that includes network models and applies them to key problems. Spencer has acquired world-level expertise in cutting-edge Bayesian computation and he has agreed to collaborate with Olarinre by suggesting approaches, and modiﬁcations when the need arises, which will be very helpful. A letter from Dr. Spencer is provided with this application. In Olarinre's detailed work to date, he has found a wide diversity of neural responses within small regions of cortex. One of the problems he plans to investigate is the role of distinguishable subclasses of neurons. This would require, ﬁrst, methods of deﬁning these subclasses based on physiology (spiking patters), with consideration of anatomical location (cortical layer). Other key problems are to describe the role of thalamic 2 input, and the variability of network behavior across animals. The latter problem will require development of additional new, computationally-intensive methods. The methods Tolani develops should provide new insights into brain network activity. His thesis will likely include contributions to all of these problems, and will thereby yield far more speciﬁc descriptions than currently exist of the way neurons in a particular brain region interact in order to ”package” the information that gets communicated. Mentoring Experience of PI The PI, Kass, has extensive experience mentoring trainees. Within the Department of Statistics he served as graduate advisor before becoming Department Head, a position he held for 9 years. He was involved in a series of 4 NSF training grants (and was PI on 3), across 17 years, all of which had mentoring as a major component. In those capacities he created, supervised, and participated in both group and individual mentoring programs. Kass subsequently served for 3 years as Interim Head of the department-like structure now called the Neuroscience Institute at Carnegie Mellon (CMU), and was concurrently the interim CMU- side Co-Director of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is an umbrella organization run jointly by CMU and the University of Pittsburgh. In that role he supervised graduate training in the very large non-degree program (just under 150 students enrolled, steady-state), which supplements disciplinary PhD training as a certiﬁcated add-on. During Kass's time as Department Head in Statistics he visited Morehouse College in an attempt to ﬁnd ways Carnegie Mellon could be helpful in supplementing the training of students from HBCUs. Out of that came a very successful summer program in basic statistics for those students interested in public health. From 2001 to 2007 we trained 33 students from 19 institutions. Many have gone on to very successful careers including advanced degrees, and we would like to think they were served well by being able to analyze and interpret data with conﬁdence (one became President of the Eastern North America branch of the Biometric Society). Kass has also been PI of an NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research training grant in computational neuro- science, which is now commencing its 15th year. Our version of the NIH Blueprint training in computational neuroscience has had an important additional component, a 10-week summer program for undergraduates, typically rising seniors. The program is not aimed primarily at URMs, but we have tried to recruit them during a selective admissions process. Over the past 8 years we trained 18 URM students (just under 25% of the total). The training begins with 2 weeks of background lectures together with supervised computational labs, and this is followed by 8 weeks of research as a member of a faculty lab group. Our goal has been to give these students the kind of exciting and productive research experience that would encourage them to apply to graduate school in areas related to computational neuroscience, while also getting them better pre- pared to do so. The program has been run by a faculty member devoted to this project (for summer support); Kass has served not only as the PI of the program but also as an active participant, delivering lectures and supervising 1 or 2 undergraduate trainees himself each summer. Training and Career Development Plan Primary Mentoring Having gotten to know Olarinre over these past 2.5 years, Kass is aware of his unusual strengths and also the challenges he faces. Olarinre now has good training in graduate level statistics and machine learning. He also has an unusually strong background in software engineering (having worked at Intel for 5 years). There are, however, occasional holes in his background, and his progress is somewhat slower than many other students here (Carnegie Mellon attracts its share of the very top students in statistics and machine learning internationally). As a consequence, in addition to weekly group meetings that Kass 3 and Olarinre will attend, (i) Kass will meet with Olarinre, individually, at least once a week, and sometimes more often, (ii) Kass's review of Olarinre's progress will be continual (i.e., at least weekly), (iii) Kass will not assume Olarinre has absorbed aspects of research and professional development unless they have been assessed, and (iv) Kass and Olarinre will have frequent discussions about future publication plans, presentation plans, and PhD program milestone plans; from time to time they will also talk about career goals, and strategies for achieving them. Research Methods As we said, Olarinre's courses have provided him the foundational theory and meth- ods for statistical machine learning (he will be ﬁnished with coursework at the end of this semester). Be- coming an effective researcher in this area requires, in addition, (a) detailed understanding of results from the neuroscience literature, and their experimental contexts; ( b) appreciation of aspects of data collection, including pre-processing steps, that might affect analysis and conclusions; (c) strong cross-disciplinary com- munication skills; (d) an ability to collaborate with other analysts, ranging from postdoctoral researchers to undergraduates; (e) the knowledge and willingness to “break” statistical models in order to evaluate their applicability to the problem at hand; (f) a clear appreciation of what statistical models can and can not accomplish; and (g) the ability to envision a uniﬁed analytical evaluation built from many different compo- nents, and to develop a convincing explanatory description of the work. These elements of research methods provide a checklist for Kass in assessing Olarinre's progress. Assessment comes from probing discussions during individual meetings, as well as the written summaries of work that Kass will require before each weekly meeting (described below). Instruction for Olarinre will come from feedback, but will be reinforced by general comments—not directed at speciﬁc individuals—in group meetings. In addition, component skills in research methods are apparent in oral presentations, writing for publication, and writing to meet the requirements of PhD program milestones. Individual meetings with Kass Olarinre will present his work in a structured form. Prior to each meeting, Olarinre will send to Kass a short document that contains key ﬁgures and equations, together with very concise explanations and conclusions; it will also include any concerns and queries he might have, and his thoughts on next steps, mainly for the following week. All points of summary and interpretation will have to be presented as whole-sentence bullet points, and all ﬁgures must have detailed captions to make them largely self-contained. Kass has found the whole-sentence bullet points, especially, to be an extremely useful device for trainees: it forces them to articulate a series of ideas that express, conceptually, their key ﬁndings and observations. This special format has challenged Olarinre, as it does many students—it's easy to avoid following the format when rushed, but the beneﬁts are improved communication, together with development of a skill that will serve him well for future oral and written presentations. By including next steps, in writing, he will habituate his planning process. As he reviews the previous week's plans together with their current week's results, Olarinre will gain conﬁdence in his progress. Furthermore, such documents can grow relatively easily into manuscripts. Kass emphasizes the importance of writing, and will guide Olarinre toward clarifying the structure and style of his written work, in conjunction with improving its substance. Mentoring topics and timeline In addition to the speciﬁcs of research, and its presentation, the mentoring that Kass will provide to Olarinre will include multiple topics. We have structured these again in a kind of check-list format (like the multiple aspects of research methods) and, in addition, have laid out a detailed timeline for them, in tabular form. The topics are explained brieﬂy, following the table itself. 4  21 Su 21 F 22 S 22 Su 22 F 23 S 23 Su 23 F 24 S 24 Su Milestones X X X Publications X X X X  Meetings X X X X  Teaching X X  Writing Skills X X X X X X  Presentation Skills X X X X X X X X X X Grant Writing X X  Reviewing X X  Time Management X X X X  Ethics X X X  Jobs X X X  Meet with Brown X X  Program milestones: These include ﬁnishing, presenting, and writing up an Advanced Data Analysis project in Fall 2021, the thesis proposal, in the summer of 2023; and the thesis defense in the summer of 2024. The Advanced Data Analysis project must involve a major cross-disciplinary effort (at least 12 months) and Olarinre must have an external co-advisor in addition to Kass. Olarinre's research has been done in collaboration with Dr. Joshua Siegle at the Allen Brain Institute. Dr. Siegle provided a letter of collaboration for the most recent grant application submission, and he will serve as formal co-advisor. Pub- lications: We anticipate 3 publications from the thesis, with the ﬁrst being based on the Advanced Data Analysis project; initial work on the ﬁrst paper will begin by the end of this summer, after which Olarinre will focus entirely on ﬁnishing the research and presenting it, with the paper being completed and submitted during Spring 2022. Work on the second paper will occur in conjunction with the thesis proposal in Spring 2023, while the third paper will be written in time for its incorporation into the thesis itself, in Spring 2024. Meetings: Olarinre will attend and present results at multiple meetings, including the 2022 international meeting on Statistical Analysis of Neural Data (SAND10), the 2023 meeting on computational and systems neuroscience (COSYNE), and the 2023 Joint Statistical Meeting. This latter is the largest statistical meeting in the world, and one of the best opportunities for networking. At all of these meetings Kass will make sure Olarinre is “plugged in,” by introducing him to researchers at different levels of seniority who share his interests. In 2024 Olarinre will attend at least one additional meeting, possibly the annual meeting of the biometric society (ENAR) during the Spring. Teaching: Large undergraduate enrollments at institutions like CMU have made teaching assistants essential to delivery of most courses offered by departments like Statistics & Data Science. Since our ﬁrst NSF training grant in 1996, Kass has recognized a much broader importance of TAing and related experiences to the development of graduate students in statistics. One of the pillars in our understanding is the recognition that much the same skills are used when teaching as when communicating technical material to less technical collaborators. Thus, regardless of Olarinre's ultimate career path, he will be served well by understanding what makes teachers effective, and by guided practice. Olarinre will serve as TA during Fall 2022 and Fall 2023. (While he is TAing, Olarinre will not be supported by this supplement.) Because he is in the joint PhD program with Machine Learning, he is expected to serve as a TA for one of their courses and one of the courses offered by Statistics & Data Science. We are very fortunate to have here at CMU a leading center for teaching, the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence, the director of which, who holds a PhD in cognitive psychology, Kass collaborated with extensively early in her career. The center is a national leader in the formulation of good practices for undergraduate teaching and is unusual in its explicit use, in its many programs and materials, of high-quality research in educational psychology. The Eberly Center offers a series of workshops for graduate students, which Olarinre will at- 5 tend. Writing Skills: In addition to what we have already said, the timeline indicates when attention will be focused on document production. Presentation Skills: This is continual, through group presentations. Kass will review slides and provide feedback during practice sessions for all milestones and professional meeting presentations. Grant writing: Kass will go over with the NeuroStats group the process of grant writing, and with Olarinre individually as preparation for his thesis proposal and for his postdoctoral job search. On these occasions Olarinre will produce a short mock grant proposal, including speciﬁc aims, that Kass and others will critique. Reviewing: Kass is frequently asked to review articles for publication in leading journals and almost always asks a trainee to serve as a co-reviewer. Olarinre will get the chance to review such articles on at least two occasions, planned for summer of 2022 and 2023, as those are times with minimal additional responsibilities for him. Kass will guide him through the process. This is also a general topic that comes up in our NeuroStats research group, so discussions there (with several faculty) will reinforce best practices. Time management: Kass will review with Olarinre his strategies and tactics for time management, especially when key deadlines are looming. Ethics: Kass will discuss ethical issues with Olarinre as they arise naturally during the interdisciplinary collaboration and publication process. In addition, formal sessions will occur in the NeuroStats group. Topics Kass plans to discuss, and has discussed with other groups previously, include individual responsibilities when working together as a team across se- niority levels; determining authorship; plagiarism and acknowledgment of previous work; responsibility to publish; redundancy or duplication of publications; integrity in reporting statistical results; careful attention to statistical assumptions; making data and code available; intellectual property involving novel methodol- ogy; accuracy, acknowledgment of previous results, and responsibility to educate during oral presentations; conﬁdentiality and impartiality in reviewing the work of others; honest representation of work, accuracy of budgets, and responsible use of funds in grant proposals; types of scientiﬁc misconduct; complexity of typ- ical scenarios; responsibility and appropriate channels for reporting. Sessions are planned for each Spring, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Job hunting: Kass will ask several former trainees to discuss with the NeuroStats group their experiences, including types of jobs, interview preparation, honest representation of self, and the problem of assessing the multiple trade-offs among alternatives. These sessions are planned for each Fall, 2021, 2022, 2023. Kass will of course also discuss all of these topics with Olarinre when it is time for him to begin his search for his next position, presumably as a postdoctoral fellow. Additional Mentoring by Dr. Emery Brown Olarinre will be mentored primarily by Kass, with some supplementary mentoring by Dr. Emery Brown, at MIT. Brown has had a long-term collaboration with Kass (they wrote two highly-cited review papers on statistics in neurophysiology as well as an inﬂuential paper on graduate training in statistics). Brown is unusually accomplished: he is an MD-PhD, the only person to hold endowed chairs at both MIT and Harvard Medical School, a member of all 3 National Academies, and he is the 2020 winner of the Swartz Prize in Computational Neuroscience from the Society for Neu- roscience. Brown is deeply interested in the research topics Olarinre is pursuing and he is also himself an unusually successful mentor, including of trainees from under-represented groups. Dr. Brown, who is African-American, has also been very involved in diversity efforts at MIT and Harvard Medical School. The additional wisdom and advice Dr. Brown can offer Olarinre will be invaluable. A letter of collaboration for this special purpose is supplied with our application. Speciﬁcally, Brown has agreed to listen to Olarinre give a formal presentation, give him feedback, and discuss with him his goals and progress toward them. This will occur in Spring 2022, before Olarinre gives his ﬁrst presentation at the SAND10 meeting, and again in Summer 2023 in preparation for Olarinre's attendance and presentation at the Joint Statistical Meeting. At that time Brown will also talk to Olarinre about job search, which will be commencing. 6",Diversity supplement to Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10378845,R01MH064537,"['Academy ', '

"Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness SUMMARY The standard view of how we make sense of the world around us focuses on reconstructing our environment from the information received by our sensory organs. In this view, low-level brain areas (e.g., primary sensory cortex) represent basic features of objects, which are elaborated on in successive processing stages, until representations become increasingly complex in high-level areas (e.g., frontal cortex). An alternative view is predictive coding (PC), in which we model our environment to generate sensory predictions. In PC, high-level brain areas generate predictions of sensory activity and transmit them to low-level areas. A prediction that does not match the sensory information gives rise to a prediction error. This error signal is sent from low- to high-level brain areas to update the model of our environment, thereby improving future predictions to minimize errors. Modeling studies show PC is a fast and efficient way to process sensory information, and PC provides innovative hypotheses for understanding sleep and anesthesia, particularly when disconnected consciousness occurs (consciousness without awareness of the environment), like dreaming. PC also holds great promise for conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. But key central features of PC have not been empirically tested and little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. The goal of the proposed project is to characterize the neural dynamics, circuits and receptors enabling PC. There are two principle hypotheses. First, predictions depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) because NMDAR influence the activity of high-level brain areas where predictions are generated, and NMDAR are enriched on neurons in lower-level areas receiving predictions. Second, in disconnected consciousness, a breakdown of information transmission from low-level to high-level brain areas, as well as a breakdown of computations within each area, explains why models of our environment are not updated by external sensory information. These breakdowns prevent the comparison of predictions and sensory information, as well as the transmission of prediction errors to high-level brain areas. To test these hypotheses, we use a cross-species experimental design connecting cellular, circuit and systems levels to behavior. We will perform electroencephalography, machine learning and computational modeling to define the neural basis of PC in humans performing prediction tasks. Then we will manipulate PC using different anesthetic agents with diverse mechanisms, establishing causal relationships between receptors, large-scale brain networks and PC. In parallel, we will simultaneously record activity from sensory and high-level brain areas of non-human primates (NHPs) using the same PC tasks and pharmacological interventions to measure cellular and circuit level contributions to PC. Investigating PC will illuminate the fundamental mechanisms of perception, providing critical insights to guide therapeutic development for multiple health conditions. NARRATIVE This research advances our understanding of how the brain generates predictions which shape how we perceive the world, otherwise known as predictive coding. Predictive coding is relevant to public health because it holds great promise in conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, delirium and dementia, as well as understanding sleep and anesthesia. Progress in understanding the basic mechanisms of predictive coding, as well as predictive coding deficits, is a necessary step in developing more effective treatment strategies for multiple health conditions.","Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness",10216373,R01NS117901,"['Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cues ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Ketamine ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Study models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Propofol ', ' Diprivan ', ' Disoprofol ', ' Public Health ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Adrenergic Receptor ', ' Adrenoceptors ', ' Epinephrine Receptors ', ' adenoreceptor ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' sedative ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic Nuclei ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Measures ', ' N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors ', ' N-Methylaspartate Receptors ', ' NMDA Receptor-Ionophore Complex ', ' NMDA Receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Dexmedetomidine ', ' Pulvinar structure ', ' Pulvinar ', ' pulvinar thalami ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Agonist ', ' Shapes ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' paired stimuli ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Disinhibition ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' postsynaptic ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' neural correlate ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,458246,WI-02
