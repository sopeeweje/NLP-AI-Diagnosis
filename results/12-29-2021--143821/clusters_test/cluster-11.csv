"Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. While a number of evidence- based therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with HF, nearly half of these patients are not regularly taking their medications. Although medication adherence can be improved through timely interventions, it is challenging for clinicians to accurately identify and predict medication non-adherence at the point of care. The challenge persists partly because medication adherence is a complex process influenced by an interplay of a multitude of patient-, provider-, system-, community-, and therapy-related factors. This gap in identifying patients at risk of non-adherence can be addressed through increasing availability of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs), which affords the potential to make accurate, real time predictions of adherence in HF. In particular, recent linkages of EHR and pharmacy data has created opportunity for incorporation of prior medication fills into EHR-based adherence prediction models that are updated continuously. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with such data allows for incorporation of a large number of intercorrelated risk factors and their interactions into models and for accommodating continuous updates as new information becomes available. Our objective is to build a ML-based algorithm to predict adherence among patients with HF. The specific aims are: 1) to develop supervised ML algorithms to predict medication adherence among HF patients, using EHR clinical data, linked pharmacy fill data, and location- based social determinants data from a large, urban health system that cares for a diverse patient population; 2) to assess fairness of the developed algorithms by evaluating cross-validated prediction and calibration on patient subgroups based on social and economic factors, to ensure that the desirable prediction performance is maintained for the diverse groups; and 3) to assess generalizability of the algorithms through validation in a second large, urban health system caring for a diverse population. Our approach is innovative and novel in several ways. First, we will take advantage of linkages between pharmacy fill information and the EHR to incorporate pharmacy data in our models. Second, we utilize geocoding of patient addresses combined with publicly available data to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants of health, which are among the most important predictors of adherence, into our models. Third, we will assess fairness of the model by evaluating the predictive performance and calibration on patients from diverse backgrounds. Fourth, we will ensure generalizability of the prediction algorithm by developing it in one diverse health system and validating the algorithm in a second diverse health system. These models will be developed such that they can be used for point-of-care adherence prediction. Our long term goal is to be able to implement them into the EHR, at which point they can be incorporated into interventions to address medication adherence and, ultimately, improve both adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with HF. Project Narrative Poor medication adherence in heart failure can lead to poor health, but many clinicians are unable to determine who would benefit from interventions to address adherence. We will build machine learning models to identify patients at risk of not taking their medicines using an approach that minimizes potential biases. Electronic health record data will be used in these models, allowing them to be incorporated into interventions to improve medication adherence and reduce the disease burden of heart failure.",Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure,10095553,R01HL155149,"['Algorithms ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Performance ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' social health determinants ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' medication nonadherence ', ' medication non-adherence ', ' social factors ', ' social determinants ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' algorithm development ', ' ']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,763554,NY-12
"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions. This study proposes the development and application of multi- modal health information technology innovations – such as machine learning-based predictive modeling, massive electronic datasets, wearable devices, and flexible sensor electronics – to enhance understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology and identify new potential therapeutic strategies.",Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma,10260459,DP5OD029610,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Eyedrops ', ' Eye Drops ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Improving the accessibility and relevance of Medical Nutritional Therapy among people with Type 2 diabetes in the Latino community through a customizable, AI-powered application. PROJECT SUMMARY Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) is an effective treatment for managing Type 2 diabetes (T2D), but studies have shown that few T2D patients adhere to or access it. This low utilization rate can be attributed to the small number of registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) compared to the number of patients with T2D, limited reimbursement pathways for MNT, and resource constraints in the patient population. These issues are exacerbated in the Latino community due to limited access to care, economic disparities, and few resources tailored to culture identity. Currently, incorporating cultural relevance into an MNT plan must be done manually by an RDN. Existing digital applications focus on meal tracking or discrete biological factors (e.g. gut microbiome), supplementing healthy lifestyles rather than supporting MNT delivery and failing to address personal and cultural factors in meal plan creation and adherence. YumAI is a novel AI-based application that delivers and tracks adherence to MNT-compliant recipes that are customized to factors such as budget, family, location, season, food preferences, and preparation complexity. By automating meal plan adjustment, YumAI brings customized, high-quality MNT directly to patients through an easy-to-use digital application available on desktop computers and personal devices. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will further develop this AI-powered application, incorporating feedback from preliminary testing, ensuring compliance with ADA dietary guidelines and MNT stipulations, and optimizing the software specifically for individuals with T2D of Mexican decent. We will conduct two design thinking workshops to identify product features and discover factors in recipe customization and MNT compliance. Through an iterative design process, we will develop a proof of concept of YumAI and demonstrate algorithmic capabilities that enable basic recipe plan customization. Our two-step approach balances compliance with MNT standards and builds in relevant factors to customize recipe recommendations to user needs. Recognizing the complexity of plan customization and the number of possible dimensions of adherence, the purpose of the research is to demonstrate technical feasibility of a solution that can be enhanced in future development and to identify gaps in data collection. Successful completion of this project will result in a functional prototype of YumAI, the first digital health mechanism for increasing access to MNT for the Mexican population with T2D. This project will provide proof of concept and feasibility for future studies to scale YumAI for a broader population. It will prepare us for a Phase II project that explores in situ interaction with the product and efficacy of the product in solving issues of and patient adherence, cultural awareness, and RDN scalability. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT), a holistic component of a Type 2 diabetes (T2D) management plan provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), is shown to improve HbA1c, delay complications of T2D, and lead to significant cost savings compared to other T2D WUeaWPeQW PeWhRdV.

"Novel methods and devices to deliver substitution therapy in addiction PROJECT SUMMARY Current treatment options for addiction do not sufficiently address the clinical needs of patients. Due to low efficacy, misaligned treatment objectives, or lack of accessibility, patients are not able to durably abstain from substances or reduce their use to safer levels. Substitution therapy (ST) is a proven treatment approach and has resulted in massive global public health benefits for tobacco use disorder and opioid use disorder; however, the potential impact of ST is limited by concerns for causing more widespread harms. Thus substitution therapy is either underutilized or underexplored in other addictions due to risks of abuse, misuse, and diversion. Through implementing safe prescribing systems, health systems have solved for the provision of existing ST like methadone and buprenorphine. Nevertheless, there remains significant potential for broader access to current and novel ST treatments by utilizing advancement in software and hardware technology. Atman Therapeutics is an early-stage company seeking to develop novel therapeutics in addictive disorders. We are developing a platform to enable increased access to as well as novel development of ST. To achieve this objective, our platform uses cutting-edge machine learning methods, patient-centered research, and sophisticated hardware technology. Our technology will also enable the concurrent delivery of contingency management services, thus creating safe, engaging, and durably effective treatments for these complex neurobehavioral disorders. This Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) project aims to establish the feasibility of machine learning and integrated sensor technologies to confirm medication adherence in a diverse sample of patients. We will develop a deep-learning algorithm utilizing a feed-forward convolutional neural network (CNN), such as ResNet- 50, U-NET, PCU-Net, to enact classification of medication ingestion events. We will also demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a hardware microcontroller unit with multi-dimensional MEMS sensors into a device that can classify ingestion events in a highly sensitive and specific manner. These efforts will demonstrate the early feasibility of the Atman platform and form the basis for regulated development efforts of ST-enabling products and services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal aims to develop automated methods to confirm ingestion of medication, as this is a critical step to ensure medication compliance. In this proof-of-concept study, we will demonstrate the feasibility of automated ingestion confirmation and integrate hardware components capable of accurately confirming ingestion to enable a novel

"iGLAMOUR Study:  Innovations in Glaucoma Adherence and monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma affects more than 70 million people worldwide and is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness. The only current method to delay its development and progression is by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), achieved with topical administration of eyedrops. Adherence rates for glaucoma eyedrop administration are poor, in many cases below 50%, resulting in disease progression, eventual blindness, and a more than 2-fold increase in healthcare costs. African Americans and Latinos carry a significantly higher glaucoma burden compared with Caucasians. Minorities have additionally been found to have disproportionately lower rates of medication adherence. Previously studied interventions aimed at improving glaucoma adherence had key limitations that particularly affect minorities, including unreliable self-reported measures of adherence, lack of consideration of individual circumstances influencing glaucoma medication management, and developing/testing interventions in predominantly Caucasian populations. Health information technology has experienced rapid advancement in the last decade with the electronic health record (EHR), the proliferation of accessory mobile health technologies, and the advancement of artificial intelligence. Although their integration holds great promise to enable screening tools for diagnosis and risk prediction, successful integration to aid minority populations in real-world settings depends on: understanding how the collected information relates to the patient's other (e.g. clinical) data and the patient's socio-cultural context; seamless information exchange and interoperability with the EHR, the central portal of healthcare delivery; and integration of algorithmic findings into workflows involving both providers and patients to deliver information and/or recommendations in a simple, actionable manner. Glaucoma is a complex chronic disease, spanning decades of patients' lives and requiring ongoing monitoring and evaluation, thus making it an ideal application for the use of health IT to reduce racial disparities. In this proposal, we aim to accomplish this by: demonstrating the effectiveness of a flexible electronic eyedrop sensor to generate granular digital signatures of an individual's adherence and contextualizing this data in a socio- cultural context with patient interviews (Aim 1), combining adherence data with EHR variables to construct machine learning models to predict IOP control and enhance clinical risk stratification (Aim 2), and prototyping a dynamic dashboard for intervention coordination (Aim 3). Altogether, success of this innovative, comprehensive, culturally-tailored, and scalable health IT framework will improve medication adherence and slow disease progression among minorities, therefore narrowing this important racial health disparity. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos carry a disproportionate burden of glaucoma, a blinding eye disease that can lead to severely decreased quality of life. Promoting adherence with topical medications that lower intraocular pressure, the primary therapeutic target for reducing the risk of glaucoma progression, represents a critical opportunity for technology-driven interventions. The iGLAMOUR (innovations in GLaucoma Adherence and Monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities) Study aims to develop and evaluate a health information technology framework incorporating flexible sensor electronics, machine learning-based predictive models, a patient- facing mobile interface, and a clinician-facing clinical dashboard to facilitate early identification and intervention for

"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Attention ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' expectation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Regimen ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' patient portal ', ' anti-cancer ', ' anticancer ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906,TN-05
"Rehabilitation Engagement at Home with a socially Assistive roBot for Pediatric Adherence (REHAB-PAL) Project Summary/Abstract  Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder and cause of disability in children, with a prevalence of roughly half a million children in the United States. Nearly all children with CP undergo physical therapy to improve gait, strength, balance, or flexibility. This therapy depends on dosage far in excess of available clinical session time, making adherence to an at-home therapy regimen critical to success. As therapy may be difficult, repetitive, or just not fun, maintaining engagement, adherence, and exercise relevance and quality in pediatric rehabilitation patients are critical barriers to an effective at-home rehabilitative physical therapy regimen.  To promote engagement and adherence, a solution must be attractive and fun, build rapport with the patient, and promote focus within a session as well as longitudinal motivation. Active video games have proven to be an improvement over typical practice but leave room for innovation; recent research suggests a promising complementary approach based on an artificially intelligent, physically embodied social agent. By activating humans’ natural social responses, socially assistive robots have been shown to enhance engagement and adherence in related settings.  Charles River Analytics and our partners at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital propose a Phase I SBIR to prototype and demonstrate the feasibility of “Rehabilitation Engagement at Home with a socially Assistive roBot for Pediatric Adherence” (REHAB-PAL). REHAB-PAL is a socially assistive robot for children undergoing rehabilitative physical therapy that provides companionship and engagement during therapy. REHAB-PAL improves adherence to the home-care regimen by encouraging the prescribed therapeutic exercises with fun and supportive interaction. To rigorously isolate its effects, we will compare the robot to a behaviorally analogous screen-based virtual agent.  We will prototype and demonstrate REHAB-PAL’s feasibility via three Specific Aims: (1) Design and develop socially assistive application software for a commercially available small humanoid robot and a screen-based virtual agent. (2) Integrate with a visuo-motor integration task. (3) Evaluate clinical suitability of REHAB-PAL for gait and balance training in children with CP.  Ultimately, we aim to show that REHAB-PAL offers patients an engaging and encouraging companion throughout a potentially dreary treatment, while offering clinicians a superior tool to keep pediatric patients motivated and focused on their treatment and a valuable proxy to provide continuity, consistency and monitoring during home care. By enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic dosage outside the clinic, REHAB-PAL has the potential to extend and improve care, with less frequent clinic visits and improved adherence.

"Identifying treatment responders in medication trials for AUD using machine learning approaches ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as defined in DSM-5, represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there remain major opportunities to further elucidate clinical response in completed medication trials. To that end, a key question in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is which patients respond to a given pharmacotherapy. Identifying treatment responders provides major opportunities to advance clinical care for AUD by personalizing medication practices on the bases of variables/predictors of good clinical response. For example, while the effect size for medications such as naltrexone is deemed small-to-moderate, a host of studies over the past decade have shown that its effect size may be considerably larger for certain subgroups of patients. Towards advancing precision medicine for AUD and leveraging data from a host of carefully conducted RCTs for AUD, this R03 application seeks to conduct secondary data analysis. Specifically, we propose to analyze data from four RCTs conducted by the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG). These state-of-the-art RCTs for AUD have tested the following pharmacotherapies: (a) quetiapine, (b) Levetiracetam XR (Keppra XR®), (c) Varenicline (Chantix®), and (d) HORIZANT® (Gabapentin Enacarbil) Extended-Release. In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in the NCIG RCTs. Machine learning represents a highly promising and underutilized data analytic strategy in the field of AUD treatment response. Machine learning models prioritize the ability to predict future outcomes over creating perfectly fitting models for the data at hand. This results in models which are more generalizable to future observations, which fits well with our goal of identifying responders in RCTs. Leveraging data from these pivotal RCTs through secondary data analysis and using novel analytic methods, namely machine learning, provides a cost-effective approach to identifying AUD pharmacotherapy responders.

"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population.

"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,10132378,K01HL141538,"['Affect ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Color ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Review Literature ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' prophylactic ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Palate ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' systematic review ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' implementation research ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' successful intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' clinical decision support ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' side effect ', ' provider behavior ', ' clinician behavior ', ' physician behavior ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,143581,MA-07
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level.

"Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease. The largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. Medication errors result in 3 million outpatient medical appointments, 1 million emergency department visits, and 125,000 hospital admissions each year. Astoundingly, over 4 billion prescriptions are dispensed every year in the United States alone. Although dispensing error rates are generally low at 0.06%, the sheer volume of dispensed medications translates to 2.4 million incorrectly dispensed medications each year. In the pharmacy, dispensing errors arise when pharmacists do not detect that the medication filled inside a prescription vial is different from the medication ordered on the prescription's label. These dispensing errors can result in patient harm, added strain on the healthcare system, and costly legal action against the pharmacy. Machine intelligence (MI) can be employed to assist in the verification process to help avoid dangerous and costly pharmacy dispensing errors.4–6 However for the human-MI partnership to function optimally, the MI should be capable of conveying accurate information that encourages providers to make sound cognitive decisions such that optimal trust is maintained, and temporal and cognitive demand is reduced. Imperative to this goal is to design MI from which interpretable information can be extracted, convey this information in an effective manner and calibrate user's trust in MI as either over-trust or under-trust can lead to near miss and incident errors. This proposed project will further our knowledge for designing interpretable MI outputs and inform the development of MI models that encourage pharmacy staff to make sound clinical decisions that lead to better patient outcomes while improving work-life at lower costs of care. This study develops interpretable MI methods in the context of medication images classification and designs effective MI advice and reasoning that lead to lower cognitive demand and increased trust in the MI. Our hypothesis is that interpretable MI will lead to improved work performance and more calibrated trust compared to uninterpretable M. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease and the largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. These dispensing errors occur approximately 2,400,000 times every year in the United States alone and can result in patient safety issues and add unnecessarily to the already strained healthcare system.The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance.",Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence,10183536,R01LM013624,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medication Errors ', ' medication administration errors ', ' Methods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Vial device ', ' Vial ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Trust ', ' tool ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' medical appointment ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' Modeling ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' job performance ', ' work performance ', ' Performance at work ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' support tools ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' care costs ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,288814,MI-12
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10128442,K08DK119475,"['Algorithms ', ' Aminoglycosides ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Carbapenems ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cephalosporins ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' digestive disorder ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Penicillins ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C. difficile ', ' Clostridioides difficile ', ' Generations ', ' Antiplatelet Drugs ', ' Antiplatelet Agents ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' beta-Lactams ', ' β-Lactams ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Fluoroquinolones ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' usability ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,35124,PA-03
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Black scientists are underrepresented in health-related research fields and women from racial and ethnic minority groups face particular challenges at the graduate level and beyond.

"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia.

"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10223435,R01HL153543,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Methodology ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Location ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Palate ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' high risk ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' patient engagement ', ' participant engagement ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' dietary adherence ', ' diet adherence ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607792,RI-01
"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,10200136,UH3HL144163,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Colorado ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -
