"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels. Project narrative Although sleep has significant potential to impair cognition and impede health, relatively little is known about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This research will begin to close this gap in knowledge through a 400 person randomized trial in Chennai, India, which will objectively and rigorously measure sleep and key environmental factors impacting sleep, evaluate the impact of two simple and scalable interventions to improve sleep, and estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision-making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, tobacco consumption), and earnings. Providing rigorous evidence on these relationships and improving our collective understanding of the causes and costs to sleep deprivation, including not just direct health outcomes, but also shifts in preferences and decision-making directly relevant to health, will provide policy-relevant information important to improving health and healthy behaviors as well as promoting heathy and economically-secure aging.",The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India,10079453,K01AG055691,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Career Mobility ', ' career advancement ', ' career transition ', ' Cognition ', ' Cost Measures ', ' Cost metrics ', ' cost measurement ', ' Decision Making ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economic Models ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' India ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Morbidity -

"Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is responsive to NIH solicitation PA-17-089 for projects involving secondary analysis of pre-existing geriatric datasets. While presently there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, existing literature indicates that early diagnosis in the preclinical stage, i.e., before the onset of clinical symptoms, will be key to treatments. There is a pressing need for noninvasive predictors of cognitive decline that can enable early identification of individuals at Alzheimer’s disease risk. A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that sleep disturbances (including microarchitectural disruptions to non-rapid-eye-motion sleep and decline in sleep quality) might be the earliest observable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. On-the-go sleep and activity monitoring could address the need for noninvasive indicators of cognitive decline in subjects who are in the (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will build on preliminary results that reveal a set of sleep features derived from polysomnography (PSG) that are predictive of cognitive performance. We are proposing to perform secondary analysis of sleep and cognition data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort using state-of-the-art deep learning tools to enable sleep-based prediction of cognitive impairment for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep measurement, it is not well- suited for routine, day-to-day use. In comparison, wrist-based measurements (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate, ECG, and pulse oximetry) obtained from wearable devices allow “on-the-go” sleep monitoring. The combination of these on-the-go measures with the latest artificial intelligence tools is a feasible route to early Alzheimer’s diagnostics. We will use attention-guided long short-term memory autoencoders to identify overt and latent characteristics of the raw time-series datasets, which will allow us to more effectively mine the rich MESA data resource. Our deep learning framework will also take into account sociodemographic variables, indicators of health status, and medications. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the MESA-trained deep learning models will be performed on PSG and actigraphy data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is a longitudinal study designed to further our understanding of what differentiates normal aging from preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To address any concern about the “black-box” nature of deep learning models, we will compare the learned feature set with sleep microarchitectural features previously computed using classical statistical techniques. Previous data suggests that a subject’s apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE4) allele carrier status influences the degree to which their sleep patterns impact their cognitive abilities. We will verify this by incorporating ApoE4 status as an additional input to the deep learning model. Literature shows that over 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease have at least one clinical sleep disorder. The on-the-go prediction paradigm using noninvasive sleep measurements to be validated in this project will have a significant impact on early Alzheimer’s diagnostics and facilitate ongoing clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are a common feature of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease before the onset of symptoms would be critically important for disease management and therapeutics.

"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults. Results will be used to build more predictive health behavior theories and inform personalized behavior interventions to reduce obesity and improve public health.",Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance,10224874,U01HL146327,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep ', ' Specificity ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Voice ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' sedentary ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Physical activity ', ' Failure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' self control ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' lifetime risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' weight gain prevention ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' demographics ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' recruit ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' sleep behavior ', ' sleep habit ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2021,648337,CA-37
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to

"Decoding and Selective Modulation of Human Memory During Awake/Sleep Cycles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Episodic memories integrate the content of human experience in space and time and constitute the core of one's identity. Memory formation involves processing, and constructing interpretations of the incoming information in our daily lives and is one of the first functions compromised in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. With population aging, we face a “Cognitive Tsunami” of millions of people with memory disorders. Thus, understanding neural mechanisms of memory, and finding interventions that enhance these processes is a critical endeavor with the potential to improve the lives of countless people world-wide.  Although it is established that memory is critical for cognitive well-being, and sleep is critical for memory consolidation, the underlying mechanisms in the human brain are poorly understood. Research on memory and sleep so far has suffered from a gap between non-invasive cognitive research in humans and detailed electrophysiological research in animals. Moreover, most human studies are dominated by stimulus response methodologies where the presented stimuli constitute limited, discretized, aspects of memory. This approach, albeit well-controlled, is far from the rich narrative of episodes we experience. Thus, to mechanistically probe human memory consolidation, it is imperative to (a) employ methodologies that incorporate the continuous and multimodal nature of experience; (b) identify relevant neural activation patterns and how they are transformed and reactivated during sleep; (c) establish means to causally modulate memory processes during sleep.  Building upon our exploratory U01 project, this proposal seeks a breakthrough in our understanding by going beyond the state-of-the-art, and via the application of integrative and multidisciplinary approaches. It capitalizes on a highly unique opportunity to record and modulate neuronal activity of a large number of single neurons and neuronal assemblies in the human brain. In parallel, it exploits the high dimensionality of the data as an asset through the use of cutting-edge Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, which have emerged as promising analysis tools. Specifically, the project will investigate the presence, and decoding, of distributed neural patterns associated with memory for different aspects of experience during wakefulness and identify their reactivation during sleep. The proposal aims to selectively modulate memory via application of novel closed-loop stimulation in sleep in concert with the DL model predictions.  We anticipate that this project is poised to shed light on the relationship between sleep and memory, and its modulation from a novel perspective. Such an ambitious goal can only be achieved with unrivaled combination of experience, access to a clinical setting, and interdisciplinary collaborations such as those proposed in this project. By combining the opportunity to stimulate and record neural activity with the computational power of artificial intelligence, this project aims to offer findings with far reaching implications for basic neuroscience and contribute to the development of novel therapies for human memory disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Memory impairment and disruptions in sleep architecture co-occur in various neurological disorders, suggesting that elucidating the mechanisms underlying the entanglement between memory and sleep may offer the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from memory disorders as well as promote the significance of healthy sleep habits for the general public. The proposed multidisciplinary project seeks a transformative understanding of memory processes and consolidation during sleep by combining the unique capability of direct recordings from the human brain at multiple levels of resolution—single neurons, localized neuronal assemblies, intracranial local field potentials—in neurosurgical patients monitored with intracranial depth electrodes, and computational power of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the project will probe causal mechanisms of consolidation by application of auditory and electrical stimulations—with high temporal and spatial precision— using innovative model-driven closed-loop technology, which can help lay the foundation for future therapeutic interventions of memory disorders.",Decoding and Selective Modulation of Human Memory During Awake/Sleep Cycles,10289993,U01NS123128,"['Acoustic Stimulation ', ' Auditory Stimulation ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Memory ', ' Memory Disorders ', ' Cognitive Retention Disorders ', ' Methodology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' memory recognition ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Sleep Architecture ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Tsunami ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' neural patterning ', ' memory consolidation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' sleep behavior ', ' sleep habit ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2021,1478534,CA-33
"Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients Multiple studies have shown that some patients who remain behaviorally unresponsive after severe brain damage can modulate their brain activity in response to command. A lack of response to the command- following paradigm in other patients, however, cannot be taken as evidence that consciousness is absent. There is thus an urgent need for neuroimaging tools that are able to diagnose covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive subjects without relying on a task. Previous neuroimaging studies of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) have mostly utilized between-state paradigms (e.g., wakefulness vs. sleep) or report-based contrasts, which conflate differences in brain activity supporting consciousness with differences in brain activity supporting behavior or task response. To address these limitations, my sponsor (Dr. Giulio Tononi) has developed a within-state, no-report paradigm that uses serial awakenings to contrast states of consciousness versus unconsciousness during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. Using high density electroencephalography (EEG), his group has shown that the occurrence of dreaming consciousness during sleep is associated with a reduction of delta activity (sleep slow waves) in a posterior cortical ‘hot zone’ encompassing occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. To proceed towards clinical applications, it is now essential to confirm and extend these findings using combined EEG-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). To this effect, in an important new development, Dr. Tononi and collaborators have recently shown that it is possible to faithfully track EEG slow wave activity during sleep by means of a high-frequency (~0.17 Hz) blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation evident in fMRI. This finding provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the NCCs during sleep with high spatial resolution, avoiding potential pitfalls of EEG source modeling, and with unrestricted access to subcortical structures. Taking advantage of these new findings, in this project, I propose to combine the novel fMRI signature of sleep slow waves with a serial awakenings paradigm to locate the NCCs during sleep. Specifically, I will acquire fMRI-EEG data during ~1,080 awakenings from sleep across 40 healthy subjects and investigate the neural correlates of the presence versus absence of dreaming consciousness (Aim 1). I hypothesize that high-frequency BOLD oscillation—which tracks sleep slow-waves—will show regional decreases in specific posterior cortical areas during dreaming compared to dreamless sleep. In Aim 2, I will use univariate and multivariate modeling approaches based on high-frequency BOLD power and conventional BOLD amplitude to identify the NCCs of specific dream contents (e.g., presence of faces) and complexity. If successful, the proposed experiments will constitute an important step forward in identifying brain regions that sustain consciousness and its contents during behaviorally unresponsive states. These results can open new avenues to improve clinical care in patients with a DOC and inform the assessment of intraoperative awareness in anesthetized subjects. Due to previous methodological oversights that confounded consciousness and behavior, the neural substrates of covert consciousness in unresponsive states are poorly understood. The current project will use serial awakenings with dream reports combined with a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of sleep slow waves to identify the neural correlates of both the presence of consciousness and its contents during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. The goal is to help clarify a scientific controversy surrounding the neural basis of consciousness at an unprecedented spatial resolution and with an access to subcortical structures, which could ultimately to improve diagnosis through neuroimaging and clinical care for patients with disorders of consciousness.",Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients,10242202,F32NS114034,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Consciousness Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fellowship ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' selective attention ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Funding ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Vegetative States ', ' Brain region ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Board Certification ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' non rapid eye movement ', ' NREM ', ' non-REM ', ' non-rapid eye movement ', ' nonREM ', ' nonrapid eye movement ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' brain research ', ' cognitive control ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' stimulus processing ', ' fusiform face area ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' clinical care ', ' life-sustaining therapy ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' neural correlate ', ' sensory input ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography ', ' fMRI/EEG ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2021,46696,WI-02
"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions.

"Explainable Deep Learning Approach for Automatic Arousal and Sleep Stages Scoring, and Knowledge Discovery Project Summary Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is potential remedial risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. The prevalence of SDB is estimated to be between 6.5% and 9% in women and between 17% and 31% in men. During polysomnography, which is often required for diagnosis, sleep stages and the frequency of cortical arousals are important metrics. A high frequency of arousals is indicative of sleep fragmentation. Additionally, cortical arousal events are also used to identify hypopneic events in sleep scoring. Currently, type III portable sleep monitors are commonly used for diagnosing SDB severity instead of more expensive polysomnography. However, most portable home sleep test (HST) monitors do not record electroencephalographic (EEG) data which are required for arousal identification, resulting in an underestimation of SDB severity in manual scoring of SDB events. Thus, there is a critical need to improve portable HST sleep monitors with advanced automatic scoring algorithms that can identify arousals associated with SDB events. Studies have found that cortical arousal is associated with sympathetic neural surges observed on electrocardiographic (ECG) and blood pressure signals. Additionally, changes in respiratory patterns, which can be observed from the ECG signal, have been found to be associated with specific EEG patterns. Furthermore, different autonomic neural patterns dominate in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The RR interval and respiratory- mediated HF components of heart rate variability (HRV) increase from stages N1 to N3. Our hypothesis is that ECG signals can be used to automatically scoring sleep stages and arousals in HST. In this study, we plan to develop a deep learning-based multi-task learning algorithm for automatic arousal and sleep stage scoring. Instead of HRV based algorithms, we propose to employ an end-to-end deep learning network to acquire features from the raw ECG data. The proposed model consists of convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and an attention mechanism. It can: (1) accept varying length ECG data; (2) capture long-range dependencies in the ECG data; and (3) share knowledge among scoring tasks for arousal and sleep stages. We use HRVs to further analyze the ECG regions selected by the deep learning model. This is a critical step to understand the underpinnings of associations between sleep events and the ECG signal discovered by the proposed model.  Our specific aims include: (1) developing an end-to-end multitask deep learning model for automatic arousal and sleep stages scoring by analyzing a modified lead II ECG signal which is commonly used in sleep studies; (2) advanced interpretation of deep learning model outcomes. Our current effort will evaluate the usability of deep learning approach in sleep medicine and will have a substantive and sustained impact on diagnosis outcomes for sleep disorders. Project Narrative Home sleep testing (HST) is commonly used to diagnose sleep-disordered breathing. One major issue with HST is that arousal and sleep stages cannot be scored, resulting in underestimation of severity of SDB and inaccurate evaluation of sleep quality. We seek to design a deep learning-based algorithm to score cortical arousal and sleep stages with a single-lead ECG signal and intend to use human intelligible HRVs to explain the new deep learning model identified unprecedent relationships between sleep events and ECG signal.","Explainable Deep Learning Approach for Automatic Arousal and Sleep Stages Scoring, and Knowledge Discovery",10291585,R21HL159661,"['Algorithms ', ' Arousal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep Stages ', ' REM Sleep ', ' Fast-Wave Sleep ', ' Paradoxical Sleep ', ' Rhombencephalic Sleep ', ' dreaming sleep ', ' rapid eye movement sleep ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Woman ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Mediating ', ' Polysomnography ', ' Sleep Monitoring ', ' Somnography ', ' polysomnographic ', ' sleep measurement ', ' sleep polysomnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Sleep Fragmentations ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep illness ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' non rapid eye movement ', ' NREM ', ' non-REM ', ' non-rapid eye movement ', ' nonREM ', ' nonrapid eye movement ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' usability ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' neural patterning ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' learning network ', ' Cardiac health ', ' Heart health ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' Home ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2021,115125,AZ-03
"Brain-behavior vulnerability to sleep loss in children: a dimensional study of attention and impulsivity Project Summary Children and adolescents increasingly experience insufficient or poorly timed sleep as early school start times collide with maturational changes in sleep regulation. However, we lack a deep understanding of both the brain-behavior consequences of this sleep loss and the factors that distinguish which children may be increasingly vulnerable and which are comparatively resilient to its effects. This is particularly salient for the brain-behavior mechanisms underlying attention and impulsivity: two cognitive domains which are acutely impacted by sleep loss, are critical for academic success, and are core aspects of neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD). Attempts to address these issues are hindered by limited mechanistic studies, overreliance on data from adults, and the use of neurotypical samples only. Thus, this R01 project tackles these challenges with a within-subject at-home sleep restriction experiment with combined methods of fMRI, neurocognitive testing, EEG, and circadian physiology to bear on this important problem. We aim to enroll (over five years) 150, 10-13-year-old children across levels of inattention and impulsivity. We will compare a sleep optimized baseline to 5 nights of sleep restriction. Each child is characterized on several attention and impulsivity metrics to compile baseline risk scores for each domain. Resting neural arousal (waking frontal EEG theta power) and circadian timing (melatonin onset phase angle) index sleep-relevant physiology as candidate mechanisms altering a child’s resilience to sleep loss. Repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging using task-based and resting paradigms, with complex modeling of behavior variability characterizes sleep loss’s impact on attention and impulsivity. A performance battery indexes neurocognitive impairments relevant for academic achievement. Finally, machine learning is used to determine examine distinct phenotypes of baseline risk factors and sleep-loss vulnerability in our sample. In sum, this project will advance both NICHD and NIMH’s goal to understand mechanisms of complex behavior; here, consequences and mediators of sleep loss for children. Project Narrative Chronic insufficient sleep during the school week is an ever present concern for children and adolescents with consequences particularly for attention and impulsivity. We currently lack an ability to mechanistically detect which child will be most vulnerable to insuffient sleep. To address this need, we propose an at-home sleep restriction experiment mirroring a school week, with neuroimaging, performance testing, and assays of neural arousal and circadian timing to untangle factors altering children with severe attention and impulsivity experience the consequences of sleep loss.",Brain-behavior vulnerability to sleep loss in children: a dimensional study of attention and impulsivity,10297377,R01HD103665,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Collection ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Melatonin ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Deprivation ', ' deficient sleep ', ' inadequate sleep ', ' insufficient sleep ', ' sleep debt ', ' sleep deficiency ', ' sleep deficit ', ' sleep insufficiency ', ' sleep loss ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' sleep control ', ' sleep regulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' memory recall ', ' simulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Excessive daytime somnolence ', ' Excessive Daytime Sleepiness ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 13 year old ', ' 13 years of age ', ' age 13 years ', ' thirteen year old ', ' thirteen years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' comparative ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' cognitive development ', ' sustained attention ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' circadian ', ' Home ', ' ']",NICHD,EMMA PENDLETON BRADLEY HOSPITAL,R01,2021,550108,RI-01
"Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Depression has an enormous impact: it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 264 million people of all ages. Moreover, major depression at any age doubles the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, which affect over 50 million people worldwide — a number projected to triple by 2050. Interventions for depression in older adults have limited efficacy to date, and directly treating cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer’s Disease is not feasible or effective. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors that favorably influence both depression and cognition before dementia onset is an urgent public health need. Sleep is one such risk factor. However, sleep is not a uni-dimensional construct represented by merely its duration or the presence/absence of a sleep disorder. Rather sleep is multidimensional: it is comprised of multiple domains (e.g., Regularity, Satisfaction, Sleepiness, Timing, Efficiency, Duration) and measured on multiple levels (e.g. self-report or behavioral [via actigraphy]). In our initial R01, we leveraged our biostatistical and sleep expertise to develop and hone methods for examining multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of mortality in a high- dimensional machine learning (ML) context that flexibly accounts for the complex interactions that exist among sleep and non-sleep risk factors. We now seek to build on the success of the initial funding period by using our novel methods to examine multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of changes in cognition and depressive symptoms. To enhance generalizability and power, we are developing a Pooled Sample of N~3,400 adults aged ≥65 without cognitive impairment from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study, Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). With these methods and data, we will examine multidimensional sleep health for predicting changes in global cognition and incident dementia (Aim 1) and depressive symptoms (Aim 2) in a high-dimensional machine learning context. We will also examine depression as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts impaired cognition (Aim 3). Our Secondary Aims are to: (a) apply parallel methods in two additional cohorts (the Rotterdam Study and Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) to replicate and extend our findings to cohorts with different demographic profiles and clinical Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias diagnoses; (b) examine effects by sex and race; and (c) identify the sleep health characteristics driving overall effects. Identifying multidimensional sleep health profiles that reliably predict changes in global cognition, incident dementia, and changes in depressive symptoms in a realistic, high dimensional context will directly inform the design of novel targeted interventions and prospective studies focused on preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. Moreover, we will amplify the impact of our work by demonstrating new methods for studying health and depositing harmonized data on the National Sleep Research Resource to facilitate future multi-cohort secondary analyses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias are among the leading contributors to morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. This project will apply novel machine learning techniques to large multi-cohort samples to determine whether multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes (change in cognition, incident dementia; Aim 1) and change in depressive symptoms (Aim 2), and examine depressive symptoms as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes. Through our multi-cohort secondary data analysis approach, which offers enhanced generalizability and power and an efficient use of existing resources, our findings will directly inform the design of subsequent prospective studies aimed at developing integrated approaches to treating depression and cognitive decline in older adults, with implications for preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.",Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications,10209375,RF1AG056331,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drowsiness ', ' Somnolence ', ' sleepiness ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' indexing ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Medical Records ', ' Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Cardiovascular implications of sleep characteristics using real-world objective sleep data Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S. Impaired sleep is recognized as a strong risk factor of CVD. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, abnormal sleep duration, and poor sleep quality have each been associated with CVD-related morbidity and mortality. Major limitations of existing studies on sleep and CVD is the lack of objective sleep measurement and the lack of understanding of the multi-dimensional nature of sleep and its complex interactions with CVD. In addition, emerging evidence also suggests potential relationships between sleep disorders and preclinical CV conditions, which often occur before the clinical manifestation of CVD. Blood pressure parameters including systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) are examples of preclinical CVD that have prognostic value for future CV events. However, no research has yet explored if sleep disorders beyond OSA (such as impaired sleep quality and abnormal sleep duration) are risk factors attributable to preclinical CV conditions. This is a critical area of inquiry since understanding the complex relationships between sleep and preclinical and clinical CV conditions will allow healthcare providers to implement targeted interventions to reduce CVD. The proposed study will examine whether PSG-derived objective measures of sleep obtained in the clinical setting would be predictive of CVD and preclinical CVD. Given that hypertension is one of the major important CV risks and has been most well studied CV risk factor in relation to sleep, SBPV, mean SBP, and other blood pressure metrics will be the focus of the preclinical CVD. Our main aim is to examine the relationships between multidimensional sleep characteristics (in terms of duration, efficiency, quality, and disordered sleep breathing) and clinical CV conditions, after adjusting for personal, clinical, and other confounders. We will use sleep data collected from more than 7,000 individuals who completed a diagnostic sleep study at the University of Virginia Health System in 2010 - 2018. Machine learning (ML) models will be used to analyze the multidimensional PSG measures. This proposed study represents the largest real-world dataset on objective sleep measures, which will allow us to simultaneously examine the entire spectrum of sleep and advance our understanding about the impact of sleep on CV outcomes. Project Narrative Impaired sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other adverse health outcomes. We will examine how various dimensions of sleep including duration, efficiency, and disordered breathing from polysomnography are related to cardiovascular risk within a healthcare setting. To better understand the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism, we will examine how sleep measures may affect blood pressure variability, an emerging yet underappreciated blood pressure parameter to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.",Cardiovascular implications of sleep characteristics using real-world objective sleep data,10256810,R21HL150502,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Engineering ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' indexing ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Respiration Disorders ', ' Respiratory Disorder ', ' breathing disorder ', ' respiratory dysfunction ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' REM Sleep ', ' Fast-Wave Sleep ', ' Paradoxical Sleep ', ' Rhombencephalic Sleep ', ' dreaming sleep ', ' rapid eye movement sleep ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Polysomnography ', ' Sleep Monitoring ', ' Somnography ', ' polysomnographic ', ' sleep measurement ', ' sleep polysomnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Cardiovascular Manifestation ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive ', ' Obstructive Sleep Apnea ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' limb movement ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep illness ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Insomnia ', ' Insomnia Disorder ', ' Sleeplessness ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Sleep Architecture ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' sleep abnormalities ', ' effective intervention ', ' risk minimization ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' clinical predictors ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' blood pressure variability ', ' sleep quantity ', ' poor sleep ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,123101,WA-07
"Robust Characterization of Brain-Heart Coupling Across Development and Modulations by Disordered Sleep ABSTRACT Balanced communication between the brain and heart is critical to both cardiovascular and cognitive health. Although the anatomical pathways facilitating this communication have been well characterized, the electrodynamic coupling between the two systems remains elusive, particularly during development. A distributed network of brain structures that regulates cardiac function undergoes profound changes and reorganization during the first two decades of life. The impact of these anatomical changes and postnatal heart maturation on cerebro-cardiovascular coupling is poorly understood. Yet, this is a fundamental mechanism that, if impaired, may lead to significant deficits in both systems. At the macroscale of the intact human brain and heart, simultaneously acquired electrophysiological data may provide transformative new insights into both electrodynamic system coupling and its modulation by disorders and stressors. To date, the adverse effects of such stressors, particularly unhealthy sleep associated with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a disorder that affects up to 10% of children in the US, on this electrodynamic coupling during wakefulness and sleep remain poorly understood. This project aims to significantly improve the field’s knowledge through two potentially transformative contributions. Aim 1 will develop a blueprint of normal electrodynamic interaction between the developing brain and heart, during wakefulness and sleep, by leveraging the large volume of existing data from clinical physiological studies (which include both EEG and ECG) from patients with no evidence of underlying disease. A total of n ~= 1400 patients, with simultaneous EEG and ECG, spanning in age infancy to young adulthood will be analyzed using cutting-edge signal and machine learning tools and models, to establish a typical developmental trajectory of the electrodynamic interaction between the brain and heart. Aim 2 will use this blueprint to systematically investigate the adverse impact of disordered sleep on cerebro-cardiovascular coupling in 453 children with OSA (ages 5-10 years) and ~400 children with snoring (who did not meet criteria for OSA), using publicly available polysomnography data from the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT). Dynamic EEG-ECG interactions at baseline and follow up will be compared to normal system coupling in the same age range, estimated in Aim 1. Deviations from normative coupling will be investigated as a function of cognitive outcomes. Clinical physiology/polysomnography studies contain a wealth of valuable information but remain severely underutilized. This project will leverage these Big Data to robustly characterize a fundamental yet currently elusive mechanism that may affect both cognitive and cardiovascular health across the lifespan. In addition, the establishment of a normative developmental trajectory of cerebro-cardiovascular coupling may become a significant research resource for future studies. Findings may provide transformative insights into the communication between the two organs, necessary to maintain their respective long-term health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using novel signal processing and machine learning tools and Big Physiological Data from existing clinical studies and the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT), this project aims to first develop a blueprint of electrodynamic cardiovascular-neural coupling during wakefulness and sleep and robustly characterize its developmental trajectory. This blueprint of the two systems’ electrodynamic interaction will then be used to elucidate the adverse impact of disordered sleep (as a result of Obstructive Sleep Apnea), in children age 5-10 years. Findings from this project may have a transformative impact on the field’s understanding of the dynamic communication between the brain and heart and its modulation by unhealthy/insufficient sleep, a significant problem in children with potentially profound implications for cognitive and cardiovascular health across the lifespan.",Robust Characterization of Brain-Heart Coupling Across Development and Modulations by Disordered Sleep,10293076,R21HL156186,"['sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep illness ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' critical period ', ' arm ', ' signal processing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' clinical database ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity -

"The Role of Sleep Health in Proximal Suicide Risk among Ultra-High Risk Adolescents ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people age 14–24, and rates in this age group are increasing. Most suicide risk factors are distal (i.e., long-standing, static), thus informative regarding who is at risk, but not when. As such, our ability to reliably predict near-term suicide risk among vulnerable populations remains grossly inadequate. Studies consistently demonstrate a link between subjective sleep disturbances and the continuum of suicidality. Yet, sleep is a complex behavior that can be measured along multiple dimensions and at varying levels of analysis. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the role of normative biological and psychosocial developmental processes that further contribute to dynamic changes in risk related to sleep disturbance. Such changes in sleep are particularly dramatic during adolescence. Studies also have not examined how sleep interacts with other known pathways, such as dysregulation in affective, cognitive and arousal-related systems, to lead to suicidality in vulnerable youth. We thus propose to conduct an 8-week prospective multi-method study of sleep health and suicidal thoughts and behavior in a transdiagnostic sample of ultra-high risk adolescents (14-18) who have recently enrolled in an Intensive Outpatient or Partial Hospitalization Program. We will capitalize on the extant clinical and research infrastructures to compare sleep-suicide associations and plausible affective, cognitive and arousal-related mechanisms using self-report, behavioral, lab task paradigms and physiology in adolescents at ultra-high risk for suicide. Project Narrative Despite the enormous public health problem of suicide among adolescents, little progress has been made toward improving assessment and prevention for this vulnerable group. We will conduct a prospective, longitudinal study to examine the near-term temporal associations between within-person fluctuations in sleep disturbance, dysregulation in affective, cognitive and arousal-related systems, and changes in suicidality over time in ultra-high risk adolescents. Critically, since sleep is a modifiable risk factor, our findings hold great promise to inform the development or modification of existing sleep/mental health interventions to lower suicide risk.",The Role of Sleep Health in Proximal Suicide Risk among Ultra-High Risk Adolescents,10107391,R01MH124907,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Day Care ', ' Partial Hospitalization ', ' Treatment Day Care ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Task Performances ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' sleep control ', ' sleep regulation ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep illness ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' cost ', ' Behavioral inhibition ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' Affective ', ' cognitive control ', ' high risk ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' high-risk adolescents ', ' mood symptom ', ' outpatient programs ', ' outpatient services ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' sleep health ', ' sleep hygiene ', ' sleep behavior ', ' sleep habit ', ' poor sleep ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,766370,PA-18
"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities. Also, this project has the added benefit of providing information about the role of sleep as a potentially modifiable factor in cardiovascular disease and diabetes disparities as well.",Sleep and

"CRCNS: Unsupervised Learning of Hippocampal Sequence Dynamic in Sleep   In unit recordings from large populations of neurons, fast compressed sequential firing of neurons during rest and early sleep have been found to replay patterns first observed in active awake experience. These remarkable patterns have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community and beyond. Sequence  replay is now considered to play a critical role in the long-term stabilization and storage of mnemonically  important information. However, despite the general acknowledgement of the importance of the sequential structure, very little is known about the null background against which replay is compared. Specifically, are apparently 'non-replaying' spike patterns, as seen in late sleep, just simply noise? Because replay is typically assessed by comparison against a fixed known template, most methods can only determine whether the resemblance to the template is more than what might be expected from  random spike trains. But these methods cannot appraise whether other patterns remain in the nonsignificant events. Recently, the Diba and Kemere labs successfully collaborated to address precisely  this issue. We developed methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) to uncover temporal structure in spike trains of neurons in an unsupervised template-free manner. In this proposal, we aim to further improve these methods and to evaluate the hidden structure of spike trains in hippocampal  neuronal populations during sleep. In our second specific aim, we will use HMMs to determine both co-active ensemble (""contextual"") and temporal patterns (""sequential"") structure in hippocampal spike trains in both pre- and post-task sleep. In the third specific aim, we will probe the essence of sleep replay further, by exposing animals to multiple novel and familiar maze environments prior to long durations of sleep. In the fourth specific aim, we will perform closed-loop disruption of neuronal population patterns to  examine the causal interplay and reverberation of these patterns from early to late sleep. In summary, our  proposal is designed to provide strongest characterization to date of the structure of ""noise"" in replay events. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This study will provide an opening to evaluate the role of sleep in reorganizing information in the brain and  help to identify critical time windows and neuronal activities during sleep which are particularly important  for information storage and stabilization. Our assumptions and deductions about the nature and purpose  of sleep implicitly inform all manner of public policy, from the durations of shifts for hospital and relief  workers, to morning start times of public schools.

"Novel machine learning and missing data methods for improving estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep using accelerometer data PROJECT SUMMARY We propose novel statistical and machine learning methods for processing and analyzing accelerometer data for studying physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep and their effects on outcomes such as cardiovascular health. Methods to accurately estimate and characterize physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep are crucially needed. Accelerometers have been widely adopted as the standard objective measure of movement in free-living humans. Recent advances have spawned instruments that collect enormous amounts of data that has far outpaced the research community’s ability to meaningfully interpret them. Current studies rely on outdated methods for identifying non-wear and addressing missing data, potentially yielding biased and inefficient estimates of relationships between behavioral activity patterns and outcomes. Importantly, methods for distinguishing between non-wear periods and those that represent sedentary behavior or sleep have not been validated using a gold standard in free-living contexts. The handling of non-wear periods using a statistically valid approach that exploits the multivariate and time- series nature of the data has yet to be developed. Thus, new methods are needed to address current gaps. We propose developing and validating an ensemble classifier to distinguish non-wear time. We will adapt and validate multiple imputation methods that exploit the multivariate and time-series nature of the data to handle non-wear time in analyses that make use of entire profiles of physical activity. Specifically, we will evaluate methods for incorporating multiple imputation for handling missing data from non-wear when applying adaptive clustering algorithms to identify distinct patterns of sleep and activity in order to relate them to outcomes in a generalized linear mixed effects model framework. We will create open-source user-friendly software that can be adopted and enhanced by the research community. Our approach integrates three novel data resources to develop our methods – two with knowledge of true activity and non-wear, and a third generated from a unique four-year longitudinal time series for both accelerometry and cardiovascular risk factor measures in a real- world setting. It offers an opportunity to develop and illustrate methods using data generated from wearable devices in a natural environment that includes missing data. This is the first study to incorporate missing data methods into learning algorithms under a generalized linear mixed effects model framework for accelerometer studies. Such methods will be critical for both observational and clinical trial research in real-world settings, where wear and non-wear time are not directly observed. The resulting insights and tools will also be highly applicable to the processing and analysis of other types of intensively sampled serial data, such as those generated from mobile digital devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to fill important gaps in current methods by developing a comprehensive set of tools to analyze accelerometer data to better understand the links between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep and outcomes such as cardiovascular health, and to make open-source user-friendly software available to apply them. We propose methods to identify and account for non-wear periods through machine learning and multiple imputation approaches under a generalized linear mixed effects model framework in order to correlate behaviors with outcomes. The methods we develop and validate will be useful for studying questions of great importance to public health such as identifying signature patterns of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep that may be favorable for cardiovascular health and will provide insights into analytic approaches for studies that involve other types of monitoring data with public health relevance.","Novel machine learning and missing data methods for improving estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep using accelerometer data",10120571,R01LM013355,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Environment ', ' Fasting ', ' fasted ', ' fasts ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sedentary ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' waist circumference ', ' interest ', ' monitoring device ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' diabetes risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Security ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' obesity in children ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' digital ', ' markov model ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard measure ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' health data ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' data resource ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' sleep behavior ', ' sleep habit ', ' learning algorithm ', ' sleep pattern ', ' Visualization ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,328975,CA-18
"DORMIR: Determinants, Outcomes, Responses and Markers of  Insufficient sleep in Rural-Urban settings Project Summary The widening gap in all-cause and CVD-mortality and morbidity rates in rural and urban America is at an all- time high. Latino/as, the largest minority ethnic group in the U.S., appear to be most affected by rural-urban divide in CVD outcomes, as they are disproportionately burdened by CVD risk (overweight/obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes) and CVD mortality (20%, 2nd leading cause of death among Latino/as) relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Unlike other groups where individuals in rural and urban areas have differing CVD risk, rural and urban Latino/as have similarly high rates of CVD risk. Although, healthy diets/ nutrition, smoking cessation, and regular physical activity are linked to CVD risk, they have not been very effective in reducing the CVD burden among racial/ethnic groups, specifically among Latino/as. Several studies indicate that insufficient sleep (<7hrs./day) explains a significant amount of the CVD burden among Latino/as. Preliminary evidence indicates that insufficient sleep may contribute to the observed CVD burden among Latino/as, as Latino/as have greater odds of experiencing insufficient sleep compared with non-Hispanic whites. Evidence also shows that insufficient sleep, which is associated with potentially life-threatening CVD, is a key modifiable risk factor with great potential to reduce health disparities. However, it is unclear what factors contribute to insufficient sleep (IS) disparities and IS-related CVD burden among rural and urban Latino/as. To address these gaps, we will enroll 525 Latino/as in rural and urban communities to participate in home-based studies using novel mHealth devices. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify behavioral, genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors that are associated with insufficient sleep and IS-related CVD and 2) assess effects of insufficient sleep on CVD risk markers (obesity, blood pressure, lipid profile, and fasting plasma glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammatory risk markers (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α). This study will provide multi-level evidence supporting epidemiological findings of greater rates of insufficient sleep among Latino/as, which may explain their disproportionate burden of CVD risk. It will also assess whether and why rural and urban differences in IS exist among Latino/as and how that may lead to IS-related CVD outcomes. These data will provide: 1) the foundation for interventions to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep on CVD health outcomes, 2) evidence to delineate factors underlying insufficient sleep and CVD burden among Latino/as in rural and urban settings, and 3) a possible explanation of behavioral, genetic, environmental and psychosocial determinants of insufficient sleep and related CVD risk factors in rural and urban Latino/as. Findings can lead to actionable clinical, lifestyle, and policy interventions to improve Latino health. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that Latino/as exhibit a greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation. It will provide multi-level evidence on behavioral, genetic, psychosocial and environmental determinants of insufficient sleep and sleep-related CVD risk and inflammation markers among rural and urban Latino/as. These data will provide the foundation for interventions to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep on health outcomes.","DORMIR: Determinants, Outcomes, Responses and Markers of  Insufficient sleep in Rural-Urban settings",10254265,R01HL152453,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air ', ' Americas ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Household ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Inflammation ', ' instrumentation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Investigating the role of memory reactivation during REM sleep for plasticity Project Summary Memory reactivation, which occurs during both wakefulness and sleep, is a leading candidate mechanism for how new information is consolidated to form long-term memories. Influential theories propose complementary roles for how reactivation benefits consolidation during both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—NREM sleep strengthens new memories in cortical networks (systems consolidation) and REM sleep reorganizes memories within local networks (synaptic plasticity). Over the last two decades, myriad studies have contributed to our understanding of NREM sleep and systems consolidation. The role of REM sleep, however, largely remains a mystery, possibly because prior work has not been tuned to detect REM sleep-dependent memory effects. We propose that REM sleep plays a crucial role in promoting representational change, specifically by decreasing neural overlap between related memories (differentiation), which reduces competition during subsequent memory retrievals. We will conduct experiments, complemented by neural network modeling, to test how competitive learning and memory reactivation during NREM and REM sleep affect how memories relate to each other in representational space and how much they compete during subsequent learning and retrieval. Our first aim is to run experiments where we experimentally manipulate levels of competition during wakeful learning. To track evidence of learning-specific memory reactivation during subsequent sleep, we will “inject” decodable information into the learning experience and use machine learning classifiers to distinguish these learning conditions from sleeping EEG brain activity alone. We will use fMRI to track competitive dynamics and quantify representational change, and demonstrate the behavioral consequences of this differentiation—less neural overlap should reduce interference and promote new learning. Our second aim will use computational models to test predictions about how neural representations change during NREM and REM sleep, and how these changes impact behavior. The model will be tuned using Aim 1 experimental data, and will generate predictions to inform Aim 3 experiments. Our third aim is to run experiments where we experimentally bias the learning-related content of reactivation during NREM sleep. We will examine how our NREM reactivation manipulation modulates reactivation during subsequent REM sleep, and whether REM sleep is necessary for this NREM manipulation to have an effect on memory outcomes. The proposed studies use a novel combination of state-of-the-art approaches, including: (1) machine learning to decode memory content from sleeping EEG brain activity; (2) multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data to track representational change; (3) behavioral measures sensitive to representational change; (4) neural network modeling to identify the mechanisms underlying NREM- and REM-related plasticity; and (5) NREM-based targeted memory reactivation to test how memory processing during NREM and REM sleep interact. Project Narrative Approximately 70 million people in the United States suffer from disordered sleep, including people with neurological disorders associated with sleep disturbances. Sleep is critical for learning and memory, and the proposed studies will help us understand underlying mechanisms of these sleep-related memory benefits. Knowing how to target sleep as an intervention to effectively bring about positive memory outcomes could inform public health sleep initiatives and new treatments for memory impairments in clinical populations with sleep disturbances.",Investigating the role of memory reactivation during REM sleep for plasticity,10192124,K99MH126154,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' rapid eye movement ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Sleep Stages ', ' REM Sleep ', ' Fast-Wave Sleep ', ' Paradoxical Sleep ', ' Rhombencephalic Sleep ', ' dreaming sleep ', ' rapid eye movement sleep ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' longterm memory ', ' long term memory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' memory retention ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep illness ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' theories ', ' neuropathology ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' non rapid eye movement ', ' NREM ', ' non-REM ', ' non-rapid eye movement ', ' nonREM ', ' nonrapid eye movement ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' neural patterning ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' sleep health ', ' sleep hygiene ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,113862,NJ-12
"Unraveling the Locus Coeruleus Circuitry in Opioidinduced Sleep Disturbances PROJECT SUMMARY The main goals of this training proposal is 1) to provide Li Li, MD, PhD, a practicing anesthesiologist at the University of Washington, with additional scientific and professional skills to facilitate his transition to become an independent investigator, and 2) to better understand how the locus coeruleus (LC), at the cellular and circuit levels, contributes to opioid-induced sleep disturbances. Studying sleep disturbances caused by opioids is important because opioids have enormous societal impact, causing over 46,000 overdose deaths in 2018 and almost $80 billion in economic cost annually in the United States; and because recent studies have implicated several aspects of sleep disturbances caused by opioids, including poorer cognition, decreased pain tolerance, and increased negative affect, in contributing to chronic opioid use and relapse. Interestingly, the LC and paraventricular thalamus (PVT) are two brain regions that modulate sleep-wake balance and mediate withdrawal behaviors from opioids, but their roles in opioid-induced sleep disturbances are relatively unknown. Thus, during his K99 phase, Dr. Li aims to 1) examine LC neuronal activity in relation to sleep patterns in a mouse model of acute and chronic opioid administration and 2) determine the role of local opioid receptors in the LC in opioid- induced sleep disturbances. Furthermore, he plans to receive training in 1-photon microendoscopic imaging, optogenetic manipulation of opioid receptors, and cell-specific drug targeting using drug acutely restricted by tethering (DART); and will be mentored by Prof. Michael Bruchas, a world-renowned expert in opioid neurobiology, and a committee of experts in neural circuitry analysis, sleep, and substance abuse disorders. Together, his training will help transition to his independent R00 phase, where he plans to use his trained skills 1) to examine PVT neuronal activity in relation to sleep patterns in acute and chronic opioid administration, and to determine role of local opioid receptors in PVT in opioid-induced sleep disturbances. Studies in the independent phase will prepare him for a future R01 submission to further examine arousal neural circuitry response to sedative and anesthetic drugs. Thus, this proposal aims to characterize the LC-PVT circuit in a mouse model of acute and chronic opioid administration using cutting-edge tools in neural circuit analysis and cell-specific pharmacology in order to better understand the cellular and circuit mechanism underlying opioid- induced sleep disturbances, and provides the essential training and mentorship for Dr. Li to help him achieve his career goal of starting his own lab and becoming an independent investigator. PROJECTIVE NARRATIVE Despite the opioid epidemic causing over 46,000 overdose deaths in 2018, opioids remain important drugs for treating acute pain after surgery, and consequently put surgical patients at risk for their myriad of side effects and for chronic opioid use. As recent studies have implicated opioid-induced sleep disturbances as a contributing factor to opioid dependence and relapse, the proposed studies aim to better understand the neurobiological mechanism by which opioids disrupt sleep acutely and chronically. Together, these new findings may offer a new approach in treating those suffering from opioid addiction, and new insights into the role of acute opioid use in sleep disturbances after surgery.",Unraveling the Locus Coeruleus Circuitry in Opioidinduced Sleep Disturbances,10187134,K99DA053336,"['Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Arousal ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electromyography ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' locus ceruleus structure ', ' Locus Coeruleus ', ' Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis ', ' blue nucleus ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morphine ', ' Infumorph ', ' Kadian ', ' MS Contin ', ' MSir ', ' Morphia ', ' Oramorph ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Statex SR ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Naloxone ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neuropharmacology ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' opioid withdrawal ', ' opiate withdrawal ', ' opioid detox ', ' opioid detoxification ', ' Oxymorphone ', ' Methylnaloxone ', ' N-Methylnaloxone ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' pain after surgery ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Photometry ', ' Physicians ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Relapse ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saline ', ' Saline Solution ', ' sedative ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Virus ', ' Washington ', ' mu opioid receptors ', ' μ opioid receptors ', ' μ-OR ', ' μOR ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Mediating ', ' Photons ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' pain tolerance ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' awake ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' skills training ', ' calcium indicator ', ' receptor expression ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' skills ', ' economic cost ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' receptor function ', ' Brain region ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Receptor Cell ', ' in vivo ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' dependence relapse ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' optogenetics ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' Injections ', ' morphine administration ', ' side effect ', ' sleep pattern ', ' conditional knockout ', ' conditional knock-out ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2021,175014,WA-07
"Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks Project Summary Translational studies showing a mechanistic interplay between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and sleep/circadian disruption has renewed interest in the maxim ‘sleep is of the brain, by the brain, and for the brain’. Relative to adults sleeping well, those exhibiting sleep deficiency (SD), defined as poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment, have greater AD risk (OR=1.55), cognitive decline (OR=1.68), or preclinical AD (OR=3.78). Since SD is observed early in the course of AD, it constitutes a prime target for prevention. Notwithstanding successes in delineating the mechanisms and functions of sleep, a critical gap remains in elucidating factors undergirding sleep disparities among blacks, marked by a greater AD risk burden. Blacks also shoulder a greater sleep burden as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the main SD indices, which are linked to increased vascular risks, inflammation, brain injury, and cognitive impairment. The multi-disciplinary team will utilize innovative dynamic and geospatial modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants of SD and its putative effects on the brain health of older blacks. We will leverage the success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup, comprising investigators with expertise in aging research, translational sleep and circadian sciences, brain health, health disparities, and geospatial and multi-level dynamic modeling. We will leverage the social capital and assets of our Community Steering Committee to enroll 504 blacks (60-75 years) from traditional and non-traditional venues to capture study endpoints. We will investigative the following aims: 1) To ascertain the psychosocial (social/emotional support, mood, discrimination, attitudes) and environmental (household [density, noise, air quality, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with SD; 2) To assess effects of SD on markers of brain injury (Hcy, NFL, GFAP, Tau & Amyloid-β peptides) and on neurocognitive functions (attention, language, memory, and executive function using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and Trail Making Test). The contributions of vascular risk (obesity, BP, lipid, and glucose/HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) will be weighted; 3) To characterize blacks who are at increased risk of SD using Bayesian machine-learning modeling and forecast through Agent-Based modeling which amalgamation of psychosocial and environmental changes will lead to a reduced SD burden and related brain health profile among older blacks over time (5, 10, & 20 yrs.). The investigative team will use novel home-based digital recorders, innovative brain health biomarkers, geospatial analytics and dynamic systems modeling to describe the mechanisms of SD and delineate their potential role in explaining observed disparities in markers of brain health of older blacks. Project Narrative Despite the high risk for sleep-related morbidity, there is a paucity of data on sleep-disrupting psychosocial and environmental stressors associated with sleep deficiency (poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment) among older blacks. Our multi-disciplinary team will use novel mHealth devices recording sleep/activity cycles, light, noise, air quality, temperature, and greenspace exposure; novel brain biomarkers; and geospatial analytics to assess effects on sleep deficiency and delineate their role in explaining disparities in the brain and cognitive health of older blacks.",Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks,10149911,R01AG067523,"['Activity Cycles ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Exhibits ', ' Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein ', ' Astroprotein ', ' GFA-Protein ', ' GFAP ', ' Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein ', ' Glial Intermediate Filament Protein ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Maxim ', ' Memory ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity -

"Sleep Based Memory Consolidation in Juvenile Zebra Finch Project Summary Sleep is thought to play a significant contribution in the consolidation of multiple forms of memories during development. Transient disruptions of sleep often lead to delays and losses in learned skilled behaviors. While research has made great progress in understanding the role of sleep in the hippocampal dependent learning of explicit memories, how sleep influences the synaptic circuits involved in learning perceptual and procedural memories is still poorly understood. Songbirds provide an unmatched opportunity to study sleep based consolidation of skilled motor behaviors. Juvenile songbirds learn their courtship song through extensive daily practice, producing tens of thousands of renditions by adulthood. Daily, auditory-feedback guided improvements in song are hypothesized to be consolidated nightly during sleep, enabling renewed vocal exploration and continued refinement of song performances through development. My predoctoral research seeks to identify the synaptic circuits involved in sleep-based consolidation of song and the long-term impact of transient disruptions in these circuits during song development. By combining in vivo pharmacological manipulations with machine learning-based approaches for segregating and analyzing changes in singing behavior, I have identified at least one nuclei governing the sleep-based consolidation of complex motor behaviors. Remaining work to be done during the F99 phase will focus on the specific contributions of individual premotor synaptic circuits using synapse-specific pharmacology in conjunction with pathway specific chemogenetics. Also during the F99 phase, I will follow up on unexpected findings to determine the evolutionary relevance of song diversity in mate choice. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide a specific plan to find an ideal mentor and research environment for enhancing my knowledge and technical skills of neuroinvasion and propagation of viruses leading to generation of novel viral vectors for the effective dissection of neural circuits. Together, the research and training detailed in the two phases of this proposal will allow me to achieve my long-term goal of engineering sophisticated tools to understand the molecular, cellular, and synaptic basis of learned complex motor behaviors as a tenured principal investigator. Project Narrative Although the role of sleep has been studied in many different contexts, little effort has been dedicated to understanding the role of sleep in the acquisition of communicativebehaviors. With a well-defined neural circuitry underlying a robust and stereotyped learned behavior, along with evidence pointing to changes in song structure during sleep, the songbird is exceptionally suited for examining sleep-based learning mechanisms. Byidentifying circuits mechanisms involved in memory consolidation we will stand better equipped to help those affected by sleep disturbances.",Sleep Based Memory Consolidation in Juvenile Zebra

"Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY People vary in both the quantity and the quality of their sleep. Traditional sleep “stages” (for example, slow- wave sleep or REM sleep) can exhibit different neural correlates (as measured by electroencephalography, EEG) in different people and at different times during the night. Standard approaches for characterizing sleep (“staging”) do not take this variability into account, however. Here we suggest that attempts to use EEG and other data to infer sleep stages should in fact tackle the heterogeneity between and within individuals explicitly, to yield more accurate classification not just of an individual’s minute-by-minute sleep, but of the sleeper’s typical characteristics more generally. Quantitative, data-driven individual sleep profiles will be important prerequisites for emerging large-scale molecular genetics and other ‘omics studies of sleep, and for driving personalized sleep medicine more generally. Specifically, we propose to leverage more than ten thousand whole-night polysomnography (PSG) studies from the demographically diverse National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), in order to optimally apply machine-learning methods to sleep signals. Most importantly, the NSRR dataset will enable approaches that take the fundamental heterogeneity of sleep into account: this is a rate-limiting step that has not been tackled by previous approaches. We hypothesize that it is not the large training set per se, but rather the increased prospects for better-matched training data, combined with the methods developed here, that will be beneficial. To this end, we will build and disseminate a novel, multi-level automated sleep classifier based on the world’s largest dataset of sleep signals. PROJECT NARRATIVE People vary considerably not just in how much they sleep, but also in the types of sleep they typically have. Standard approaches to describing sleep, primarily developed in the 1960s, only partially capture this variability: we propose to use a range of measures, including brain activity, on over ten thousand sleeping individuals to generate more accurate, data-driven, personalized profiles of how a person's sleep varies over a night. Sleep factors are associated with multiple physical and neuropsychiatric illnesses, and so better measurement of the underlying processes will be critical for future genetic and biomarker studies aimed at understanding the links between sleep, health and disease.",Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling,10084929,R01HL146339,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mythology ', ' Persons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Stages ', ' REM Sleep ', ' Fast-Wave Sleep ', ' Paradoxical Sleep ', ' Rhombencephalic Sleep ', ' dreaming sleep ', ' rapid eye movement sleep ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Polysomnography ', ' Sleep Monitoring ', ' Somnography ', ' polysomnographic ', ' sleep measurement ', ' sleep polysomnography ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' Greek ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' heuristics ', ' trait ', ' Stretching ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' Property ', ' sleep onset ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' molecular scale ', ' Sleep Architecture ', ' Stage I Sleep ', ' Stage 1 Sleep ', ' Stage II Sleep ', ' Stage 2 Sleep ', ' non rapid eye movement ', ' NREM ', ' non-REM ', ' non-rapid eye movement ', ' nonREM ', ' nonrapid eye movement ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' demographics ', ' real world application ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' neural correlate ', ' implicit bias ', ' data resource ', ' sleep health ', ' sleep hygiene ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,444813,MA-07
"Down Syndrome: Toward Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS -TO-THE-MAX) PROJECT ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS), a trisomy of chromosome 21 and the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, was once a condition in which children would rarely see adulthood. In 1950, the estimated mean life expectancy for a person with DS was 26 years and median age at death was 4 years. With improvements in recognition and treatment of co-occurring conditions of DS, such as congenital heart defects, the estimated median life expectancy in 2010 was 53 years (median age at death was 58). There is now a large and diverse population with DS across all ages who are in dire need of solutions and treatments for medical issues that were inconceivable 60 years ago. Two conditions of high interest that often presage other morbidity, greatly harm quality of life, and lead to premature mortality are obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and dementia. OSA is an episodic sleep-state collapse of the upper airway which results in reduction or lack of ventilation during sleep and is prevalent in more than half of people with DS. The triplication of chromosome 21 in DS is associated with an overproduction of the amyloid precursor protein and is pivotal to the accelerated development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Even when not the proximal cause of death, in post-mortem autopsy nearly all older adults with DS have beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that signify Alzheimer's disease. More needs to be known about causes, course, and the impact of social determinants on these conditions and resulting premature mortality, especially as clinical DS samples are often under powered and often lack participants of color. To meet the directives of the National Institutes of Health's Investigation of Co-occurring conditions across the lifespan in Down syndrome project and the National Institute on Aging's priorities we propose to create Down Syndrome: Towards Optimal Trajectories and Health Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS-TO-THE-MAX). DS-TO-THE-MAX will identify a retrospective longitudinal cohort of >100,000 adults with DS and >4,000,000 adults without DS from 10 years of Medicaid Analytic eXtract data plus additional Medicare data for dual enrollees. Our innovation lies in a DS sample orders of magnitude larger than past work, a social determinants of health framework, and novel machine learning and quantitative bias analysis methods. We will complete two aims: 1) Assess epidemiology and social determinants of obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality 2) Use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and mortality. The results of this project will strengthen the epidemiologic and public health basis for DS research and population level intervention. In building the DS-TO THE MAX cohort and assessing risk, resilience, social determinants we will have a vital big data set to complement clinical research and work toward the population with DS living long, healthy, and self-determined lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE While lifespan has greatly expanded for people with Down syndrome (DS) in the last seventy years, the population still experiences burdensome morbidities and premature mortality.

"Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients Multiple studies have shown that some patients who remain behaviorally unresponsive after severe brain damage can modulate their brain activity in response to command. A lack of response to the command- following paradigm in other patients, however, cannot be taken as evidence that consciousness is absent. There is thus an urgent need for neuroimaging tools that are able to diagnose covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive subjects without relying on a task. Previous neuroimaging studies of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) have mostly utilized between-state paradigms (e.g., wakefulness vs. sleep) or report-based contrasts, which conflate differences in brain activity supporting consciousness with differences in brain activity supporting behavior or task response. To address these limitations, my sponsor (Dr. Giulio Tononi) has developed a within-state, no-report paradigm that uses serial awakenings to contrast states of consciousness versus unconsciousness during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. Using high density electroencephalography (EEG), his group has shown that the occurrence of dreaming consciousness during sleep is associated with a reduction of delta activity (sleep slow waves) in a posterior cortical ‘hot zone’ encompassing occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. To proceed towards clinical applications, it is now essential to confirm and extend these findings using combined EEG-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). To this effect, in an important new development, Dr. Tononi and collaborators have recently shown that it is possible to faithfully track EEG slow wave activity during sleep by means of a high-frequency (~0.17 Hz) blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation evident in fMRI. This finding provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the NCCs during sleep with high spatial resolution, avoiding potential pitfalls of EEG source modeling, and with unrestricted access to subcortical structures. Taking advantage of these new findings, in this project, I propose to combine the novel fMRI signature of sleep slow waves with a serial awakenings paradigm to locate the NCCs during sleep. Specifically, I will acquire fMRI-EEG data during ~1,080 awakenings from sleep across 40 healthy subjects and investigate the neural correlates of the presence versus absence of dreaming consciousness (Aim 1). I hypothesize that high-frequency BOLD oscillation—which tracks sleep slow-waves—will show regional decreases in specific posterior cortical areas during dreaming compared to dreamless sleep. In Aim 2, I will use univariate and multivariate modeling approaches based on high-frequency BOLD power and conventional BOLD amplitude to identify the NCCs of specific dream contents (e.g., presence of faces) and complexity. If successful, the proposed experiments will constitute an important step forward in identifying brain regions that sustain consciousness and its contents during behaviorally unresponsive states. These results can open new avenues to improve clinical care in patients with a DOC and inform the assessment of intraoperative awareness in anesthetized subjects. Due to previous methodological oversights that confounded consciousness and behavior, the neural substrates of covert consciousness in unresponsive states are poorly understood. The current project will use serial awakenings with dream reports combined with a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of sleep slow waves to identify the neural correlates of both the presence of consciousness and its contents during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. The goal is to help clarify a scientific controversy surrounding the neural basis of consciousness at an unprecedented spatial resolution and with an access to subcortical structures, which could ultimately to improve diagnosis through neuroimaging and clinical care for patients with disorders of consciousness.",Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients,10420051,F32NS114034,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Consciousness Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fellowship ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' selective attention ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Funding ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Vegetative States ', ' Brain region ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Board Certification ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' non rapid eye movement ', ' NREM ', ' non-REM ', ' non-rapid eye movement ', ' nonREM ', ' nonrapid eye movement ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' brain research ', ' cognitive control ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' stimulus processing ', ' fusiform face area ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' clinical care ', ' life-sustaining therapy ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' neural correlate ', ' sensory input ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography ', ' fMRI/EEG ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2021,32997,WI-02
