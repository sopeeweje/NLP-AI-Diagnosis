"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,10135919,K01DK114383,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Belief ', ' Birth Certificates

"Imaging biomarkers of severe respiratory infections in premature infants Phase II ABSTRACT  Prematurity is the largest single cause of death in children under five in the world and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the top cause of hospitalization and mortality in premature infants. Clinical tools to predict the risk and assess the severity of LRTI in premature babies are critically needed to allow early interventions to decrease the high morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Our goal is to improve clinical practice by developing an objective framework to predict the risk and assess the severity of respiratory disease in premature babies using non-invasive low-radiation X-ray imaging biomarkers and clinical parameters.  In the Phase I of this project, our multidisciplinary team of pulmonologists, neonatologists and imaging and machine learning specialists developed an imaging software technology called Lung Aeration and Irregular opacities Radiological analyzer (LungAIR). Our accomplishments include: 1) establishing a curated ground truth of focal findings in chest X-Ray (CXR) of premature babies; 2) developing a machine learning algorithm to automatically localize and quantify CXR-based prematurity lung disease signatures (fibrosis/interstitial opacities, cystic changes and hyperinflation); 3) creating a graphical user interface for clinical deployment; and 4) evaluating our imaging software technology in an independent cohort. We also demonstrated that the imaging biomarkers obtained by LungAIR correlate strongly with the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)—the most common respiratory complication of prematurity-- and the cumulative exposure to supplemental O2 and mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (p<0.001). Importantly, our preliminary results indicated that the combination of imaging and clinical markers (BPD severity) provide an accurate predictive model for LRTI-related complications in the first year of life (AUC=74, p<0.01).  This Phase II project builds on the findings and methodology developed in Phase I. In Specific Aim 1, we will incorporate a model of lung disease risk factors in LungAIR platform. Our software will ingest respiratory support information daily during NICU hospitalization and integrate the data with CXR analysis. In Specific Aim 2, we will extend LungAIR to perform longitudinal analyses during hospitalization with the potential to accelerate the prediction of health risks. We will also integrate our results with the electronic health record of the patient for improve the clinical workflow. In Specific Aim 3 we will conduct a clinical study to prospectively evaluate the LungAIR clinical platform functionality. The proposal includes the business model and a path to commercializing LungAIR. The early identification of premature babies at high risk for BPD and severe LRTI should improve their outcome, reduce hospitalization times and inherent clinical costs, and decrease infant mortality. In addition, the ability to objectively quantify and track lung imaging biomarkers will also guide therapy and clinical trials, as well as improve the longitudinal monitoring of infants.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,10224154,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Future Generations ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' abused drug ', ' abused drugs ', ' drug abused ', ' drugs abused ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' learning ability ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,689816,NC-04
"Leveraging artificial intelligence to develop novel tools for studying infant brain development PROJECT SUMMARY. The first 24-months of human life are dynamic, characterized by rapid growth, and increasingly recognized as crucial for establishing cognitive abilities and behaviors that last a lifetime. However, little is known about trajectories of structural and functional brain development during this sensitive period in typically developing infants, and even less is known about how deviations in these trajectories relate to emerging cognition and behavior or predict later developmental outcomes. This is partially due to current technical limitations on quantification of brain structure and function in infants via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – an important, non-invasive approach to the study of developmental neuroscience. Currently there are insufficient methods to analyze infant MRI scans across the first 24 months of life, especially for brain segmentation – the first and critical step for virtually all quantitative analyses across MRI modalities. Without accurate and automated segmentation, infant MRI analysis is prone to systematic errors and is labor-intensive, limiting the rigor and reproducibility of infant MRI research. This limitation curtails and delays the utility of large-scale infant MRI datasets in the foreseeable future. Addressing these research gaps would significantly advance efforts toward early identification of developmental delays and/or disorders. I propose developing AI-based infant neuroimaging analysis tools for studying the early human brain development via two large-scale datasets: the NIH funded Baby Connectome Project and a centralized MRI data repository from Environmental Influence on Child Health Outcomes. In my pilot studies, I have shown the show good-to-excellent agreement with ground-truth labels from two different sources, and superior performance compared to other commonly used segmentation methods. My first aim is to develop an automated and generalizable brain segmentation pipeline with 3D convolutional neural networks – an AI approach. This segmentation tool can accommodate and process infant brain scans spanning each month over the first 2 years of life. The final AI-based pipeline will be rigorously validated internally, and tested externally. We will release the pipeline as a user-friendly, web-based interface for researchers to use in scientific community. In Aim 2, I will delineate the growth trajectories of regional brain morphometrics, major functional networks, and measure their relationships to neuropsychological functions during the first 24months of life via data from BCP. In Aim 3, I will leverage two different approaches (AI and LPCA) to predict the developmental outcomes assessed up to 3 years old. with the first-year longitudinal multimodal MRI scans from BCP. The interdisciplinary training phase of the award, conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Posner at Columbia University, includes a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of technical and professional skills that will enable my transition to research independence. The successful completion of this project will yield reliable tools and novel data-driven methods for studying early brain developmental, fill critical knowledge gaps of early development, and advance efforts toward early identification of developmental delays and disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Little is known about the growth trajectories of brain development across the first 24-months of life because of insufficient approaches to analyze infant MRI scans especially brain segmentation. This proposal leverages artificial intelligence and large-scale datasets to address unmet technical challenges in infant brain segmentation, to delineate the growth trajectories of brain structure/function and measure their relationship with neuropsychological functions, and to predict the developmental outcomes.

"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,10065509,R44HD095783,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alberta province ', ' Alberta ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Developmental Coordination Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Standardization ', ' Supination ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' portability ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' infant outcome ', ' service intervention ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' motor function improvement ', ' improved motor function ', ' cognitive performance ', ' spatial memory ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' learning network ', ' social engagement ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' early screening ', ' deep learning ', ' Well Child Visits ', ' screening services ', ' ']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2021,605422,WA-07
"Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Data to a Predictive Model of Neuroblastoma Project Summary There is currently no diagnostic tool to accurately predict pediatric neuroblastoma disease outcome that is based on the mechanistic nature of the disease and genomic information of a child’s tumor. Neuroblastoma is a solid, cancerous tumor of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that accounts for half of all cancers in infants younger than 1 year. Uncertainties in the trajectory of disease progression has led to aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments that often result in long-term developmental disabilities for children. Determination of the critical drivers of neuroblastoma initiation and assessment of their interactions for an individual child would help target chemotherapy and limit over-treatment, possibly resulting in an increased quality of life and infant survival. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) and use genomic input from a child’s tumor to test its predictive strengths to predict disease progression, identify critical disease drivers and compare results to current clinical statistical-based algorithms. PredictNeuroB is based on the network interactions of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) developmental signals and is supported by our discovery of a critical role for trkB and its ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during SNS development. Our published model’s prediction of early stage neuroblastoma (for infants 0-2yrs old) using genomic information of 77 children is more accurate than any current clinical prognostic (Kasemeier-Kulesa et al., 2018). In this study, we propose to strengthen the predictive capability of our model for a broader class of patient data (age, stage of disease, chromosome status, MYCN amplification) by applying Gabriella Miller Kids First neuroblastoma databases. Further, we will perform in silico perturbations of the algorithm to determine critical drivers capable of altering neuroblastoma outcome states. At the conclusion of our study, by using a larger set of patient-derived data with associated clinical and disease outcome information, we expect our PredictNeuroB model will prove highly predictive for a broad class of neuroblastoma patients and support clinical decision making in disease treatment and targeted drug therapies. Project Narrative Neuroblastoma accounts for half of all childhood cancers in infants younger than 1 year, yet there is no diagnostic tool to accurately predict disease progression and outcome. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) that is based on the developmental signaling network from which neuroblastoma originates and test its capability to more precisely predict disease outcome using a child’s genomic information as input. By leveraging the information in Gabriella Miller Kids First databases we will test PredictNeuroB for a broader class of children than available in published academic data, resulting in a precise and personalized prognostic tool with the possibility to increase infant quality of life and survival by limiting over-treatment and targeting chemotherapy.",Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,10197069,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"Harmonizing and Archiving of Large-scale Infant Neuroimaging Data Project Abstract The first postnatal years are an exceptionally dynamic and critical period of structural and functional development of the human brain. Many neurodevelopmental disorders are the consequence of abnormal brain development during this stage. Several NIH-funded studies have recently acquired and released large-scale infant brain MRI datasets in the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA), leading to over 3,000 publically-available infant MRI scans from multiple imaging sites. Joint analysis of these big data of infant brains will undoubtedly improve our limited understanding of normative early brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders with boosted statistical power and reproducibility. However, the processed and harmonized data of these multi-site infant MR images still remain publically absent, due to the challenges in processing and analyzing infant MR images, which typically exhibit extremely low tissue contrast, large within-tissue intensity variations, and regionally-heterogeneous dynamic changes. To address this critical issue, the goal of this project is to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant MRI datasets to significantly advance early brain development studies, by taking advantage of our infant-tailored computational tools and further developing advanced machine learning techniques. In Aim 1, we will extensively process large-scale infant MRI datasets by adopting our established and recently-improved infant- dedicated cortical surface-based computational tools and further develop a deep spherical neural network for quality control of produced cortical property maps. This will lead to quality-ensured vertex-wise maps of multiple biologically-distinct cortical properties, e.g., cortical thickness, surface area, myelin content, sulcal depth, local gyrification, curvature and diffusivity. In Aim 2, to remove site effects associated with different scanners and imaging protocols and meanwhile preserve biological associations, we will harmonize the computed cortical property maps from multi-site data in Aim 1 by leveraging our surface-to-surface cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (S2SGAN) based on the spherical U-Net, without requiring traveling subjects (paired data) across sites. To further increase the efficiency and learn more robust feature representation in the whole multi- site data, we propose to extend S2SGAN to jointly harmonize all multi-site cortical property maps using a single generator. In Aim 3, leveraging the informative growth patterns and gradient information of the harmonized maps of multiple cortical properties in Aim 2, we will discover distinct cortical regions, by capitalizing on multi-view nonnegative matrix factorization in a data-driven manner, without making any assumption on the parametric forms of growth patterns. All our processed data, results, computational tools, and source codes will be deposited into NDA, NITRC, and GitHub to significantly accelerate the pace of early brain development studies. Project Narrative This project aims to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover, and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant neuroimaging data, by taking advantage of our pioneered infant-tailored computational tools and developing advanced machine learning techniques.

"Situation Awareness to Improve Infant Sepsis Recognition in the Presence of Clinical Uncertainty PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis has higher mortality in infants than other pediatric age groups, is associated with severe long- term morbidities in 30-50% of survivors, and burdens healthcare resources with prolonged hospitalization and complex interventions. Rapid identification of sepsis and timely initiation of antimicrobial therapy are critical to improve infant outcomes. However, limitations to current diagnostic approaches include the heterogeneous, subtle clinical presentation of infants and limited accuracy of laboratory tests. There is therefore an urgent need for strategies to improve the early detection of sepsis in infants to improve outcomes. Our objective is to improve sepsis recognition by developing an infant sepsis early recognition system that combines patient data with predictive model outputs to deliver timely, precise and relevant information to clinicians and nurses. Our hypothesis is that the integration of a predictive model with clinical data displays that improve situation awareness will improve timely sepsis recognition and management. We will utilize the strong foundation of our preliminary work in predictive modeling and existing data from our neonatal sepsis registry to produce novel methods to identify infants at greatest risk for neonatal sepsis. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from the disciplines of data science, clinical informatics, neonatology, and sepsis/infectious disease research to provide expert consensus recommendations. At the conclusion of the proposed work, we will have developed methods that support the integration of clinical data and machine learning outputs into decision support tools suited to clinical workflows. We anticipate such systems that pair advanced prediction methods with user-centered design processes will have broad applicability to many conditions and populations. This work will form the foundation for a future clinical trial to evaluate its ability to identify infants at highest risk of sepsis and provide clinicians and nurses with the decision support needed to improve their health and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE The rapid diagnosis of bacterial sepsis and timely initiation of antibiotics is crucial for reducing neonatal mortality and improving morbidity. However, subtle clinical signs and inaccurate laboratory tests make rapid diagnosis especially difficult in infants.

"Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants. Project Summary Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) has revealed two major principles of the functional organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in human adults. First, some regions of VTC respond selectively to a specific category of stimuli, such as the fusiform face area (FFA) which responds more to faces than to any other stimulus category. The second principle of organization is that different categories of stimuli have systematically distinct patterns of response across the entire VTC. How do these two key aspects of VTC functional organization in adults arise in development? The goal of my research program is to discover if these organizing principles are present in the infant brain (Aims 1 and 2) and design computational models to test different theories of cortical development (Aim 3). The dissertation work in this proposal will provide invaluable data toward the goal of refining theories of cortical development. In addition to innovations that enhance the quality of awake infant fMRI data, Aim 1 provides the first evidence that like adults, infants have face-selective responses in the FFA, scene-selective responses in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and body-selective responses in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Aim 2 directly follows this up by asking if infants have systematically distinct patterns of response across higher- level visual areas that are similar to those found in the adult brain. The F99 phase of this proposal will provide training to optimize machine learning (ML) techniques that can withstand the unique challenges of infant fMRI data – specifically unbalanced and missing data. The F99 phase will be conducted at MIT, an intellectual environment with access to leaders in the fields of ML, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Finally, Aim 3 of this proposal is to build computational models designed to test current theories of cortical development. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide training on the design and implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models as well as training on the best methods to test ANN models using infant fMRI data. Research for the K00 phase will provide a new mentorship experience with an established investigator in computational neuroscience and will take place at an institution with a thriving intellectual environment that has access to an MRI scanner and the computational resources necessary to build a variety of ANN models. In summary, the objective of the proposed research is to determine if the principles of functional organization in the adult brain are present in infants. Insights from this proposal will advance and refine theories of cortical development and have the potential to be applicable to other domains such audition and language. Further, by combining my predoctoral training in awake infant fMRI with my proposed postdoctoral training in computational modeling, the proposed research will enable me to become an independent investigator and leader in the field of computational developmental neuroscience. Project Narrative The last 20 years of cognitive neuroscience has revealed the functional architecture of the human brain with an exquisite degree of detail yet has left wide-open the question of what guides the precise development, organization, and structure of the human mind. This proposal outlines a plan to unify developmental cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive neuroscience to uncover the starting state of the human visual system and how it develops. The proposed research stands to not only inform and refine theories of cortical development and inform our understanding of neurodevelopmental differences, but also has the potential to begin to unravel one of the most intriguing questions available to humanity: what are the origins of the human mind?",Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants.,10319402,F99NS124175,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' object recognition ', ' Categories ', ' technological innovation ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' response ', ' social cognition ', ' theories ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' model design ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' vision development ', ' visual development ', ' visual system development ', ' Population ', ' extrastriate ', ' Mind ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' fusiform face area ', ' learning community ', ' social engagement ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F99,2021,47036,MA-07
"Predicting the developmental trajectories of cognitive and motor dimensions from preterm neonatal vocalizations Summary One in every 10 babies is born prematurely in the US, and this contributes to high rates of long-term negative health consequences. An even higher rate of preterm births is expected in the near future due to maternal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. While premature birth does not necessarily result in developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, it is associated with elevated rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)1-9, intellectual disability10, 11, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)2, 12, learning disabilities13, cerebral palsy13, and delays in cognitive, social, and motor development2, 4, 8, 10, 14-16. The developmental risks and uncertainty associated with premature birth may overwhelm caregivers with confusion, stress, and anxiety about the future. Moreover, the heterogeneity of cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories among preterm infants confounds the accurate, early detection of developmental issues and the early implementation of therapeutic interventions17-21. As some forms of early intervention improve the prognoses of infants with (or at high risk of) developmental neuropsychiatric disorders22-28, an objective, quantitative method of predicting (or improving the prediction of) the developmental trajectories of preterm infants is urgently needed. A number of research groups have attempted to use computational models to differentiate the cries of preterm and term infants29-32. However, computational models that can predict the heterogeneous cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories among preterm infants do not exist. Moreover, the neural basis of how preterm birth alters the cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories is poorly understood. Based on our preliminary data, which showed that the volume of the amygdala is selectively impacted by a gene variant that is linked to social deficits in mice, we hypothesize that preterm birth also alters the cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories from the neonatal to early adult periods via variable alterations of brain structures relevant to cognitive, social, and motor capacities. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage our expertise in computational feature selection, using variables of neonatal vocalization and volumes of various mouse brain regions that best account for variances in cognitive, social, and motor capacities. A positive outcome will provide much-needed predictive models to further explore the mechanistic bases of cognitive, social, and motor development in mouse models. This should enable investigators to further evaluate the mechanistic, structural bases for heterogeneous cognitive, social, and motor trajectories in preclinical models of environmental and genetic risk factors. Project Narrative Not all babies exposed to prenatal trauma exhibit delays in cognitive, social, and motor development, but there are no reliable means to predict their heterogeneous developmental trajectories. We put forth a proposal to test the hypothesis that preterm birth impacts the cognitive, social, and motor developmental trajectories from the neonatal period to the early adult period via altered distinct brain structures. A positive outcome will provide a much-needed tool that will allow researchers to explore the mechanisms of heterogeneous developmental delay and test the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in a preterm birth mouse model.",Predicting the developmental trajectories of cognitive and motor dimensions from preterm neonatal vocalizations,10315460,R21HD105287,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Heterozygote ', ' heterozygosity ', ' Incentives ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' vocalization ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' coisogenic ', ' brain volume ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Cognitive ', ' 16p11.2 ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' high risk ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' neonatal period ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' feature extraction ', ' feature selection ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' SARS-CoV-2 infection ', ' COVID-19 infection ', ' COVID19 infection ', ' SARS-CoV2 infection ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 infection ', ' infected with COVID-19 ', ' infected with COVID19 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' infected with SARS-CoV2 ', ' infected with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R21,2021,240336,TX-21
"Rosie the Chatbot: Leveraging Automated and Personalized Health Information Communication to Reduce Disparities in Maternal and Child Health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal has the potential to alter the way health information is presented to vulnerable populations. Our proposal promotes a more flexible and tailored approach to reach underserved groups. Racial/ethnic minority women are at increased risk for postpartum depression, and their children as less likely to have had well-child checkups in the past year. Moreover, racial/ethnic disparities are still prevalent for maternal and infant mortality as well as various health behaviors such as safe sleep practices, breastfeeding, and infant nutrition. Currently, some popular programs involve resource-intensive home visits (limited in scale due to staff and cost constraints) or non-personalized text messages (may not directly address an individual’s questions). We propose the development of a chatbot that addresses both of these possible limitations by representing a scalable tool that can have widespread reach across geographies and is personalized and responsive to an individual’s specific informational needs. We have built a prototype of the chatbot, Rosie, capable of engaging in live question-and-answer sessions. Rosie is able to respond to 334 popular questions that new mothers may have. Pretests with mother groups and Mary’s Center patients have showed a positive reception to the chatbot. Over the course of the grant, we will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and the emergence of efforts to aggregate massive amounts of health information, to assemble a comprehensive health information library. We will further refine Rosie’s dialogue analyzer and response inference engine to robustly recognize and respond to user’s questions in the various and complex ways they can phrase a question. We will test the hypothesis that Rosie may lower risk of postpartum depression, decrease emergency room visits, and increase attendance of well-baby visits. We will employ primarily a virtual recruitment strategy to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of this intervention on maternal and infant outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer science, biostatistics, and maternal and child health experts—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop technology for a chatbot, Rosie, that will provide health informational support to vulnerable mothers the moment they need it; 2) Evaluate the use of Rosie on maternal and infant outcomes; and 3) Release an open-source packet for the construction of a chatbot. Rosie provides informational support to vulnerable moms the moment they need it and safeguards new moms from misinformation that is common on the web with the ultimate goal of closing the gap in maternal and infant outcomes. Results and tools developed from this proposal can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Racial/ethnic disparities are still prevalent for maternal and infant outcomes, and popular programs for vulnerable populations involve resource-intensive home visits or non-personalized health information materials.

"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10267180,R01EB029944,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Crowding ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Language ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neonate ', ' feeding ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Neurodevelopmental Problem ', ' Outcome ', ' 5 year old ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical risk ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Structural defect ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' connectome ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification algorithm ', ' public repository ', ' publicly accessible repository ', ' publicly available repository ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Social outcome ', ' prognostic model ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,505593,OH-01
"Developing statistical image analysis tools for non-invasive monitoring of anemia in low birth weight infants Project Summary Our proposal is motivated by the need to develop non-invasive tools for monitoring anemia in very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight < 1,500 grams) and reduce the number of routine painful, invasive blood sampling procedures (phlebotomy) that may alter infant neurodevelopment and behavior. Recently, a new smartphone application [Mannino et al., Nature Communications, 9, 4924 (2018)] that collects and analyzes clinical pallor in patient-sourced fingernail photos and image metadata has been developed to predict hemoglobin levels. The app uses a robust multi-linear regression model that incorporates summary color intensity values (average across pixels) of fingernail photos well as the image metadata generated by the device capturing the image to predict patient's hemoglobin level. While the current app algorithm is simple and easy to implement, there are notable limitations. First, it does not fully leverage the rich spatial information available in fingernail photos by calculating a simple average value. Second, the current algorithm is trained using only adults, whose clinical characteristics are vastly different from infants. The 95% limit of agreement between the app-predicted and blood sample-based hemoglobin level for adults is reported as 2.4 g/dL, which is higher than the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments specification variance of 1.0 g/dL, and will likely increase in VLBW infants given their tiny, non-specific fingernail beds. Such strict error requirements and heterogeneity in populations demand more accurate and tailored algorithms than what the current app employs. Lastly, a framework for applying the app to minimize blood draws across the longitudinal care continuum for VLBW infants is currently lacking. With these considerations, we propose (Aim 1) to develop a new image analysis algorithm (IAA) that produces non-invasive, accurate and stable prediction of hemoglobin level. The IAA will be based on a novel principal component analysis method that provides a non-parametric and parsimonious means to jointly model high- dimensional photos and image metadata, while fully leveraging their spatial structures and co-varying patterns. We will also consider a new partial least squares approach as an alternative method. We will train and validate the IAA based on adult data as well as VLBW infant data. In Aim 2, we will develop a new clustering method to study sub-population structures of fingernail photos and image metadata and study their relationships with the underlying physiological mechanisms of anemia. This approach will allow us to formulate a non-invasive image- based screening tool by identifying clusters of VLBW infants with high anemia risk. In Aim 3, we will develop data-driven tools that leverage longitudinal, patient-level clinical data and IAA predictions to achieve the overarching clinical goal of minimizing the number of blood draws in VLBW infants throughout the care continuum. Our proposal will use the data of VLBW infants monitored at three level III neonatal intensive care units in Atlanta. The proposed methods are generally applicable to a wide variety of settings with diverse and complex modalities of clinical data. Project Narrative Anemia of prematurity occurs in nearly all very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight < 1,500 grams) infants who survive the initial postnatal course, and its main cause is blood loss from routine phlebotomy for its diagnosis. The proposed research project will develop a new image analysis algorithm (IAA) that analyzes full structural information of clinical pallor in fingernail photos to enable accurate, non-invasive prediction of blood hemoglobin level and anemia risk among VLBW infants. We will develop various data-driven tools that leverage longitudinal, patient-specific clinical data and IAA predictions to achieve the overarching clinical goal of minimizing the number of invasive blood sampling procedures throughout the care continuum for VLBW infants.",Developing statistical image analysis tools for non-invasive monitoring of anemia in low birth weight infants,10279575,R01HL159213,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anemia ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complete Blood Count ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hemoglobin concentration result ', ' hemoglobin level ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pallor ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Venous blood sampling ', ' Phlebotomy ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Structure of nail of finger ', ' Finger Nail ', ' Fingernail ', ' Measurement ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' VLBW ', ' very low birth weight ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' postnatal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' inflammatory disease of the intestine ', ' gut inflammation ', ' inflammatory disorder of the intestine ', ' intestinal autoinflammation ', ' intestinal inflammation ', ' infant monitoring ', ' infant measurement ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' postnatal period ', ' post-natal period ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' statistical learning ', ' Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ', ' intestinal injury ', ' injury to the intestines ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,546500,GA-05
"Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning The young child’s ability to regulate stress sets the foundation for a host of developmental outcomes, and the parent-infant relationship is the primary context in which stress regulation capacities first develop. Prior research underscores how parents’ own stress may lead to disturbances in parent-infant co-regulation of stress. Given the immense disruptions to family life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to understand the degree to which COVID-related stress may impact the parent-infant relationship and ultimately infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes. We posit here that (a) maternal stress due to the pandemic will be associated with disturbances in the mother-infant relationship, particularly with respect to mother-infant co- regulation of infant distress and (b) mothers’ experiences of COVID-related stress will have an indirect effect on infant neurobehavioral outcomes, in part, due to disturbances to the mother-infant relationship. We also aim to investigate risk factors (e.g., maternal depressive symptoms, substance use; infant negative emotionality) that might exacerbate such linkages, as well as protective factors (e.g., maternal social support, coping) that may attenuate them. We will partner with six sites from the NIH HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study- Phase 1 (New York University, Oregon Health Sciences University, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute) that will permit addressing the proposed aims among a geographically diverse sample of 240 families with infants between 6 and 18 months of age. To assess key constructs relevant to mother-infant relationship disturbance, we will use a novel multimodal sensing platform that captures infant vocalizations, stress physiology, and motor behavior, and we will employ machine learn approaches to these multimodal data to yield automated assessments of mother-infant co-regulation of infant distress. By combining assessments of (a) mothers’ COVID-related experiences, as well as maternal, family, and infant functioning, collected by the six HBCD sites via maternal reports and virtual visits and (b) mother-infant co-regulation of stress in home environments using remote multimodal sensing technology, the current study will provide unique opportunities for a nuanced and rich understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on infants born during this unprecedented time. Downstream effects of COVID-19 on infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes are likely to be transmitted, in part, through disruptions in the parent-infant relationship due to parents’ heightened stress and poorer mental health. This project will investigate such downstream effects using novel technology and machine learning methods that permit remote assessment of infants and parents in the home. Results from this project may aid in the development of “just-in-time” interventions for parents and infants at risk for relationships disturbance.",Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess
