"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,10131234,R03HD101724,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Boston ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infanticide ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation. We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice. We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes. In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment, and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate, enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current interpretation of screening mammography suffers from human limitations, leading to approximately 30,000 missed cancers and 3.8 million false positives exams every year in the U.S. alone. Our multidisciplinary team of experts on breast cancer screening, machine and deep learning, data science, and imaging technology assessment will validate our highly accurate 2D mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that was the best performer in an international competition with >1,200 participants and then further enhance it with novel AI augmentation methods. We will then apply innovative techniques to scale the AI algorithm from 2D to 3D mammography, addressing the issue of a 50-to-100-fold increase in volumetric data with 3D exams, and then clinically translate our optimized AI 3D mammography tool through a series of interpretive accuracy studies involving experienced and inexperienced radiologists from both academic and community practices.","Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation",10075243,R37CA240403,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computers ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' International ', ' Community Practice ', ' Seminal ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' computer aided detection ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' cloud based ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' Data Science ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' deep learning ', ' long short term memory ', ' algorithm development ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R37,2021,528811,WA-07
"Abramson Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer is the 4th most common cancer diagnosed and the 2nd most common cause of cancer death in the United States. The age-adjusted incidence of CRC in Philadelphia County – a persistently high poverty area– is nearly 25% above the national average. Guideline-based screening for CRC via colonoscopy or fecal immunohistochemistry (FIT) reduces CRC-associated mortality. Despite the proven benefit of regular colonoscopy, CRC screening completion rates remain only around 50% in Philadelphia County and are consistently 10-15% lower for African-Americans than White individuals living in Philadelphia County. Adverse social determinants of health such as high poverty contribute to CRC screening nonadherence disproportionately for African-American and other minority communities. Recognizing this, in 2011, Penn Medicine created a navigation program to increase access to screening colonoscopies for patients in underserved areas of West, South, and Southwest Philadelphia by providing services that reduce barriers to cancer screening, including transportation assistance and detailed instructions on bowel prep. Despite initial success in increasing colonoscopies, a key challenge in scaling this navigation program is identifying patient populations at increased risk of CRC, who may benefit most from timely navigation. Automated machine learning (ML) algorithms based on routine electronic health record (EHR) data accurately estimate a patient’s relative risk of CRC. High-risk individuals may be particularly motivated to comply with disease screening recommendations and be targeted with an effective but resource-constrained navigator program. The overarching goals of this Administrative Supplement is to support the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) mission to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening completion among high-risk individuals living in a persistent poverty county by designing, conducting, disseminating and evaluating an electronic health record- based automated identification program to target effective, culturally-sensitive CRC screening navigation to individuals who have not completed an ordered colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Specifically, the goals of this supplement are to: 1) Adapt a previously validated EHR-based machine learning algorithm to predict CRC detection by retraining the model using data from patients seen in primary care clinics serving zip codes with a high proportion of racial and ethnic minorities living in Philadelphia County, a persistent poverty county; and 2) Implement and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of an algorithm-based CRC navigation program to increase colorectal cancer screening among 344 patients seen at one of 7 primary care practices within Philadelphia county who are at high risk of CRC, have uncompleted colonoscopies. Together, these projects aim to increase evidence-based screening in order to reduce the burden of CRC among high-risk individuals living in a persistent poverty county by utilizing evidence-based, targeted, culturally-sensitive CRC screening navigation that in part addresses social factors that prevent colorectal cancer screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to target an effective colorectal cancer screening initiative towards patients at risk for colorectal cancer who live in areas with persistent poverty, thus increasing guideline-based colorectal cancer screening for a high-risk population through targeted interventions to address social and clinical barriers to screening completion. This research proposal will optimize an automated machine learning algorithm to predict colorectal cancer risk using electronic health record data and an evidence-based navigation program to address poor colorectal cancer screening rates and increase access to screening colonoscopies for patients in underserved areas of West, South, and Southwest Philadelphia by providing services including transportation assistance, detailed instructions on bowel preparation, or mailed fecal immunochemistry tests. The project is relevant to the NCI’s mission by generating fundamental knowledge to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about effective methods to utilize automated electronic health record interventions to increase the frequency and yield of guideline-based cancer screening in order to improve cancer associated outcomes among communities with high and persistent poverty.",Abramson Cancer Center Support Grant,10408409,P30CA016520,"['adenoma ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Immunochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Poverty ', ' Impoverished ', ' Poverty Areas ', ' Impoverished Areas ', ' Impoverished Regions ', ' Poverty Regions ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Relative Risks ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' CRC prevention ', ' colo-rectal cancer prevention ', ' prevent colo-rectal cancer ', ' prevent colorectal cancer ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Colo-rectal Adenoma ', ' Colo-rectal Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colorectal Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Large Bowel Adenoma ', ' Large Bowel Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Large Intestine Adenoma ', ' Colorectal Adenoma ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' minority communities ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' colon cancer screening ', ' colon cancer detection ', ' detect colon cancer ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' adherence rate ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' social factors ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' underserved area ', ' under served area ', ' under served geographic area ', ' under served location ', ' under served region ', ' underserved geographic area ', ' underserved location ', ' underserved region ', ' feasibility testing ', ' transportation access ', ' access to transportation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2021,200000,PA-03
"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naïve and mature screening program. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients,10265504,R01DA051464,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interviewer ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Standardization ', ' Substance Abuse Detection ', ' Drug Abuse Detection ', ' Drug Abuse Screening ', ' Drug Abuse Testing ', ' Substance Abuse Testing ', ' substance abuse screening ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' non-opioid analgesic ', ' non-narcotic analgesic ', ' non-opiate analgesic ', ' non-opioid ', ' non-opioid therapeutics ', ' nonnarcotic analgesics ', ' nonopiate analgesic ', ' nonopioid ', ' nonopioid analgesics ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Source ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Visit ', ' Consult ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Interruption ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' interoperability ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' routine care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' screening ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' prospective test ', ' substance misuse ', ' screening program ', ' clinical decision support ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' unstructured data ', ' comparison intervention ', ' compare intervention ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' substance use treatment ', ' polysubstance use ', ' multiple substance use ', ' multisubstance use ', ' poly substance use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,688326,WI-02
"Noninvasive bladder cancer diagnostics via machine learning analysis of nanoscale surface images of epithelial cells extracted from voided urine samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is common cancer with an estimated 81,190 new cases and 17,240 deaths in 2018 (with > 500,000 survivors) only in the US. The gold standard for diagnosis of bladder cancer includes an invasive optical bladder examination (cystoscopy) and tumor resection for pathology examination. Because of a high recurrence rate of this cancer (50-80%), frequent (once every 3-6-12 months) costly and invasive cystoscopy exams are required to monitor patients for recurrence and/or progression to a more advanced stage. It makes bladder cancer the most expensive cancer to monitor/follow up and treat per patient. Moreover, the invasive nature of the current standard of care, cystoscopy, causes rather low compliance of patient to follow this procedure. There is an urgent unmet need for a bladder cancer screening and monitoring test, which will be noninvasive, rapid, objective, reproducible, easy to perform and interpret, and highly accurate. Such a test will reduce the need in frequent cystoscopies and greatly expand the participation of patients in screening and early detection programs because it decreases the patient discomfort and post-procedural complications.  Here we propose to develop such a test for identification of the presence of bladder cancer and its aggressiveness (grade). It will be based on non-invasive analysis of individual cells extracted from urine (extraction technology already exists in hospitals for voided urine cytology tests, (VUC) the current standard-of- care, a non-invasive examination of cells in urine used to assist with cancer diagnosis and surveillance). A novel modality of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) will be used for nanoscale imaging of cells extracted from urine, mapping/imaging of the physical properties of the cell surface. The collected images will further be analyzed using machine-learning methods and novel advanced statistical approaches to identify a “digital signature” of cancer. The proposed technology is fundamentally different from previously studied urine biomarkers and all existing physical methods because it is based on the analysis of physical properties of the cell surface, not cell bulk or presence of biochemical markers or genetic analysis.  Our strong preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, its presumed superiority compared to the currently used non-invasive methods, and lead us to the central hypothesis that bladder cancer can be identified by analyzing a small number of cells randomly chosen from urine samples, with a low sampling error. This is a substantial departure from VUC tests, which require a visual analysis of many cells. Supported by the preliminary data, we propose (1) to optimize and expand the method, (2) to define the accuracy of cancer detection on a large cohort of patients, and (3) to assess the accuracy of identification of aggressiveness (low versus high grade) of bladder cancer.  Our long-term goal is to develop a non-invasive clinical method for accurate detecting of presence and monitoring bladder cancer as well as many other cancers, in which cells can be extracted from easily accessible bodily fluids without the need for tissue biopsy (e.g urine-bladder & upper urinary tract cancer, stool- colorectal cancer, sputum-aerodigestive cancer, cervical smears-cervical cancer etc.), using methods based on the analysis of physical characteristics of the cell surface. The proposed research, which is the first step in pursuit of this overarching goal. NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel, noninvasive, and sensitive bladder cancer screening test using cells found in voided urine samples that are imaged with ultra-high-resolution atomic force microscopy. The proposed method will improve the current standard-of-care cytological evaluation of voided urine test (VUC) to detect bladder cancer with higher accuracy, and further help to identify the grade of cancer. We anticipate this innovative technology will remarkably improve patient participation for screening and follow-up on bladder cancer, and confidently nominate patients for the more invasive and expensive detection using cystoscopies.",Noninvasive bladder cancer diagnostics via machine learning analysis of nanoscale surface images of epithelial cells extracted from voided urine samples,10276838,R01CA262147,"['Adhesions ', ' Biopsy ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Body Fluids ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Extracts ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cystoscopy ', ' Cytology ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dysuria ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hematuria ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Oncology ', ' Methods ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Sputum ', ' Surface Properties ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urology ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Surface ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical Markers ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Urothelium ', ' Burning Pain ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Atomic Force Microscopy ', ' Force Microscopy ', ' Scanning Force Microscopy ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' physical property ', ' viscoelasticity ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Cell surface ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Malignant Urinary Tract Neoplasm ', ' Urinary Tract Cancer ', ' Urological Cancer ', ' Urologic Cancer ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' cell fixation ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' ultra high resolution ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' clinical implementation ', ' screening participation ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2021,674628,MA-07
"A Software Product That Empowers Individuals Affected By Substance Use Disorders and Their Care Teams with Health and Social Resources Project Summary Access and participation in community resource programs such as transportation, housing and medication assistance - also known as social determinants of health (SDOH) is inextricably linked to a successful treatment and recovery in substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, health and social service providers dedicate a significant amount of time to curate local community resource listings or “referral binders”. These “referral binders” are often highly duplicated and fragmented across organizations and by using expensive non-scalable solutions technology vendors in this domain have not fully addressed this problem. Furthermore, participation in such community programs is also hindered by the absence of highly efficient program eligibility screening tools. Undoubtedly, these shortcomings contribute to lack of direct access to recovery capital for individuals affected by SUD.  We report two feasibility outcomes from our SBIR Phase I study. 1) A novel co-creation led business model that leverages local partnerships with subject matter expertise agencies on SUD and SDOH - can provide enhanced access to community resource programs at the point-of-care. 2) A highly adaptive digital assisted SDOH screening tool powered by novel conversational artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies can enhance patients’ participation in SDOH related community programs. This is achieved by using these technologies to perform program eligibility screenings through both web and text messaging channels coupled with patient triaging within a case work team. The purpose of this Phase II study is to: 1) Optimize and scale the community resource co-creation business model established in Phase I by onboarding eight co-creation partners in Texas within 2 years. 2) Examine the relationship between the conversational AI and NLP powered SDOH screening tool piloted in Phase I with SUD outcomes among youths and young adults. Specifically, we will partner with the Harris Center for Mental Health and IDD - the largest outpatient mental health provider in Texas to examine whether youths screened and enrolled into a treatment program using our technology report improved SUD outcomes. As AI and NLP are core pillars of our technology we will also investigate and subsequently correct for potential societal biases and stereotypes (e.g. race, gender) encoded in such technologies. This effort will avoid such biases to inadvertently determine outcomes in our downstream prediction tasks. The key Phase II milestones include; 1) Demonstrable evidence that the co-creation business model leads to enhanced access to SDOH and SUD community resources at the point-of-care. 2) An understanding on whether screening and eventual participation in a treatment program as supported by our conversational AI technology can lead to reduced encounters with law enforcement including CPS among youths with mental health and SUD. In summary, the proposed Phase II work will lead to enhanced access to SUD recovery capital and facilitate patients’ participation in local health and SDOH community programs. Project Narrative Social factors such as housing, transportation and medication have a significant impact on substance use treatment and recovery outcomes. This Phase II proposal will expand our co-creation model that leverages local community partnerships to curate community resources. In addition, our AI powered digital assisted SDOH screening tool will identify eligible patients and connect them to the services to improve the efficiency of patient screening and intake process.",A Software Product That Empowers Individuals Affected By Substance Use Disorders and Their Care Teams with Health and Social Resources,10360396,R44DA051063,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Capital ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Employment ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Privatization ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Relapse ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Businesses ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' Services ', ' mental health center ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' child protection services ', ' child protective service ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' community-based health ', ' point of care ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Coupled ', ' service utilization ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' social health determinants ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' screening ', ' Patient Triage ', ' community partnership ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' service programs ', ' patient screening ', ' service providers ', ' societal costs ', ' treatment risk ', ' social factors ', ' substance use treatment ', ' ']",NIDA,"MEDICAL INNOVATORS COMPANY, LLC",R44,2021,425535,TX-07
"Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative Technology (AGILITY) Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The AGILITY (Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative TechnologY) trial will assess layered challenges in realizing precision medicine. This includes a limited genetic counseling workforce to facilitate test decisions, and existing inequities in access to genetic testing. To address these challenges, we will conduct a Type1 Hybrid Trial that includes three specific aims. The first aim is to take an existing clinical genetics chatbot and tailor it for use in population screening of gene variants that can lead to Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndromes, Lynch Syndrome, and Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Due to the prevalence of the variants and options for taking actions to reduce negative outcomes, 10 genes have been endorsed for population screening by the National Academy of Medicine and the American College of Medical Genetics. To validate the chatbot for the target population, we will use data from interviews with primary care patients and providers to learn the informational needs to achieve informed test decisions. Once the chatbot is validated, the second aim is to conduct a virtually-implemented randomized controlled trial with primary care patients from a variety of backgrounds. We will test non-inferiority of the chatbot in comparison to standard genetic counseling. We plan to enroll 2,400 adult participants from five racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse primary care clinics at the University of Florida Health System. Patients will be eligible to enroll in the trial if they have no higher risks for the screening conditions. [Those with higher risks will be offered the opportunity to undergo targeted genetic testing as is standard of care, and followed as a descriptive study arm.] Participants will be randomized to learn about testing via a clinical chatbot or a genetic counselor. Our primary outcome is informed choice about undergoing genetic testing. As such, those who decline testing are as informative as those who accept. Secondary outcomes include test-related distress, decisional conflict, and testing uptake. Informed choice will be assessed immediately following the decision, after receipt of results for those who accept testing, and 3 and 6 months later for all participants. To ensure success of the AGILITY Trial, investigators at RTI International will work with the Senior Associate Dean of Research, primary care providers, patients and the community advisory board at the University of Florida Health System to develop recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies. The third aim is to conduct an implementation assessment of the clinical chatbot as an intervention to optimize genetic counseling without compromising informed decision-making and to facilitate population screening. To do so, we will analyze interviews with participants, genetic counselors, and primary care providers participating in the trial, using recognized approaches to inform implementation. The AGILITY study will provide evidence in support of workable solutions to address the critical issue of how to provide robust and scalable genetic counseling around predictive genomics in routine clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE More efficient ways for people to make decisions about having genetic testing are needed. We will compare use of a chatbot to standard genetic counseling in helping healthy adults in a primary care setting make informed choices. If similar, this intervention can expand access to genetic testing to achieve greater equity.",Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative Technology (AGILITY)

"Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis Project Abstract (30 lines of text)  1 Systematic review and evidence mapping, both forms of research synthesis, are formal, sequential processes  2 for identifying, assessing, and integrating the primary scientific literature. These approaches, already  3 cornerstones of evidence-based medicine, have recently gained significant popularity in several other  4 disciplines including environmental, agricultural, and public health research and are increasingly utilized for  5 informed decision making by governmental organizations. It has been estimated that more than 25,000  6 systematic reviews are conducted and published annually and selecting studies for inclusion is one of the most  7 resource intensive steps for any systematic review or evidence map. In Phase I of our research plan, we have  8 developed a web-based, collaborative systematic review web application called SWIFT-Active Screener, an  9 innovative document screening tool that allows users to identify the majority of relevant articles after screening 10 only a fraction of the total number of abstracts. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional 11 research and development required to make SWIFT-Active Screener a commercial success, while also 12 building on and leveraging methods and software we have previously built to address other stages in the 13 systematic review pipeline. Therefore, one of the primary aims of our ongoing research and development is to 14 address this need by expanding the Active Screener application into an integrated platform for research 15 synthesis by uniting it with several of our other related software products. The resulting platform, which we call 16 “swift.ai,” is described in detail in “Aim 1 – Software engineering to create a unified platform for research 17 synthesis.” In “Aim 2 – Improved statistical methods for Active Screener 2.0”, we expand on the methodological 18 research completed during Phase I of this SBIR, to further develop and refine our methods. Specifically, we 19 investigate new ways to integrate state-of-the art methods in deep learning and new ways to better utilize the 20 large amounts of screening data collected from our users in order to improve our models. Finally, in “Aim 3 – 21 Living evidence maps powered by Active Screener 2.0,” we explore new approaches for using machine 22 learning to facilitate evidence mapping. Project narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a unified, web-based, collaborative, systematic review software application that integrates the latest developments in deep-learning, machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis,10259172,R44ES029001,"['Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Problem Formulations ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Testing ', ' Toxicology ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Discipline ', ' Policies ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Review Literature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' systematic review ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' evidence base ', ' public health research ', ' data sharing ', ' screening ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' deep learning ', ' Adoption ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R44,2021,820314,NC-04
"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques.

"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings.

"Development of a program to assess and treat distress in glaucoma patients using an automated EHR-derived AI algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is a disease that results in irreversible blindness and due to its chronic, progressive nature, imposes a psychosocial burden on patients. Appropriately, the focus of ophthalmologists is on controlling the disease to prevent vision loss. Yet, patient’s psychosocial distress during and after therapy has not been routinely addressed and is another important target of care. Psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) negatively impacts all outcomes in glaucoma and is associated with poor follow-up and medication adherence, worse vision-related quality-of-life and disease severity, and faster rates of visual field progression. Direct assessment and treatment of psychosocial distress is likely to improve glaucoma outcomes. While uncommon in glaucoma clinics, psychosocial distress screening has been occurring with some consistency in other medical settings (e.g., oncology) for more than a decade, leading to referrals for intervention and improvements in psychosocial distress and subsequently overall health. Our overarching scientific premise is that a screening program for psychosocial distress (i.e., anxiety, depression) in glaucoma clinics would enhance the patient’s adherence to medical recommendations, and quality-of-life, ultimately leading to improvements in vision-related outcomes (e.g., visual field progression). Patient-reported outcome measures are the gold standard measures of distress, however are not routinely collected in patients with glaucoma due to perceived time and cost burdens. To remedy this, the PI proposes an automated pre-screening framework, motivated by preliminary analyses that demonstrate that distress can be reliably identified using predictive modeling based on glaucoma clinical risk factors from electronic health records (EHR) data. This predictive model will be developed in aim 1 using an existing EHR database, the Duke Glaucoma Registry, and will yield automated risk estimates of distress that can be used to inform clinical decision making, regarding the administration of a distress survey; therefore, limiting distress assessment to a subset of high-risk patients. Secondary aims will focus on external validation of the automated technique, and gauging acceptability to distress screening in a glaucoma clinic (aim 2), and the refinement of a behavioral intervention to improve coping skills for distress in patients with glaucoma (aim 3). This research will positively impact patient well- being in glaucoma, serving as an evidence-based assessment of a distress screening program. The proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of the award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Felipe Medeiros, and multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Tamara Somers (Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences), Dr. David Page (Biostatistics & Bioinformatics), and Dr. Kevin Weinfurt (Population Health Sciences). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will provide the PI with highly sought-after skills and experiences to help ensure a successful transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychosocial distress is a common comorbidity associated with the glaucoma experience and left untreated can contribute to worse outcomes, including worse vision-related quality-of-life and disease severity, faster rates of visual field progression, and poor follow-up and medication adherence, and glaucoma comprehension. The work described in this proposal will introduce and validate an automated assessment and treatment screening program for distress in glaucoma, through innovative predictive modeling of existing healthcare and research database systems. The outcome of this project will shed light on the importance of recognizing distress in the course of glaucoma clinical care, and provide evidence to support new approaches and paradigms to assess and treat glaucoma-induced distress.",Development of a program to assess and treat distress in glaucoma patients using an automated EHR-derived AI algorithm,10282287,K99EY033027,"['Algorithms ', '

"Handheld retinal camera for AI-based diabetic retinopathy screening PROJECT SUMMARY The CDC recommends that each of the 34.2 million patients with diabetes in the United States is screened annually for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a major cause of preventable blindness. Less than 50% of diabetes patients actually follow these guidelines due to lack of access to medical care and eye specialists, time and money constraints, and lack of symptoms with early-stage disease. To address these problems, our team at AI Optics is developing the world’s first artificial intelligence-based handheld retinal camera to allow for point-of-care DR screening. This device is designed to be portable, easy to use, and workflow friendly. It performs high-accuracy DR screenings on non-dilated patients, maintaining optimal security and remaining resilient to connectivity issues. Our goal is that this novel diagnostic device will expand DR screenings beyond the offices of eye specialists and into primary care, optometry offices, diabetes clinics, and retail health settings. This increased access to screening will increase early-stage diagnosis rates and avoid preventable vision loss. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will develop a retinal camera that complies with ISO 10940:2009 standards, which will be able to capture high-quality fundus images in a handheld device. To ensure that full-scale image classification can be conducted, we will also utilize our proprietary, deep-learning artificial intelligence system. Finally, we will ensure that images captured from our retinal camera can be analyzed by our artificial intelligence for the presence of DR. The successful completion of this project will result in an improved and more accessible tool for DR screenings that could lead to earlier DR diagnosis, blindness prevention, and significant cost savings for millions of people with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Less than 50% of the 34.2 million people with diabetes in the United States follow CDC guidelines to get annual screenings for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness that impacts up to 40% of diabetic patients. To address this problem, we propose the development of the world’s first handheld retinal camera that uses artificial intelligence for point-of-care DR screenings in primary care, urgent care, and retail health settings. As it can be operated without an eye specialist or Internet access, this handheld device will be portable, easy to use, and workflow friendly, enabling more screenings, earlier DR diagnosis, vision-loss prevention and significant cost savings for millions.",Handheld retinal camera for AI-based diabetic retinopathy screening,10324087,R43EY032822,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Retina ', ' retina blood vessel structure ', ' Retinal Blood Vessels ', ' Retinal Vessels ', ' Running ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' retinal damage ', ' damage to retina ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' phase II protocol ', ' Point-of-Care Systems ', ' tool ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' handheld device ', ' handheld equipment ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Security ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' Network-based ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' diabetic patient ', ' product development ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' urgent care ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' fundus imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' screening services ', ' ']",NEI,AI OPTICS INC.,R43,2021,299219,NY-12
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10445126,R44EY031202,"['Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Vitamins ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Telemedicine ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' Atrophic AMD ', ' Atrophic age-related macular degeneration ', ' Dry AMD ', ' Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' dry age-related macular degeneration ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Speed ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Supplementation ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' prototype ', ' screening ', ' care costs ', ' Injections ', ' remote screening ', ' ']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2021,108049,NY-05
"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10251254,R01HD102537,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Archives ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' California ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Inborn Errors of Metabolism ', ' Hereditary Metabolic Disorder ', ' inborn metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' newborn screening ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Compound Q ', ' Trichosanthin ', ' alpha-Trichosanthin ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ', ' CFTR ', ' CFTR Protein ', ' cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Trust ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Metabolic ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' genetic diagnosis ', ' genetic disorder diagnosis ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' screening ', ' carrier status ', ' genetic approach ', ' genetic strategy ', ' web-based tool ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' screening panel ', ' screening program ', ' random forest ', ' multi-ethnic ', ' multiethnic ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505339,CT-03
"Autonomous AI to mitigate disparities for diabetic retinopathy screening in youth during and after COVID-19 Project Summary  COVID-19 has led to disruptions and delays in routine pediatric care. For children with diabetes who see their diabetes team every 3 months, this has been reduced or transitioned to telemedicine due to COVID- 19. However, those without technology and internet capabilities, namely low income and minority youth, are less likely to participate in telemedicine and may see their diabetes team less frequently during the pandemic. Screening for diabetes complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), is generally fulfilled by a separate visit to an eye-care professional (ECP), and is also less likely to occur during COVID-19.  Diabetic retinopathy affects 4-15% of youth with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is a leading cause of blindness in adults as early as age 20. Yearly screening for DR is recommended, but only 35-72% of youth undergo screening, with minority youth and children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds less likely to undergo screening. Early detection of DR through screening prevents progression to vision loss. The current standard of care for pediatric DR screening is referral to an ECP for a dilated eye exam. Recently, the FDA approved the first autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) software that interprets retinal images taken with a non-mydriatic fundus camera, providing an immediate result for DR screening at the point of care (POC) for adults with diabetes. In a pilot study at our institution, we were the first to implement this technology in pediatrics, demonstrating safety, effectiveness and equity, and cost-savings to the patient. We also found that minority youth, those with lower household income and Medicaid insurance were less likely to undergo recommended screening, yet were more likely to have DR. This is likely to worsen due to the disparate effects of COVID-19.  We hypothesize that implementing POC autonomous AI in the diabetes care setting will increase DR screening rates in youth with diabetes, mitigate disparities in access to screening, and be cost-effective to the health care system now and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. In this proposal, we will first determine (Aim1) in a randomized control trial at two clinic sites if autonomous AI increases screening compared to ECP, and if those who screen positive by AI are more likely to go for follow-up at the ECP. In the second phase of this proposal (Aim2) we will perform a prospective observational trial of AI screening to determine if AI mitigates disparities in screening, and improves the proportion of at-risk, minority and low income, youth who go for follow-up if their AI screen is positive. In Aim 3, we will use a decision model to determine if AI is cost-effective and cost-savings to the health care system. If AI is shown to increase screening rates while mitigating disparities in access to care, it has the potential to reshape screening methods now and in the future. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes for which children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are recommended to obtain annual screening for diabetic retinopathy. However, adherence rates are suboptimal with only 50% of children obtaining the recommended screening, which is likely to worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for at-risk, minority and low-income, youth who have been disproportionately affected. In this proposal, we aim to implement a new and innovative technology in the diabetes care setting, using a non-mydriatic fundus camera with autonomous artificial intelligence to provide screening and results at the point of care as a means to improve screening rates, mitigate disparities in access to screening and determine cost-effectiveness to the health care system.",Autonomous AI to mitigate

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10320271,R44EY031202,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Color ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Ear ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fees ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incentives ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' New York ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sales ', ' Savings ', ' Smoking ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Vitamins ', ' Specialist ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Java ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' Atrophic AMD ', ' Atrophic age-related macular degeneration ', ' Dry AMD ', ' Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' dry age-related macular degeneration ', ' Trademark ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Visit ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup ', ' checkup examination ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Speed ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Druse ', ' Drusen ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' solar exposure ', ' sun light exposure ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Supplementation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' prospective ', ' user-friendly ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' photobiomodulation ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' screening ', ' Learning Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' software as a service ', ' care costs ', ' Injections ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' remote screening ', ' ']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2021,45000,NY-05
"Optimizing population health outcomes in diabetic retinopathy through personalized and scalable screening strategies Project Summary / Abstract According to the National Eye Institute (NEI), early detection and timely treatment can reduce the risk of severe vision loss from diabetic retinopathy (DR) by 95%. Yet, DR remains the leading cause of blindness among American adults. By 2030, 54.9 million Americans are expected to have diabetes. The prevalence of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) among people with diabetes is 4.4% and 10.2% in the US and worldwide, respectively, representing over 28 million people at risk of blindness. Because DR causes no pain, vision loss, or other symptoms at its early stages and only 50% of people with diabetes receive annual eye exams, many will be unaware of their disease until vision loss is irreversible. Retinal Care Inc. (RCI) believes that the root cause of this public health failure is more behavioral and educational than clinical; complete adherence to screening and treatment would prevent nearly all vision loss from DR. However, 100% adherence is not feasible, practical, or cost-effective. Eliminating blindness from DR requires a strategy shift that acknowledges that preventing vision loss from DR does not require a 100% annual screening rate; it requires only that all patients with VTDR are evaluated by an eye care provider and adhere to follow up recommendations. RCI's approach to cost-effectively eliminating blindness from DR is to prioritize patients who are most likely to require immediate attention and devote the resources necessary to ensure they are evaluated by an eye care provider. The proposed project is designed to accomplish this goal through VTDR risk prediction; targeted patient engagement, education, and behavioral interventions; and optimization of the full system to achieve maximum population benefit. In Aim 1, RCI will leverage our existing Data Repository and machine learning methods to predict VTDR risk using electronic health record (EHR) and healthcare insurance claims data, with the initial goal of correctly placing over 90% of patients with VTDR in the highest-risk half of the population when ordered by risk. In doing so, RCI can focus patient engagement resources on patients who are most likely to need immediate evaluation and treatment, rather than diverting resources to patients who are less likely to require immediate attention. In Aim 2, RCI will use mixed methods framed by the Integrated Behavior Model to identify barriers and motivators for screening and assess their relative importance, develop and implement a survey instrument to elicit willingness to participate in screening based on motivating factors and barrier removal, and use natural language processing to detect barriers and facilitators for diabetic eye screening from patient communications. In Aim 3, RCI will create an agent-based simulation tool to guide care coordination recommendations in a way that maximizes population health outcomes subject to constraints on time and cost. The tool will identify optimal intervention strategies and be adaptable to changes in cost, disease burden, patient preference, population characteristics, and other parameters. Decisions that will be optimized include resource allocation as a function of risk, intervention timing, screening modality, communication strategies, barrier removal strategies, and other modifiable aspects of the system. Project Narrative Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is expected to affect over 11 million people in the US by 2030 and is the leading cause of blindness in American adults, despite vision loss being almost entirely preventable with timely detection and treatment. To prevent blindness from DR, the Retinal Care-DR program is designed to eliminate the deficiencies of the current care delivery model by implementing a first-of-its-kind, personalized care coordination program guided by individual disease risk and population-level outcomes. This will be accomplished through the application of machine learning to prioritize patients for care coordination by disease risk, development of tools to identify and understand the impact of barriers and motivators for diabetic eye screening for high risk patients, and care coordination decision logic guided by agent-based simulation to maximize population health outcomes subject to financial constraints.",Optimizing population health outcomes in diabetic retinopathy through personalized and scalable screening strategies,10324935,R44EY033251,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult

"I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer- related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.  Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.  In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.  In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).  In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1), evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient characteristics (Aim 3). Project Narrative Despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. In this project, we will pilot nudge interventions among older adults – including racial/ethnic minorities, low SES individuals, and other high-risk groups identified using novel analytic methods – and tailor nudges to overcome screening barriers facing these patient groups. We will then conduct a pragmatic, multisite trial evaluating the ability for tailored nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates and reduce disparities in care.",I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges,10238838,R61AG068947,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' mortality ', ' Ohio ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Recommendation ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' discounting ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer-related health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' multi-site trial ', ' multisite trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Data Science ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' intervention cost ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' screening disparities ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2021,294241,PA-03
"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy.

"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health. The tools proposed in this research may provide a low-cost, scalable method to improve detection of cognitive decline.",A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care

"Optimizing Oral Cancer Screening and Precision Management of Potentially Malignant Oral Lesions Project Summary  Despite treatment advances over the past several decades, cancer-specific survival for oral cancers remains bleak, mostly due to the majority of cases being diagnosed at late stages. Early-stage detection of cancers (most often oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)) would enable less disfiguring, less costly therapy with curative intent. However, limitations of traditional visual-tactile examination for oral cancerous and pre- cancerous lesions have hindered cancer detection and support for screening. Visual inspection for separation of benign from precancerous or cancerous lesions is inaccurate, and therefore standard practice entails referral and scalpel biopsy of most potentially malignant oral lesions. Furthermore, approximately 20% of potentially malignant oral lesions contain some degree of epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma, and therefore early identification could allow curative treatment as the majority of OSCC typically starts as dysplasia, and the degree of dysplasia is correlated with the rate of malignant transformation. Detractors of oral screening cite the high prevalence of benign oral lesions and mild dysplasia as circumstances placing patients at risk of harms from over-testing and over-treatment. Thus, screening efforts could be transformed by adjunctive diagnostic tests that offer highly accurate cytopathologic information at the point of care, such as the NIDCR-supported Point-of-Care Oral Cytopathology Tool. Computer vision-assisted precision imaging tests have recently shown strong diagnostic performance for oral lesion characterization, but their potential pitfalls and promises must be thoroughly investigated before clinical application. Similarly, machine learning could bolster optical tests for visualizing potentially malignant lesions. If successful, these artificial intelligence devices could aid decision- making, preventing unnecessary scalpel biopsies for low-risk lesions and enabling risk-stratified surveillance or treatment. Our team of experts in computer disease simulation modeling, machine learning, oral medicine, and economic evaluation will transform a disease simulation model to provide analysis at the point of care, and evaluate the different potential uses of precision imaging diagnostics for translation to clinical care. We will expand our existing disease model of potentially malignant oral lesions to represent lesion characteristics and clinical risk categories (e.g. based on tobacco and alcohol use) through incorporation of large longitudinal datasets (Aim 1), in order to evaluate whether artificial intelligence-assisted cytologic testing can improve the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for low, moderate, or high risk categories (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate whether adjuncts for lesion visualization render favorable effectiveness and cost effectiveness of screening across risk categories, with or without artificial intelligence support, and develop a user interface for the model (Aim 3). This work will produce an analytic engine to guide clinical translation of artificial intelligence- aided diagnostics for oral lesion detection and characterization, to overcome insufficient screening reliability. Project Narrative Early stage oral cancers and precancers are currently under-detected, representing missed opportunity to improve the poor outcomes of oral cancer. While screening with conventional visual-tactile examination is limited in accuracy, artificial intelligence-assisted precision diagnostics could shift the cancer prevention paradigm toward screening for the broader population if enabling reliable triage of oral lesions for risk-based management. The proposed disease simulation model will evaluate the benefits and harms of harnessing these devices and precision treatment thresholds, guiding translation toward cancer control.",Optimizing Oral Cancer Screening and Precision Management of Potentially Malignant Oral Lesions,10298437,R01DE030169,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Consultations ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cytology ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Oral Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oral Medicine ', ' Stomatology ', ' Oral Stage ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Work ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Specialist ', ' oral lesion ', ' mouth lesion ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Caring ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pharynx ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Pharynx ', ' Pharnyx Cancer ', ' Pharyngeal Cancer ', ' Pharynx Cancer ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Malignant -

"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment.

"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10238833,R61AG068951,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Rural Community ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Informatics ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Preventative screening ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer-related health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socio-economic disparity ', ' model building ', ' support tools ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' regression trees ', ' feature selection ', ' screening services ', ' ']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2021,283016,SC-01
