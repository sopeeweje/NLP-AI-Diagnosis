"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for

"Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution The study will address a critical challenge regarding the public health threat of synthetic psychoactive drugs (SPDs): identifying and characterizing how social media is used to market, distribute and sell these products to the public. We will carry out these aims by examining large volumes of data from popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram using an innovative methodology involving machine learning and multidisciplinary data analysis. This research project addresses a key NIDA research objective: “research on factors which influence initiation, continuation and desistance of use of specific SPDs in different populations. Examples include:…market and distribution factors; policies; and the role of peer influences, social media and the internet.” We will first collect large volumes of data filtered for SPD drug diversion, marketing, and drug dealing via social media posts, comments, and other messages. We will then code the data using an advanced machine learning protocol. Finally, we will analyze the data using statistical, geospatial and network analysis to assess associations between SPD marketing and specific risk factors for user groups. We will accomplish these objectives using a multidisciplinary approach that involves disciplines and methods from public health-epidemiology, substance abuse research, computation science, legal and policy analysis, and geospatial analysis. The project has the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Conduct digital surveillance of popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram in order to  describe the nature and magnitude of online marketing, sale and distribution of SPDs;  Aim 2: Characterize the types of marketing strategies used by SPD vendors and drug dealers on these  platforms, including marketing messages used to influence knowledge, attitudes and perceptions  pertaining to SPDs and identification of the users and networks they target;  Aim 3: Using statistical, network and geospatial methods, describe, test, and visualize associations  between SPD marketing and distribution and specific risk factors and user groups. This is a critical opportunity to better understand how social media contributes to a growing “digital” risk environment that can influence user initiation and enable illegal access to SPDs. Though research examining the linkages between social media and substance abuse has been growing, no study has specifically examined online marketing and access characteristics on more than one platform while at the same time assessing how geographic and user network factors can impact this unique and largely unregulated risk environment. Results from this study can generate further study hypotheses on the association between SPD behavioral risk factors and SPD product trends, while also informing future interventions utilizing e-health tools including targeted regulation, health education, and counter-marketing. The emergence of the public health threat of synthetic cannabinoids and other new synthetic psychoactive substances (SPDs) is coinciding with an increase in the use of the Internet and social media to promote substance abuse behavior and illicit access. In response, the proposed project will leverage advanced methods in “big data” analysis to identify and characterize marketing and distribution of SPDs by conducting surveillance of SPD content and messages on Twitter and Instagram. This will be accomplished using an innovative methodology involving advanced machine learning, statistical, geospatial and network analysis.",Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution,10142413,R21DA050689,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fentanyl ', ' Actiq ', ' Duragesic ', ' Fentanest ', ' Fentyl ', ' Phentanyl ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Intelligence ', ' Laws ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Perception ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sales ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vendor ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Discipline ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Policies ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' Prevention ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' prescription medication abuse ', ' prescription drug abuse ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Legal ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' patient advocacy group ', ' digital ', ' Computational Science ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' peer influence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' synthetic cannabinoid ', ' social media ', ' study population ', ' service providers ', ' deep learning ', ' Twitter ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,197344,CA-52
"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.

"Opioid Support and Risk Reduction Online Platform Project Summary  This proposal seeks to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of developing an online support and risk reduction platform to prevent opioid misuse and abuse. This is an urgent area of research; opioid misuse/abuse has reached epidemic proportions in recent years. It is linked to causing the largest drug epidemic in the history of the United States and has become the top priority of the US Surgeon General. Because the opioid crisis (including heroin use) is believed to have largely originated from chronic pain patients' opioid prescriptions, this application will initially focus on the needs of chronic pain patients on opioids who are high risk for addiction and overdose. Later versions of the technology will expand to the broader population of people affected by the opioid crisis, including heroin users.  Although low cost, novel interventions are needed to reduce opioid misuse and abuse, before they lead to addiction and fatal overdose, only 6 behavioral (non-pharmacological) randomized controlled trials have been successfully conducted in this area to date (with our group having conducted one of them), creating a tremendous need for solutions to the opioid crisis. Building off extensive preliminary research that our team conducted, including piloting technology-based behavior change interventions among chronic pain patients, and developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models of opioid outcomes, we propose to design and test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an online peer social support and clinical counseling community to reduce opioid misuse/abuse among chronic pain sufferers.  This is a highly innovative product with scalable commercialization potential and impact as 1) no software platform exists that has been shown to reduce opioid misuse/abuse risk factors, 2) it is evidenced- based, supported by more than a decade of scientific research conducted by our team, and 3) is highly accessible, helping to address the time, cost, and stigma that are constant barriers to opioid prevention and treatment.  Our team includes the former CFO of Epic Systems (and two-time successful entrepreneur), the Associate Chief Medical Information Officer for Cedars-Sinai, a patent attorney at a large Silicon Valley intellectual property firm specializing in digital health portfolios, as well as clinical, data science/statistical, and research experts who conducted more than a decade of formative research leading up to this application. Funding for this Phase 1 SBIR is needed before scaling development and testing more widely among potential health system and insurer customers.

"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem.

"Determinants of inception of inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases Project Summary Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 2 million individuals in the United States and are associated with considerable morbidity. Existing treatments achieve remission in fewer than 50% of patients. Further, despite achieving endoscopic remission, up to 30% of patients with CD or UC will relapse over the subsequent three years. Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to relapse have not been well established. The central premise of our proposal is that despite endoscopic, there exists a local pro-inflammatory microbial milieu and transcriptional profile that favors disease relapse. We hypothesize that current clinical tools do not have sufficient resolution to capture this state. Existing cohorts, by recruiting patients in a heterogeneous state of active inflammation, cannot be used to infer mechanisms of loss of remission and inception of inflammation. A targeted effort that comprehensively and longitudinally profiles a homogeneous cohort of patients in deep remission is essential to define the dynamic relationship between microbial alterations, metabolomic, transcriptional, and proteomic perturbations, and onset of inflammation. Identifying deficient components favoring relapse also allows the development of intervention to replace these deficiencies, thereby extending remission. They will also provide clues and serve as starting points for development of novel therapies. In the first aim, we will recruit 300 patients with IBD in clinical and endoscopic remission and prospectively, systematically follow them for 3 years. We will comprehensively characterize such patients through serial sampling of mucosal and fecal microbiome, serum and fecal metabolome, and proteome in addition to detailed environmental exposure assessment and measurement of drug pharmacokinetics. We will determine the dynamic predictive utility of each of these parameters in defining future relapse from a state of quiescence. In the second aim, we will define the role of pro-inflammatory changes at the cellular level by performing single cell transcriptomic analysis from colonic and ileal biopsies in patients with quiescent CD and UC recruited as above. This will provide important insights into loss of control of inflammation at the tissue level that determines future clinical activity. The final study aim will train and validate a machine-learning predictive model to define the contribution of each additional biologic layer to inception of inflammation and to identify more robust biomarkers of a state of sustained remission. Defining the molecular basis of future relapse in patients in deep remission will provide insights into the ‘pre-disease’ state, allowing for identification of immune pathways of relevance in preventing disease. Defining the fundamental mechanisms through which disease inception occurs from quiescence is critically important to inform key steps in the pathogenesis of these complex diseases, which in turn, will offer opportunities for targeted mechanism-driven interventions to aid durable maintenance of remission and health. The approaches and analyses outlined also have broad applicability to other autoimmune diseases. Project Narrative Despite achieving remission, up to 30% of patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) will relapse over the subsequent 3 years. The mechanisms of sustained remission have not been defined.

"Mapping opioid-dependence state transitions across structural, functional, and transcriptomic topologies PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid addiction is a chronic, progressive disorder that fuels the current US epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Over the years, a tremendous amount of research effort has been devoted to understanding the biological roles of opioid receptors and developing newer generations of synthetic opioids to treat pain and combat opioid addiction. However, given the advancement of contemporary and novel neuroscience technologies, we have the tools to think beyond mu-opioid receptors (MORs) to develop improved OUD therapeutics. This proposal aims to investigate the architecture and function of endogenous MOR-expressing neural circuits in the brain and to determine how these circuits maintain cellular dependence and drive brain-wide maladaptive plasticity across different stages of the OUD cycle. In four complementary aims, we will first map the shifting structural and functional connectivity of opioidergic networks using viral-genetic and tissue clearing methods to identify monosynaptic inputs to withdrawal-active MOR-expressing cells and axonal output projections, as a function of opioid exposure and abstinence. We will then integrate these input/output maps with cell-type information and gene expression changes within dependence networks using hyper-multiplexed 3D in situ hybridizations to generate the anatomic localization of hundreds of dependence-related genes, targeted to cell types and retro- labeled connections. Finally, to reveal how MOR-expressing cells within core regions are modulated during opioid exposure in real-time, we will use miniature head-mounted microscopes to image the population activity— at cellular resolution—across weeks of opioid exposure and withdrawal. Our models will provide formal summaries of activity, connectivity, and gene expression as they evolve with repetitive opioid exposure and withdrawal, and our datasets will be made publicly available as they are generated. To bridge these experimental measurements and provide a common framework for our analyses, we will adopt Network Control Theory to identify brain nodes that drive the transition between opioid dependence states to identify potential candidates that disproportionately drive each state. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since their discovery almost 50 years ago how opioid receptors facilitate the development of dependence and withdrawal at a circuit level is still not known. To address this question, we will chart the global cell-type identity, shifting connectivity, and ensemble activity of opioidergic networks by examining brains throughout various stages of addiction. By leveraging cutting-edge neuroscience technologies, we will map and profile neuronal ensembles and cell-types that mediate opioid action in the rodent brain.","Mapping opioid-dependence state transitions across structural, functional, and transcriptomic topologies",10293782,R01DA054374,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Head ', ' Incidence ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' opioid withdrawal ', ' opiate withdrawal ', ' opioid detox ', ' opioid detoxification ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' mu opioid receptors ', ' μ opioid receptors ', ' μ-OR ', ' μOR ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' Label ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' endogenous opioids ', ' endogenous opiate ', ' Opioid Peptide ', ' Opiate Peptides ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Behavior-Related Disorder ', ' Behavior-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-Related Disorder ', ' Lifestyle-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-related condition ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' virus genetics ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Genomics ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Abstinence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' neuroadaptation ', ' neural adaptation ', ' combat ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' control theory ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' opioid exposure ', ' opiate exposed ', ' opiate exposure ', ' opioid exposed ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' neural network ', ' synthetic opioid ', ' synthetic opiate ', ' Visualization ', ' searchable database ', ' searchable data base ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,516298,PA-03
"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals Project Summary/Abstract This Administrative Supplement proposes the participation of a 3-member team from the Center for Progressive Recovery, LLC (CPR) in the Innovation Corps (I-Corps™), an intensive, 8-week program focused on developing a successful commercialization plan and business model for technology-driven start-ups funded by NIH’s SBIR Phase I mechanism. The program would entail training, as well as structure and accountability around conducting 100 interviews with key stakeholders and others whose expertise would inform the company’s plans. The SBIR Phase I award to CPR (the small business concern, SBC) that this application is predicated on addresses the problem that the people at the greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice- involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for this population are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. We will disrupt system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot. This will be the only tool needed to receive a referral to a bup provider. We will also address low individual motivation with the chatbot by programming it to deliver the efficacious Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) without the need for a trained human. Our aims are: Aim 1: Design and develop a prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (HCD) interviews with key stakeholders; and (b) creation of a chatbot using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) that is integrated with a mobile application; Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to the BNI Chatbot or Digital Resources (i.e., Digitally-delivered OUD and buprenorphine education and referral resources). The following 3-member team has deep expertise in developing and bringing to market digital health solutions and was formed to pursue the unique benefits of the I-Corps program. All 3 are able to meet the time-intensive requirements of the training program: 1) Michael V. Pantalon, Ph.D., CEO; 2) Marianne S. Pantalon, Ph.D., PI, and 3) Thomas Wheeler, Industry Expert and CTO.

"HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract We assess the feasibility of mobile technologies to study the psychophysiological underpinnings of affect in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). In this feasibility pilot study, we will evaluate participants’ adherence to the procedures of a longitudinal study, including: 1. wearing wearable sensors for the duration of the study, 2. completing research activities involving prompted and self-initiated self-reports on momentary experiences of stress and negative affect. We will also examine the validity and reliability of the physiological data captured with two wearable sensors from two different brands and that are placed in different body locations. It is important to assess the reliability of data from two devices simultaneously to examine issues that may hinder a study’s viability, like data noise, signal problems, or data loss, etc. Lastly, we will utilize this data to investigate the role of autonomic function as a valid physiological marker of stress and negative affect in OUD. This has relevant implications in the understanding and development of digital treatments, as stress and negative affect are major contributors of relapse. This pilot work will contribute to the aim 2 of the parent grant by using digital and computational health cores to advance research in mHealth, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition, the work supported under this supplement will serve as a building block to successfully create and submit an F31 grant proposal, a research that will be carried out following the diversity supplement period. This supplement will support the intensive training and invaluable practical experience that will advance the career of the trainee, Veronica Ramirez. This is in alignment with aim 6 of the parent grant to “expand the pipeline for early investigators” and create programs that support “addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship”. Aligned with this, our research can ultimately help current efforts to address the opioid epidemic to ameliorate its detrimental effects on society. Project Narrative This proposal aims to address the complex problem of addiction and the opioid epidemic. This is important due to the cascade of negative impacts on society.

"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someone’s risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention.

"Development and Pilot Testing of a Just in Time Mobile Smoking Cessation Intervention for Persons living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY This application, in direct response to PAR-19-309, will systematically develop and pilot test the Sense2Quit App to improve tobacco cessation in persons living with HIV (PLWH). The prevalence of cigarette smoking among PLWH is more than three times that of the general adult United States (U.S.) population. The high prevalence of cigarette smoking and the high incidence of tobacco-related cancer and other smoking-related diseases among PLWH calls for swift action to intervene to reduce tobacco use rates. However, evidence to guide tobacco cessation in PLWH is inadequate. To address this need, our team proposes to develop, and pilot test the Sense2Quit App, a multi-component smartphone app which provides just-in-time feedback; specifically addresses challenges to tobacco cessation for PLWH: slips, relapses, and difficulties associated with neurocognitive deficits; supports both self-efficacy and decisional balance; and provides quit plan reminders. The artificial intelligence algorithm (validated by our study team) interprets data from a smartwatch to detect smoking hand motions – a technology with more than 98% accuracy in differentiating “lighting up” from other similar motions. The Sense2Quit App leverages smartwatch data and detects when and where smoking activity occurs so that a message can be sent in real time to the participant to help them manage the slip (a puff or two) from becoming a relapse. This just-in-time feedback is critical especially in the first few weeks of a quit attempt. Additionally, Global Positioning System data can help participants avoid triggers (coffee shops, smoking relatives, or friends' homes, etc.). Finally, the Sense2Quit App provides information on how well smokers are progressing through their quit plan, support tips, and motivational tools (i.e., badges related to saving money from not purchasing cigarettes). The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Explore and identify, using qualitative methods, acceptable and appropriate app content and features of the Sense2Quit App to support smoking cessation and relapse prevention in PLWH who smoke; 2) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Sense2Quit App in a sample of 60 PLWH who smoke; and 3) Employ the RE-AIM framework to assess the potential scale-up of the Sense2Quit App. As part of the pilot trial, we will randomize 60 HIV-positive smokers to the Sense2Quit App, standard smoking cessation counseling, and nicotine replacement therapy (active condition) versus standard smoking cessation counseling plus nicotine replacement therapy (control) and examine group differences in rate of quit attempts, 7-day point prevalence abstinence, and sustained abstinence. We will calculate an effect size estimate of the Sense2Quit App to guide, in part, the sample size needed for a larger scale clinical trial. The knowledge gained from the proposed research will enable the scientific community and patients to improve tobacco cessation in those persons who are in most need in the U.S. Given our team's unique and complementary expertise in each of the areas necessary to develop an innovative smoking cessation intervention to improve outcomes among PLWH, we are confident that the findings from this study will be easily scaled-up for further testing to ensure improvement in health outcomes for PLWH. PROJECT NARRATIVE The prevalence of smoking in the general United States population has gradually declined to the lowest rate ever recorded; however, this has not been true for persons living with HIV (PLWH). Therefore, our study team seeks to develop and pilot test Sense2Quit, a tobacco cessation intervention for PLWH. The knowledge gained from this research will enable the scientific community, clinicians, and community stakeholders to improve tobacco cessation outcomes for PLWH.",Development and Pilot Testing of a Just in Time Mobile Smoking Cessation Intervention for Persons living with HIV,10335352,R21CA265961,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Coffee ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geography ', ' Gestures ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best

"Clear Volume Imaging with Machine Learning: a novel tool to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse in rat models This project is in response to PA-18-437 “Cutting-Edge Basic Research Awards (CEBRA)”. Over the two past decades, there has been a large increase in the abuse of prescription and illegal opioids; this increase coincides with increases in opioid-related deaths. A critical challenge is the occurrence of relapse in treated patients, especially given that relapse episodes carry a risk of overdose. There is a need to improve our understanding of the brain mechanisms of opioid relapse, which hopefully will result in the identification of targeted circuitry-based treatments. We propose to develop a high-throughput computation system termed Clear Volume Analysis with Machine Learning (CVA-ML). We will combine CVA-ML with a rat-optimized version of the whole brain immunostaining and clearing method iDISCO+ and a new rat model of opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence to identify brain- wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse. We recently adapted the iDISCO+ method to intact rat brains and developed experimental methods for Fos immunostaining, brain clearing, and light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging. However, incorporation of the iDISCO+ method to large scale rat studies is currently limited by (1) lack of ABA-CCF-comparable high-resolution 3D rat brain atlas that allows for high-resolution registration of the activity signal in the 3D space, and (2) lack of an automated data analysis pipeline. In Aim 1, we propose to develop a data analysis pipeline that will take light sheet fluorescence microscopy- generated rat brain images and automatically register them into a custom-made 3D rat brain atlas encompassing a converted Paxinos and Watson rat’s brain atlas. As part of Aim 1, we also propose to develop machine-learning methods to identify and analyze the whole brain Fos signals in 3D space. In Aim 2, we propose to use the methods we developed in Aim 1 to identify brain-wide patterns of neuronal activity (‘neural ensembles’) that encode opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence induced by imposing adverse consequences (electric barrier) that results in long-term cessation of opioid (oxycodone) self-administration. Our proposal addresses the goal of PA-18-437: “to develop, and/or adapt, revolutionary techniques or methods for addiction research.” The anticipated outcomes of our proposal are an open-source software package to automatically analyze iDISCO+ data of rat brains, and a rat whole brain activity map for opioid relapse, assessed using a new rat model. The publicly available software will be easy to modify and can be used by investigators to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles underlying drug relapse and other motivated behaviors in rats. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop a high-throughput computation system and combine it with the whole brain clearing method iDisco+ and a novel rat model of relapse after voluntary abstinence opioid relapse model to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse.

"RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The research project outlined in this SBIR submission will develop the Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE) platform into a tool to promote sustained recovery in individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder. In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the user’s device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the user’s recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",10356481,R44DA046151,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Foundations ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Industry ', ' Italy ', ' Leadership ', ' Locomotion ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Morbidity -

"NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network In CTN-0076-Ot (Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders in Medical Settings: Pilot Usability Testing in an EMR (COMPUTE)), our team iteratively developed and piloted a web-based and electronic health record (EHR)-integrated Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) on the diagnosis and management of OUD. The OUD-CDS, referred to as Opioid Wizard, was implemented within the EPIC EHR of one large care system and piloted with 55 providers to ensure content validity and provider satisfaction. Through CTN-0095 (COMPUTE 2.0), our team will now implement Opioid Wizard in a large multi-site clinic-randomized controlled trial to evaluate its impact on practice process measures and patient outcomes. We also aim to prepare for scalability (i.e., integration into usual primary care practice after the study is complete) and dissemination by evaluating facilitators and barriers to implementation, determining the costs of implementation and maintenance, and assessing the short-term cost impacts of Opioid Wizard.  The study will include three large diverse care systems and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics to receive Opioid Wizard or usual care (UC). In intervention clinics, Opioid Wizard will identify patients who are at high risk` for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; use data stored in the EHR for each eligible patient to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each patient’s current needs; display these recommendations to PCPs via the Opioid Wizard user interface; and store analytic data from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, Opioid Wizard will run invisibly in the background to identify high-risk or OUD patients, assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each eligible patient’s needs, and store analytic data from all targeted visits. This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction. There is a nearly 80% treatment gap in the use of medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD). Conducting a large-scale trial of Opioid Wizard, an opioid use disorder clinical decision support system for primary care settings, has great potential to increase access to MOUD, and could help reduce the nearly $20 billion in annual healthcare costs related to untreated opioid misuse and OUD.",NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network,10358343,UG1DA040316,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ',

"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",10220922,R01DA046620,"['Buprenorphine ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Naloxone ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Overdose ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' resource guides ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Academic Detailing ', ' Data ', ' Intervention Community Trial ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Sum ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' overdose prevention ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' public health priorities ', ' surveillance data ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' opioid policy ', ' opioid guideline ', ' opioid law ', ' opioid legislation ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' opioid agonist therapy ', ' opioid agonist treatment ', ' referral services ', ' overdose risk ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,807350,RI-01
"Evaluating the impact of e-cigarette social media marketing on e-cigarette use among underage youth. Abstract/Project summary E-cigarettes are a big problem among high school students – with rates of daily use exploding from 12% in 2017 to 28% in 2019. Adolescents are exposed to e-cigarette endorsements from social media influencers who promote these harmful products on behalf of e-cigarette brands as a healthier alternative to conventional cigarettes. This project proposes to comprehensively describe e-cigarette influencer marketing on Instagram (the most widely used platform for e-cigarette influencers) and on other social media platforms popular among U.S. teenagers; to examine associations between exposure to social media marketing and patterns of initiation and change in e-cigarette use; and to explore youth attitudes and ideas related to e-cigarette influencers and e- cigarette prevention campaigns. For Aim 1, we will use innovative, validated deep-learning models - a form of artificial intelligence that automatically discovers patterns in data - to evaluate trends in marketing themes and compliance with federal requirements for warning labels and sponsorship disclosures in e-cigarette promotional images and videos on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok to be collected from 2021 to 2023 (over four million posts, in all). We will use ANOVA tests to examine temporal trends in user engagement with e-cigarette marketing posts and compare the proportion of underaged users among followers of e-cigarette influencers on these platforms over the two-year period. For Aim 2, we will measure the association of exposure to e-cigarette marketing (on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat) with subsequent initiation, escalation or cessation of e-cigarette use among a socioeconomically- and racially-diverse cohort of 5,000 high school students living in urban areas of Southern California via ongoing longitudinal cohort surveys (2021-2023). We will use three waves of survey data in multilevel multinomial logistic regression to measure changes in exposure to- and engagement with e-cigarette marketing on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat; we will use repeated-measures random effects logistic regression models to evaluate the association of exposure to marketing content on these platforms with subsequent changes in e-cigarette use. Ten focus groups among survey participants will complement survey findings and will be analyzed using the Grounded Theory method. Using the social media data, surveys and focus groups, we will also quantify and characterize the level of exposure to- and perception of anti-e-cigarette prevention campaigns on social media. This project will be the first to thoroughly evaluate changes in e-cigarette use habits among youth as a result of exposure to e-cigarette marketing and interaction with e-cigarette influencers on the most popular social media platforms among adolescents. Project Narrative Despite federal regulations, influencers continue to promote e-cigarette products on Instagram and other social media platforms popular among teenagers such as TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat. This will be the first study to comprehensively evaluate user engagement with e-cigarette influencers, changes in youth e-cigarette use resulting from exposure to- and engagement with e-cigarette marketing content, trends in e-cigarette marketing themes, and compliance with federal regulations for e-cigarette warning labels and sponsorship disclosures. Our findings will allow us to inform regulators about the influence of social media promotional strategies on youth susceptibility to e-cigarettes to help design future public health e-cigarette prevention campaigns that can counter e-cigarette marketing.",Evaluating the impact of e-cigarette social media marketing on e-cigarette use among underage youth.,10218998,R01CA260459,"['Advertising ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' ANOVA ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Federal Trade Commission ', ' Federal Trade Commission ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Measures ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' urban location ', ' urban region ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Period Analysis ', ' Period Analyses ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' cigarette warning label ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data sharing ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' vaping ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' social media ', ' Data Analytics ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' secondary analysis ', ' combustible cigarette ', ' conventional cigarette ', ' traditional cigarette ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' deep learning ', ' e-cigarette cessation ', ' e-cig cessation ', ' ecig cessation ', ' quitting e-cigarettes ', ' quitting e-cigs ', ' quitting ecigarettes ', ' quitting ecigs ', ' warning label ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,472796,CA-37
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis. Building a model of relapse risk prediction based on the presence of these cells will enable rapid, accurate, and actionable relapse prediction moving closer to the goal of preventing relapse.",Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10210902,R01CA251858,"['Adoption ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Incidence ', ' leukemia ', ' B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute B-Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' B-ALL ', ' B-Cell  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ', ' Pre-B-Cell Leukemia ', ' Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' acute lymphatic leukemia ', ' acute lymphogenous leukemia ', ' acute lymphomatic leukemia ', ' Medicine ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' Genomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Pediatric Leukemia ', ' children with leukemia ', ' leukemia in children ', ' Childhood Leukemia ', ' SYK ', ' Spleen Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase SYK ', ' SYK gene ', ' CREB ', ' CREB1 ', ' cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein 1 ', ' CREB1 gene ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Leukemic Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Oncogenic ', ' chemotherapy ', ' therapeutic target ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' clinical risk ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' individual patient ', ' prospective test ', ' mutational status ', ' mutation status ', ' relapse prediction ', ' predict relapse ', ' relapse risk ', ' clinical implementation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,615576,CA-18
"Dopamine circuit regulation of morphine reinforcement across the opioid exposure cycle PROJECT SUMMARY Pathological adaptions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine system associated with chronic exposure to opioids and opioid withdrawal can dysregulate responsivity to opioids and contextual cue associations. The primary goal of this training proposal is to gain new skills in advanced computational techniques to delineate how functionally diverse subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons are regulated during morphine exposure and the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice. Foundational findings have identified the intrinsic and synaptic (glutamatergic and GABAergic) adaptations that VTA dopamine neurons undergo throughout acute and chronic opioid exposure. Yet, few studies have accounted for the functional diversity of VTA dopamine neurons that mediate distinct aspects of cue-reward processing and motivation. Dissociating the potential diversity of VTA dopamine responses in the development of opioid dependence will help unravel the neural basis of the progression of opioid-use disorder. The Zweifel lab has previously used a genetic approach to isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of dopamine neurons that project to discrete regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhr1)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons were found to selectively project to the NAc Core (VTACore) and cholecystokinin (Cck)-Cre VTA dopamine neurons selectively project to the NAc medial Shell (VTAmShell). I hypothesize that there exist projection-specific neural and behavioral correlates in response to morphine and during the formation of morphine contextual associations in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice. I will investigate this using a systematic approach across three aims. For Aim 1 (K99), I will use behavioral pharmacology and fiber photometry to determine whether VTACore and VTAmShell dopamine neurons engage in uniform or differential dose-dependent neural activation dynamics in non-dependent and morphine dependent mice. For Aim 2 (K99), I will use my skills in conditioned place preference and in vivo fiber photometry to determine how the VTACore and VTAmShell neurons encode contextual associations to morphine in non-dependent and morphine dependent mice. For Aim 3 (R00), I will determine the basis of these pathological adaptations in VTA dopamine subpopulations by dissecting the role mu-opioid receptor (MOR)- sensitive GABAergic inputs play in morphine contextual associations. During the K99 mentored phase, I will gain new scientific training in Dr. Larry Zweifel’s laboratory, augmented by my advisory committee, in computational analytical tools to analyze complex neurophysiological and behavioral data sets. I will also gain new career development training from Dr. Zweifel, my advisory committee, and the MOSAIC UE5 program that will facilitate my transition into a successful independent principal investigator in academia. Importantly, I will continue my work on increasing representation and equity in the biomedical research workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE The opioid crisis has inflicted a tremendous socioeconomic burden and resulted in the countless loss of lives. In order to further initiatives geared towards resolving the opioid crisis with novel treatments, basic neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie pathological opioid behaviors need to be elucidated. The goal of this proposal is use combinatorial genetic, photometric, electrophysiological, and machine-learning based behavioral analysis to decode the behavioral and neural correlates of the heterogeneous mesolimbic dopamine system that regulate morphine response and associative learning in non-dependent and morphine-dependent mice.",Dopamine circuit regulation of morphine reinforcement

"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying

"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,10098312,R01DA039159,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Future ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Overdose ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Co-ordination disorder ', ' Coordination Disorder ', ' Dyscoordination ', ' Incoordination ', ' Lack of Coordination ', ' Abnormal coordination ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' post intervention ', ' drugged driving ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' motivational intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' brief motivational intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' nonmedical use ', ' non-medical use ', ' public health priorities ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' learning progression ', ' continuous learning ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' recruit ', ' overdose risk ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' comparison intervention ', ' compare intervention ', ' clinical encounter ', ' implementation intervention ', ' implementation facilitators ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,552775,MI-12
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best

"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. This application requests 5 years of funding to support protected research time for Dr. Cavazos to learn and apply new skills in state-of-the-art “big data” analysis and to synthesize her results

"Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder Project Summary: The US is experiencing an opioid crisis, with an estimated 2.5 million Americans meeting full criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for OUD. In spite of the proven efficacy of MOUD, nearly half of people who begin a MOUD relapse within six months. As such, novel and efficacious behavioral adjuncts to MOUD are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a cognitive-affective training intervention generated through a NIDA-funded treatment development process has shown significant promise, demonstrating therapeutic effects in four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by reducing opioid use and misuse and modulating neurophysiological responses during drug cue-reactivity and natural reward processing. However, the MORE intervention requires significant human interaction and is therefore resource intensive. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent to engage in face-to-face interventions due to the risk of viral spread. To overcome these implementation barriers and increase access to treatment, the proposed project will develop and test a virtual reality version of the MORE intervention (MORE-VR) built on BehaVR LLC's VR existing, commercially available platform, the Dynamic eXperience Engine (DXE). The DXE uses machine learning to integrate biometrics into the VR experience to personalize addictions treatment, boosting patient engagement and optimizing the efficacy of clinical intervention. In Phase I, we will develop and test the MORE-VR prototype in a single arm clinical study of OUD patients receiving buprenorphine in an opioid treatment program (OTP), focusing on patient safety and engagement. If the prototype is perceived to have adequate usability and Net Promoter Scores, as well as to produce improvements in proximal measures of craving and affective state, the project will progress to Phase II. In Phase II, we will first develop the MORE-VR Minimal Viable Program using feedback from our Phase I study to optimize the intervention, and then conduct a RCT of MORE-VR vs. MOUD treatment as usual. Our robust and unbiased research design will triangulate clinical outcome measurement with biochemical verification of abstinence, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and neurophysiological assessment of cue-reactivity. Further, we will integrate the MORE-VR Program into the OTP operational environment, building Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces to ingest patient data from electronic medical records (EMRs) and to export patient utilization, assessment, and biometric data back to EMRs to create patient records and inform clinicians of patient progress. Activities in Phase I and Phase II will help define the regulatory pathway and establish regulatory feasibility to precede Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the MORE-VR system as a Class II medical device. In sum, this project will translate an evidence- based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD. Project Narrative Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most effective form of intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD); however, novel behavioral adjuncts are needed to remediate dysregulation in brain reward systems, enhance MOUD adherence, and prevent relapse. BehaVR, LLC will meet this need by translating an evidence-based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD that will increase accessibility to services to improve the patient's chances of long-term treatment success.",Digital Therapeutic Development of Virtual Cognitive-Affective Training for Opioid Use Disorder,10255561,R44DA053848,"['Affect ', ' Back ', '

"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for

"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices.

"Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an administrative supplement to our existing NIDA-funded grant entitled “Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome” (R01DA049755). Every 15 minutes in the United States, an infant is born exposed to opioids, many of which develop the difficult to treat drug withdrawal syndrome, Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS). Unfortunately, the diagnosis of NOWS is highly subjective and includes “high pitched cry” simply based on the nurse’s judgement. The objective measurement of the acoustic characteristics of the cry in babies with NOWS is a pivotal component of the Specific Aims of the active award for this Administrative Supplement entitled “Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome” (R01DA049755): Aim 1: Determine neurobehavioral, cry, prenatal opioid and other substance exposure measured via maternal hair, and sociodemographic predictors of NOWS onset and severity. Aim 2: Evaluate the predictive validity of these clinical markers and test whether NOWS severity predicts neurodevelopment impairment at 6 and 18 months. We developed a computer-based cry analyzer that extracts the acoustic features of an infant’s cry. We used the cry analyzer to determine the acoustic characteristics of the cries of babies with NOWS and developed a NOWS cry “signature” that can identify which babies develop NOWS with a 91% accuracy rate. However, the cry technology that we developed is not usable at the bedside. The Specific Aim of this Administrative Supplement Is to develop a cloud-based system for the automated analysis of infant cry acoustical characteristics for the diagnosis of NOWS. The proposed software will enable us to have a fully automatic system, where a user records a baby cry in the newborn nursery using a phone or other connected device, and within a few seconds, receives the diagnostic result. This Administrative Supplement will provide the cloud-based software to change clinical practice by providing a more accurate and reliable diagnosis of NOWS which will affect the pharmacological treatment of NOWS including length of hospital stay and potentially improve the long-term outcome of these infants. PROJECT NARRATIVE The opioid epidemic has resulted in an alarming increase in the number of newborn babies who suffer drug withdrawal (NOWS or Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome). We will develop a cloud-based software system for the accurate diagnosis of NOWS and improve the management, health and development of these babies.","Clinical markers of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: onset, severity and longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome",10405202,R01DA049755,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Computers ', ' Crying ', ' Diagnosis ', ' gastrointestinal system ', ' Ailmentary System ', ' Alimentary System ', ' Digestive System ', ' Gastrointestinal Body System ', ' Gastrointestinal Organ System ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Judgment ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Manuals ', ' Morphine ', ' Infumorph ', ' Kadian ', ' MS Contin ', ' MSir ', ' Morphia ', ' Oramorph ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Statex SR ', ' Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Substance Withdrawal ', ' Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' newborn abstinence syndrome ', ' Noise ', ' Nurseries ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Nursing Records ', ' Records ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Substance Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Training ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' software systems ', ' fetal opioid exposure ', ' fetal opiate exposures ', ' gestational opiate exposure ', ' gestational opioid exposure ', ' prenatal opiate exposure ', ' prenatal opioid exposure ', ' prenatally opiate exposed ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' infant outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' cloud based ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' application programming interface ', ' application program interface ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' sociodemographic predictors ', ' socio-demographic predictors ', ' ']",NIDA,WOMEN AND INFANTS HOSPITAL-RHODE ISLAND,R01,2021,175593,RI-02
"Non invasive vagal nerve stimulation in opioid use disorders Opioid addiction is a major crisis of epidemic proportions and drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) includes medications with effects on opioid receptors such as buprenorphine, but access is limited for many patients. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that has been shown in recent studies to be equivalent in efficacy to buprenorphine. Initiation of treatment with long-acting naltrexone, however, requires a period of abstinence of about seven days during which time patients suffer from intense symptoms of withdrawal with a risk of relapse that can lead to overdose-related death. Opioids have an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and the sympathetic nervous system, and many symptoms of withdrawal are driven by rebound activation of these systems. Dopaminergic systems in brain areas including ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate) play an important role in opioid addiction, craving and relapse, as do increases in inflammation. This project will assess a form of neuromodulation involving non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that may play a useful role during the period of opioid withdrawal before the initiation of long-term naltrexone treatment in blocking norepinephrine, sympathetic, and inflammatory responses and enhancing peripheral parasympathetic and central brain function in areas modulating drug craving (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate). Our preliminary data on the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on stress response in traumatized human subjects and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show that nVNS reliably blocks peripheral sympathetic and enhances parasympathetic function, reduces inflammatory responses (interleukin-6, or IL-6), and enhances central brain responses (anterior cingulate) to stress. We now propose to apply this technology to the treatment of patients with OUDs. Following verification using modelling and determination of optimal dosing parameters, we will use these parameters to assess effects of nVNS versus sham stimulation on opioid craving, peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and brain functional responses measured with High-Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water to videos of drug cues in recently treated patients with OUDs. Based on the outcome of this research, we will proceed to the UH3 phase, which will involve a randomized, sham-controlled trial of nVNS in patients with OUDs during the one to two week period of opioid withdrawal followed by assessment of craving, HR-PET imaging of both brain function and brain dopaminergic function, and assessment of peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in conjunction with administration of nVNS or sham. We hypothesize that nVNS will reduce opioid craving and inflammatory, peripheral autonomic and cardiovascular responses and enhance brain responses (anterior cingulate function and dopamine function in ventral striatum), and promote successful conversion to long-acting naltrexone, in patients with OUDs. Project Narrative Opioid use disorders (OUDs) have been associated with a 4-fold increase in drug overdose deaths in the past decade, and current treatments including medications that block the opioid receptor require a withdrawal period during which time many patients relapse and tragically may overdose and die. This project will assess a new device, non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS), that does not require surgery or implantation, and that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve as it passes through the neck, dampening the sympathetic nervous system and modulating brain regions in a way that may help patients during the opioid withdrawal period and reduce relapse. Studying the effects of nVNS on opioid craving and brain and physiological responses in patients with OUDs has the potential to reduce relapse and save lives, as well as increase our knowledge of changes to the brain and physiology that underlie OUDs and successful response to treatment.",Non invasive vagal nerve stimulation in opioid use disorders,10376890,UG3DA048502,"['Brain ', ' Brain

"Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Suicide rates have nearly doubled among adolescent girls over the past decade. During this same time period, social media sites (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook) have become ubiquitous, with nearly 97% of youth now using social media. Social media offers both risks and benefits for adolescent development. However, there is likely a vulnerable subset of youth for whom social media use influences suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). The primary goal of this study is to examine how and for whom social media use contributes risk for STBs, so that we may better identify and intervene with youth most at risk. A multi-method approach, integrating computational psychiatry and experimental techniques, will be used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which social media use affects STBs. Data will be collected from both an existing dataset (n ~ 2,000) and a recruited sample (n = 90 adolescent females, ages 14-17, with lifetime history of STBs). To identify specific, directly observable social media experiences that heighten risk for STBs, digital trace data (i.e., social media content and meta-data) will be collected directly from adolescents’ social media pages and analyzed using machine learning techniques. In addition, an innovative laboratory paradigm with eye- tracking/pupillometry will be used to examine cognitive and affective responses to social media use that increase vulnerability to STBs. Participant STBs will be assessed at baseline, 3-month-, and 6-month follow ups. The aims of the study are well-aligned with the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of adolescent social media use and mental health. To purse this research agenda going forward, the candidate proposes training in four key areas: (1) machine learning methods for analyzing digital trace data, (2) experimental eye tracking/pupillometry paradigms, (3) mechanism-based translational research in adolescent suicide risk, and (4) professional development, with an emphasis on training in effective interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethics of social media research. A team of mentors and consultants from multiple disciplines will facilitate the candidate’s training, including experts in youth suicide risk, machine learning and natural language processing, and experimental peer interaction paradigms. The diverse resources available at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will ensure successful completion of the project and foster the development of the candidate’s research program. The proposed study has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of social media in adolescent suicide risk. Completion of the proposed research and training goals will uniquely position the candidate to become a leader in the field of adolescent social media use. Project Narrative Nearly all adolescents use social media sites, yet for a vulnerable subset of teens, social media use may increase risk for suicide. Given rising suicide rates among adolescent girls in recent years, it is critical to examine the reasons why social media use may be related to suicidal thoughts and attempts. Findings of this study will have the potential to inform future suicide intervention and prevention efforts that address the unique needs of adolescents in the digital age.",Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents,10217967,K23MH122669,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Disclosure ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Ensure ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' gaze ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' career development ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' digital ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Affective ', ' web interface ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' Facebook ', ' Twitter ', ' learning classifier ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K23,2021,195696,RI-01
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder. The results of this project are expected to inform multilevel interventions equitably deliver treatment for opioid use disorder, ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders, and reduce health disparities.",Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis,10190881,K99DA051534,"['Affect ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Critical Care ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' mortality ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' forest ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' electronic data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' standard of care ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' data warehouse ', ' multiple data sources ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' substance use treatment ', ' black patient ', ' ']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,179582,CA-18
"Opioid effects on cognition and addiction: Molecular underpinnings Project Summary Opioid overdoses kill more than 130 Americans every day, yielding over 47,500 deaths per year, and the same number of deaths in the 9/11 attacks every 23 days. The best treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) are medication-assisted therapies such as methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone, and are inadequate to buttress the epidemic. Failure to treat OUD is sourced in not understanding the molecular pathophysiology of OUD, including its clinical manifestations as a biological, psychological, and behavioral disease, the neurobiological mechanisms that reinforce its consumption, and how repeated consumption affects other neurocognitive processes. The Hurd lab recently discovered a genomic locus associated with OUD, downstream of the protein tyrosine-kinase FYN, in striatal neurons from human heroin abusers. Additionally, heroin increased Fyn expression in the striatum of rats that undergo heroin self-administration (SA), and in primary striatal neuronal cultures. FYN phosphorylates tau, and hyperphosphorylation of tau is known to precede neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of neurocognitive disease. This proposal leverages high-throughput electronic medical records (EMR) from the Mount Sinai Health System to examine how chronic opioid exposure affects the odds of neurocognitive disease (NCD) on a population level, and EMR from two other hospitals at Columbia University and the University of San Francisco to replicate these effects, using the same analysis pipeline. Additionally, I propose mechanistic studies of Fyn overexpression in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a region known to be affected in NCD and OUD, on heroin SA and cognitive behaviors using animal models. Further, I used a machine learning approach with RNA-seq data obtained from human post-mortem OFC tissue to classify subjects as either belonging to the heroin overdose or control group based on the expression of ~10 genes. Three feature (gene) importance metrics highlighted a transcript, SHISA7, that was reduced in the human OFC, and this finding was replicated in the OFC of rats that underwent heroin self-administration. SHISA7 and FYN both regulate the synaptic function of AMPA receptors, and are components of the post-synaptic density of glutamatergic neurons. I will examine the impact of overexpressing SHISA7, identified using this machine learning approach, in the OFC on heroin SA and cognitive behaviors in animal models. Finally, I will conduct RNA-sequencing experiments on the OFC from Fyn- and Shisa7-manipulated animals, and in downstream bioinformatics analyses, parse key drivers of gene networks to identify potential mechanisms that account for the contribution of these genes to heroin SA and cognitive behaviors. High-throughput clinical and gene expression data from the human can inform translational, mechanistic studies using animal models that will enable a far-reaching understanding of the molecular disturbances underlying the effects of opioids on cognition and addiction. Project Narrative The opioid epidemic is killing over 130 Americans every day, and current treatments consist of opioid substitution therapies, which are fraught with challenges and ineffective at slowing the epidemic. Opioid use disorder is a biological, psychological, and behavioral disease, and our scientific understanding of it must proceed along multiple dimensions of analysis to elucidate its underlying molecular pathophysiology, with the end goal of formulating novel treatments. This project will gain insights into the molecular underpinnings of how opioids affect cognition and addiction, starting from high-throughput human studies using advanced computational methods, proceeding to mechanistic studies using animal models of reversal learning and heroin self-administration behaviors, and further through deep sequencing and bioinformatics studies to characterize gene networks and key drivers impacted by opioid exposure.",Opioid effects on cognition and addiction: Molecular underpinnings,10150982,F31DA051183,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ',

"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,10167665,R01DA046619,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' Central Nervous System Depressants ', ' CNS Depressants ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heroin ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Epidemic ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Fentanyl ', ' Actiq ', ' Duragesic ', ' Fentanest ', ' Fentyl ', ' Phentanyl ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity -

"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,10152467,R01DA048533,"['Adoption ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Communities ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Methods ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' combat ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' METH use ', ' METH using ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,913112,MA-07
"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10339121,R43DA050399,"['Adoption ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' mortality ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' opioid withdrawal ', ' opiate withdrawal ', ' opioid detox ', ' opioid detoxification ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' programs ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Devices ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Opioid Rotation ', ' Narcotic Rotation ', ' Narcotic Substitution ', ' Narcotic Switching ', ' Opioid Substitution ', ' Opioid Switching ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' commercialization ', ' FDA approved ', ' overdose death ', ' overdose fatalities ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' relapse risk ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate therapy ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' overdose risk ', ' methadone treatment ', ' methadone maintenance ', ' methadone maintenance program ', ' methadone maintenance therapy ', ' methadone maintenance treatment ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2021,55000,NC-07
"NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network In CTN-0076-Ot (Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders in Medical Settings: Pilot Usability Testing in an EMR (COMPUTE)), our team iteratively developed and piloted a web-based and electronic health record (EHR)-integrated Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) on the diagnosis and management of OUD. The OUD-CDS, referred to as Opioid Wizard, was implemented within the EPIC EHR of one large care system and piloted with 55 providers to ensure content validity and provider satisfaction. Through CTN-0095 (COMPUTE 2.0), our team will now implement Opioid Wizard in a large multi-site clinic-randomized controlled trial to evaluate its impact on practice process measures and patient outcomes. We also aim to prepare for scalability (i.e., integration into usual primary care practice after the study is complete) and dissemination by evaluating facilitators and barriers to implementation, determining the costs of implementation and maintenance, and assessing the short-term cost impacts of Opioid Wizard.  The study will include three large diverse care systems and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics to receive Opioid Wizard or usual care (UC). In intervention clinics, Opioid Wizard will identify patients who are at high risk` for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; use data stored in the EHR for each eligible patient to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each patient’s current needs; display these recommendations to PCPs via the Opioid Wizard user interface; and store analytic data from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, Opioid Wizard will run invisibly in the background to identify high-risk or OUD patients, assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each eligible patient’s needs, and store analytic data from all targeted visits. This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction. There is a nearly 80% treatment gap in the use of medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD). Conducting a large-scale trial of Opioid Wizard, an opioid use disorder clinical decision support system for primary care settings, has great potential to increase access to MOUD, and could help reduce the nearly $20 billion in annual healthcare costs related to untreated opioid misuse and OUD.",NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network,10379705,UG1DA040316,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ',

"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.
