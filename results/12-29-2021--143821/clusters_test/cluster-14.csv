"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology â€“ optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10222677,R01EY013178,"['Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Floor ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Pathology ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Extracts ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' insight ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Width ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Oximetry ', ' Oxygen saturation measurement ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' tissue oxygen saturation ', ' tissue oxygenation ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Measurable ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' clinical practice ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' invention ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' preservation ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' ocular imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,666892,NY-12
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",10084899,R01EB028146,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Blood flow ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Fe element ', ' Iron ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' respiratory ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic field ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' time use ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' magnetohydrodynamic ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,616003,CA-28
"SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations   The United States population is growing older. There is an urgent need for tools to better connect health professionals with their patients and perform at-home assessments in an automated fashion. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover the knowledge necessary to enable an always-on, non-intrusive, non-wearable smart system for automated at-home gait parameter estimation using floor vibrations. To achieve this vision, the proposal has the objective of connecting health professionals with older adults living independently through a smart system that estimates gait parameters using floor vibration. The aims to achieve this goal are to 1) determine at-home gait parameters as a function of time and space; 2) establish a digital identifier of the older adult based on gait parameters; and 3) correlate changes in at-home gait parameters, after considering spatial-temporal correlations, with changes in the well-being of the resident. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering, physical therapy and public health by testing the following hypotheses: 1) Floor vibration is a viable means to automatically and continuously determine gait parameters; 2) For healthy individuals living in an independent at-home setting, gait parameters will be consistent based on location in the home, time of the day and day of the week; and 3) For patients recently discharged from the hospital, recovery will correlate with improvements in their gait parameters. The testing of the hypotheses will be performed through five tasks: 1) Develop an automated system to capture floor vibration and extract gait parameters; 2) Validate the system in laboratory setting; 3) Collect data at participantâ€™s homes; 4) Test the hypothesis that at-home gait parameters are consistent with time and space; 5) Test the hypothesis that improvement in gait parameters correlates improvement in health status of recently discharged patients. This research will be pursued by a group of interdisciplinary researchers in engineering and physical therapy with the support of an experienced geriatric physician and will advance the knowledge in signal processing techniques, estimation and validation of at-home gait parameters and their uncertainty, and relationship between changes at-home gait parameters and changes in health status. The proposed activities will have a significant impact on older adult care, the research community and the next generation of researchers and engineers stemming from: 1) improved health of older adults and reduced health care cost by early intervening and thus decreasing the readmission rate; 2) increased scientific literacy and public engagement through benchmark problems, interdisciplinary seminars, new courses and outreach activities; 3) the training of diverse convergence researchers competent in solving interdisciplinary problems, including underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The proposed research aligns with the mission of National Institute of Aging by developing automated, non-intrusive, privacy-preserving at-home gait assessment tools based on floor vibrations to correlate changes of gait parameters with the health status of older adults. The outcomes of this project will enable health professionals to monitor the well-being of the older population and manage recovery paradigms thereby improving the health and well-being of older Americans.",SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations  ,10188392,R01AG067395,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Communities ', ' Engineering ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Floor ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Independent Living ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' digital ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' stem ', ' spatial relationship ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' signal processing ', ' scientific literacy ', ' scientifically literate ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' readmission rates ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,294904,SC-06
"Computational Toolkit for Normalizing the Impact of CT Acquisition and Reconstruction on Quantitative Image Features Quantitative image features (QIFs) such as radiomic and deep features hold enormous potential to improve the detection, diagnosis, and treatment assessment of a wide range of diseases. Generated from clinically acquired Computed Tomography (CT) scans, QIFs represent small pixel-wise changes that may be early indicators of disease progression. However, detecting these changes is complicated by variations in the way that CT scans are performed, including variations in acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Ensuring reproducible QIFs is a prerequisite for developing machine learning (ML) models that achieve consistent performance across different clinical settings. This project's premise is that QIFs are sensitive to CT parameters such as radiation dose level, slice thickness, reconstruction kernel, and reconstruction method. The combined interactions among these parameters result in unique image conditions, each yielding its own QIF value. Moreover, some clinical tasks and algorithms are more sensitive to differences in QIF values than others. We hypothesize that a systematic, task-dependent framework to normalize scans and mitigate the impact of variability in CT parameters will identify reproducible QIFs and yield more consistent ML models. Three interrelated innovations will be pursued in this work: 1) a novel framework for characterizing the impact of different acquisition and reconstruction parameters on QIFs and ML models using patient scans with known clinical outcomes in multiple domains; 2) a systematic approach for selecting an optimal mitigation technique and evaluating the impact of normalization; and 3) an open-source software toolkit that formalizes the process of CT normalization, addressing real-world use cases developed by academic and industry collaborators. In Aim 1, we will evaluate how multiple CT parameters influence QIF values and model performance. Utilizing metrics of agreement and a heat map-based visualization, we will determine under which image acquisition and reconstruction conditions the QIFs and model performance are consistent. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate a generative adversarial network-based approach to normalization. Our investigation will focus on targeted mitigation of the set of imaging conditions that are most relevant to a clinical task and on the optimization of how these models are trained. In Aim 3, we will engage a spectrum of external stakeholders to guide the development and adoption of a software toolkit called CT-NORM. Three distinct clinical domains will drive our efforts: lung nodule detection (which relies on identifying small regions of high contrast differences to identify nodules), interstitial lung disease quantification (which depends on characterizing texture differences), and ischemic core assessment (which relies on detecting low contrast differences in brain tissue). CT-NORM will provide the scientific community with an approach and a unified toolkit to characterize and mitigate the impact of reconstruction and acquisition parameters on QIFs and ML model performance. By addressing critical sources of variability, we will improve the process of generating QIFs and facilitate the discovery of precise and reproducible imaging phenotypes of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Computed Tomography (CT) images play an integral role in screening and diagnosing diseases such as lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, and stroke. While artificial intelligence/machine learning models have been con- structed using quantitative image features, model performance can be affected by variations in how the CT images are acquired and reconstructed. This project aims to investigate the effects of varying CT parameters on these image-derived features and to use that information to identify optimal techniques to mitigate their effects in a task-dependent manner.",Computational Toolkit for Normalizing the Impact of CT Acquisition and Reconstruction on Quantitative Image Features,10426507,R56EB031993,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Industry ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Lung nodule ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Interstitial Lung Diseases ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' high resolution CT ', ' High Resolution Computed Tomography ', ' Industry Collaborators ', ' Industry Collaboration ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Seminal ', ' Slice ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' disease phenotype ', ' reconstruction ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' clinical practice ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' screening ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' biomarker development ', ' radiomics ', ' clinical translation ', ' biomarker validation ', ' marker validation ', ' computed tomography screening ', ' CT screening ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2021,611968,CA-33
