"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes.

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) Summary: Overall section Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). In a recently published report, Simmons-Mackie (1) estimates that over two million people in North America are currently living with aphasia. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, the incidence of stroke in younger individuals has been steadily increasing (2). In fact, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina are under the age of 60 (2). Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others’ speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified as the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems and never fully recover. To address the need for studies improving long-term outcomes in aphasia, the Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR), funded for just under four years at the time of this application, has made great progress towards understanding the mechanisms that promote spontaneous and therapy-induced recovery in aphasia. The overarching goal of the research proposed in this renewal application is to maintain our focus on aphasia therapy. Specifically, during the next funding phase, the focus of C-STAR is to improve access to aphasia therapy, enhance the effect of behavioral aphasia therapy to promote an improved aphasia therapy outcome, and understand overall health and neurolinguistic factors that influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will continue to rely on collaboration among five main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Leonardo Bonilha, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will continue to focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects have proven successful in yielding a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia therapy. Relying on this dataset, Bonilha and Rorden’s project will focus on the relationship between brain health and recovery from aphasia, whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to aphasia therapy success as well as new neurolinguistic models of speech and language processing. Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by expanding access to therapy by using telerehabilitation and by understanding the effects of drug therapy, brain health, and neurolinguistic factors on the outcome of aphasia therapy.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),10094377,P50DC014664,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Anodes ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Biography ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Data Collection ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Maps ', ' Persons ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' North America ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' South Carolina ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' brain tissue ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' success ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Manuscripts ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Escitalopram ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' double-blind placebo controlled trial ', ' double-masked controlled trial ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' chronic stroke ', ' speech processing ', ' language processing ', ' telerehabilitation ', ' telerehab ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' Double-blind trial ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' brain health ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke incidence ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke-induced aphasia ', ' aphasia due to stroke ', ' aphasia following stroke ', ' poststroke aphasia ', ' stroke aphasia ', ' stroke survivor with aphasia ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Phase I/II Clinical Trial ', ' Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2021,2558826,SC-06
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,10239050,R01DC014960,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diffusion ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' healing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' stroke recovery ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' support network ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' language impairment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' study population ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' recruit ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,721339,DC-98
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Public sharing of the Aphasia Recovery Cohort Project Summary/Abstract The Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR, P50-DC014664) explores recovery from language impairments following stroke. The center acquires a broad range of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities as well behavioral measures from stroke patients experiencing language impairments. Like all modern large scale NIH grants, C-STAR has a resource sharing plan that guides dissemination of curated data (following an embargo). However, in addition to this data, the C-STAR team has been acquiring images from people with aphasia using our Siemens 3T MRI scanner since 2006. This trove of data, which we refer to as the `Aphasia Recovery Cohort', or ARC, is the product of both internally supported and NIH funded awards that did not require resource sharing plans and includes data from 250 stroke survivors scanned during 5776 unique sessions. In addition to the imaging sessions, ARC patients participated in numerous treatment and assessment sessions providing a rich range of behavioral measures. The current proposal seeks to curate these data to provide an anonymized public database and search tool (ARCquery). This will allow data scientists from around the world to apply their expertise to this archival dataset, providing new insights into brain function as well as identifying predictors of recovery.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,10194459,R13DC017375,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Governing Board ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Production ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Pathologist ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Committee Membership ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonology ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Orthography ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Retrieval ', ' Speech Pathologist ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Non-aphasic ', ' frontier ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' Secure ', ' career networking ', ' career fair ', ' professional networking ', ' speed networking ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' improved outcome ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2021,39939,MA-07
"Exploring the brain basis of rhythm in individuals with aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this proposal is to characterize the neural substrates underlying rhythm abilities and the relationship with language profiles in individuals with aphasia. Aphasia is an acquired communication disorder resulting from damage to language regions of the brain, with stroke as the leading cause. Currently, over 2 million individuals in the United States are living with aphasia. Aphasia is notoriously difficult to treat and patients exhibit significant individual variability in recovery trajectories and in what therapeutic elements work best in aiding such recovery. Speech-language pathologists frequently use rhythmic elements (e.g., tapping to a beat) in the clinic in order to facilitate speech output. However, there is a lack of a deep and systematic empirical assessment of rhythm in aphasia at both a behavioral and neural level. Our first aim is to characterize the neural basis of individual differences in rhythm abilities in individuals with chronic, post-stroke aphasia. To do this, we will administer a comprehensive battery of rhythm perception and production tasks to a large cohort of individuals with aphasia and age-matched controls. We will then employ multivariate lesion-symptom mapping, a machine-learning methodology for identifying brain-behavior relationships, to determine which brain regions are associated with rhythm processing in aphasia. We hypothesize that individuals who have damage to brain regions important for rhythm, including the basal ganglia or the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), will exhibit the greatest impairments in rhythm. Critically, the LIFG is a core language region typically damaged in post-stroke, non-fluent aphasia. Motivated by robust evidence for associations between rhythm and language across cognitive, neural, and behavioral domains, we will assess the relationship between rhythm and language measures in aphasia in our second aim. We predict that individuals with higher rhythm abilities will have higher language scores, particularly on measures of connected speech. This mentored training award will provide the applicant with training in advanced neural and behavioral data analysis techniques and expertise in large-scale project management with a patient cohort. With significant and timely clinical relevance, our proposal will address vital gaps in the literature by taking an individual differences approach to understanding the relationship between rhythm, the brain, and language in aphasia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rhythmic elements (e.g., tapping to a beat) are used frequently by speech-language pathologists to facilitate speech output in individuals with aphasia, despite very little empirical and mechanistic groundwork in this area. This proposal aims to characterize the neural substrates underlying rhythm abilities, and the relationship with language profiles, in individuals with chronic, post-stroke aphasia. The proposed experiments, which make critical links between rhythm, the brain, and language, will provide new knowledge for understanding individual differences in rhythm in aphasia and informing future precision medicine approaches.",Exploring the brain basis of rhythm in individuals with aphasia,10386555,F31DC020112,"['Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Music ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Production ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Pathologist ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' melodic intonation therapy ', ' Brain scan ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Acquired Communication Disorders ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' brain behavior ', ' stem ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' stroke-induced aphasia ', ' aphasia due to stroke ', ' aphasia following stroke ', ' poststroke aphasia ', ' stroke aphasia ', ' stroke survivor with aphasia ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alpha Rhythm ', ' α Rhythm ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' ']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,30787,TN-05
