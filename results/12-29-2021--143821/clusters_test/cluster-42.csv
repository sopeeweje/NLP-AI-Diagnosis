"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,10149408,R01MH117599,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Calibration ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Maps ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Markov Process ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' markov model ', ' process repeatability ', ' process reproducibility ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' discrete time ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' risk prediction model ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' structured data ', ' feature extraction ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,501430,MA-08
"MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION Critical developments in neuroscience have included technologies for sequencing individual brain cells, progress towards completing a full mesoscale brain cell atlas in mice, new tools for monitoring and manipulating the activity of brain cells, refined imaging techniques for developing structural and functional connectome atlases in humans, and new objective measures for characterizing behavior across species. Nevertheless, a critical gap that has yet to be addressed is the development of a model that would allow this emerging catalog of cellular information to be linked to the broad functional networks that encode emotional behavior in mammals. This gap exists in part because 1) technologies that measure, monitor, and decode mesoscale activity throughout the depth of the brain during free behavior in mammalian model species have yet to be implemented in conjunction with cellular activity can be monitored and manipulated, and 2) theoretical frameworks that link cellular activity to mesoscale network activity and that generalize across subjects on a mouse-by-mouse basis have yet to be developed. Our multi-disciplinary team has built a suite of tools for studying how brain dynamics encode complex brain states. These include advanced techniques to measure and monitor brain dynamics in vivo concurrently for months across many regions located throughout the depth of the brain at high spatiotemporal resolution in freely-behaving mice, machine-learning analytic approaches that build individual circuit activity measures into composite networks, behavioral manipulations that can be used to induce brain states related to emotions, viral methods that probe the relationship between cellular changes and the expression of brain-wide neural dynamics, and closed-loop stimulation tools that can potentially test the causality of brain network-states in mediating emotion. By integrating this suite of tools in a single framework, we intend to create a model that will catalogue how the brain generates aggression. Critically, we believe that this model framework will be broadly applicable to other emotional brain states as well. Many cortical and subcortical brain regions work together to coordinate social emotional brain states. In this study we propose to build a model from experimental data that explains how these regions work together to generate aggression. We will test this model using established and emerging therapeutics utilized to treat aggression in the clinic, and we will develop new brain stimulation methodologies to regulate aggressive brain states uncovered by our model.",MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION,10124784,R01MH125430,"['Action Potentials ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electrodes ', ' Emotions ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Instinct ', ' Innate Behavior ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Music ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Oxytocin ', ' Ocytocin ', ' Recombinant Oxytocin ', ' Peptides ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serotonin ', ' 5-HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5HT ', ' Enteramine ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Guanfacine ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' Habenula ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Lateral ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Agonist ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' brain cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' free behavior ', ' sensory motor system ', ' sensorimotor system ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Operating System ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' spatial integration ', ' information processing ', ' emotional behavior ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,608910,NC-04
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,10162316,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Australia ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' Persuasion ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Verbal Behavior ', ' Voice ', ' Voice Quality ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Measures ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' gaze ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' Participant ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' Modality ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Subgroup ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Affective ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' clinical practice ', ' conduct problem ', ' protective factors ', ' deep learning ', ' affective computing ', ' intelligent tutoring system ', ' intelligent tutor ', ' emotional functioning ', ' shared database ', ' shared data base ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,581743,PA-18
"Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors Project Summary/Abstract Rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) among young adults have reached a crisis level, especially for those in the LGBTQ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning and/or transgender) population, who face social stigma in addition to the typical developmental challenges. Although we know the general risk factors for suicide, those have limited utility in predicting how, when, and in whom suicide occurs. It is critically important to consider the role of social context because STB often occurs in response to a recent social threat event such as rejection and could be more likely in those who have altered sensitivity of neural social circuitry. The proposed R01 study in response to RFA MH-20-327 builds on social models such as Minority Stress Theory and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and examines social risk factors of STB from distal to proximal levels. The overarching goal is to predict change in STB, including cumulative intensity of STB and transition from suicidal thoughts to behaviors, on a time scale from hours to days to months. We propose that in LGBTQ young adults, STB occurs through social processing and regulation of socially generated negative affect (e.g., shame). Specifically, we examine the distal vulnerability factors of sensitivity in social brain circuitry and negative urgency, or the tendency toward impulsive behavior in the face of painful negative affect, and the proximal, time-varying factors of sleep dysregulation and social experiences (e.g., rejection). The study will test the association of these distal and proximal factors with STB; differences in these factors between LGBTQ young adults with vs. without STB; the interplay of distal and proximal factors; and the role of LGBTQ-related characteristics (e.g., victimization, outness) in STB. The study will include 130 participants age 18-30, all of whom identify as LGBTQ and 2/3 of whom have recurrent suicidal ideation and lifetime history of suicidal behavior. Participants will complete a detailed interview of STB, an fMRI scan using social threat paradigms, a 3-month protocol of actigraphy and smartphone-based assessment, and a follow-up interview at 6 months. Smartphone data will include ecological momentary assessment of social threat experiences and STB, as well as passively collected sensor data (e.g., social media app use, texting activity). Traditional and machine learning quantitative techniques will be applied to determine contributions of distal and proximal factors to STB (e.g., occurrence of suicidal behavior), individual differences in risk factors, and contributions of neural, sleep, social, clinical, and demographic factors to STB. The study will elucidate the role of modifiable risk factors in STB and have relevance to clinical neuroscience, suicidology, and prevention efforts. Project Narrative Suicide in LGBTQ young adults has reached a crisis level, but our ability to predict and prevent suicide has not improved in 50 years. We will use brain imaging, actigraphy, and smartphone technology to measure critical social precipitants of suicidality and their interaction with general risk factors. With machine learning, a technique based on artificial intelligence, we will combine these sources of data to determine the way suicidal thoughts and behaviors develop over hours, days, and months.",Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors,10106761,R01MH124900,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hotlines ', ' Telephone Hotlines ', ' Impulsive Behavior ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Shame ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Distress ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Victimization ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' Affective ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bi-Sexual ', ' Same-sex ', ' queer ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' brain circuitry ', ' social media ', ' Data Analytics ', ' family support ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bi-sexual Transgender Queer ', ' smartphone based assessment ', ' mobile assessment ', ' smart phone based assessment ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,754061,PA-18
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors.

"SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In recent years, human cognitive auditory neuroscience has made rapid strides due to advances in human neuroimaging, the advent of innovative machine learning/big data analytic approaches, and a greater mechanistic understanding of cognitive-sensory interactions in animal models. The dynamic landscape of this emergent field necessitates a highly interdisciplinary, human and translation-centric symposium that brings together expertise across academia and industry. This application requests partial funding for the Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) to be hosted in Pittsburgh, PA in July 2020 and 2022, as a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). As a biennial meeting, SCAN aims to become the premiere intellectual and professional venue for current research in the emerging field of human cognitive auditory neuroscience. SCAN will incorporate elements typical to academic conferences (research talks, posters) as well as novel ideas that promote ‘blue sky’ thinking in this rapidly evolving field. SCAN will assiduously and innovatively work towards inclusivity and creating an atmosphere that encourages intellectual and professional engagement from women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals with disabilities. Another critical aim of the SCAN is to foster industry-academic partnerships with an eye towards translation of basic research and fostering career opportunities for trainees. Pittsburgh is uniquely situated to launch SCAN. With an enviable concentration of co-located auditory neuroscience expertise, Pittsburgh is also an intellectual hub for industries/start-ups engaged in in machine learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit

"Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder Project Summary/Abstract Prevention of suicidal behavior, especially among patients with mood disorders, is of uttermost importance among mental health professionals. Patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which affects around 1-2% of the population, are at a particularly high risk for developing suicidal behavior, with 25-50% of patients making at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. In addition, although there is evidence that BD and suicide share a genetic risk and that stress may play a key role in suicidality, the mechanisms by which some patients are more vulnerable to suicidal behavior than others are vastly unknown. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may underlie suicide risk among BD patients. Moreover, DNA methylation markers may provide clinically-relevant biomarkers for the identification of patients at highest risk for suicidal behavior. These hypotheses will be tested by completing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNA methylation alterations with the latest-generation Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K platform in a discovery sample of neurons isolated from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from patients with BD that committed suicide or died of other causes and controls. Promising markers will be validated by oxidative bisulfite pyrosequencing and further explored by pathway analyses. In Aim 2, we will investigate the coordinated changes between genetic risk for BD and suicide attempt and DNA methylation alterations in post-mortem prefrontal cortex using the same cohort as Aim 1 and a replication cohort from the UTHealth Brain Collection for Research in Psychiatric Disorders. In Aim 3, we will analyze the clinical correlates of methylome markers of suicide in an independent cohort of adult patients with BD that have previously attempted to commit suicide or not, compared to healthy controls, from which a comprehensive dataset with demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical data is available, as well as genome-wide methylation and genotyping data. Specific targets and pathways predicting suicidal behavior will be further explored by sophisticated statistics and bioinformatics tools while controlling for co-variables known to associate with suicidal risk, followed by the development of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of suicidality at the individual level. Of note, the overarching goal of this K01 is to further the PI’s expertise in the biology and clinical aspects of suicide, bioinformatics, post-mortem analyses, and epigenomics, which will ensure a methodologically strong foundation to launch an independent lab in psychiatric epigenetics. Importantly, a strong group of mentors and collaborators with a remarkable track record in training junior faculty has been selected to provide intellectual and technical input during the award period. In addition, the outstanding resources, facilities, and multidisciplinary scientific community at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Medical Center represent an ideal environment to ensure that the PI accomplishes his research and career objectives. This proposal is well aligned with the mission of the NIMH, and it will not only provide the PI with crucial training required to his transition to full independence, but also address important, testable questions regarding the poorly understood risk for suicide among BD patients and the lack of specific tools for the identification of vulnerable subjects. Project Narrative Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder significantly increasing its risk possibly due to a shared genetic and epigenetic risk. However, there are no clinically-useful biomarkers available for the prediction of suicidality in patients and very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of suicide in this disorder, which limits our ability to provide targeted prophylactic interventions for susceptible subjects. Here we propose to conduct a multidisciplinary translational study to identify a clinically-relevant DNA methylation biosignature to predict suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder patients and its association with clinical and neuroanatomical parameters.",Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder,10165832,K01MH121580,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Faculty ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Masks ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' career ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' prophylactic ', ' cell type ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Early identification ', ' commit suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' pyrosequencing ', ' epigenomics ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' translational study ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' high risk ', ' biosignature ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' methylome ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' methylation marker ', ' bead chip ', ' BeadChip ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' methylomics ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2021,174843,TX-09
"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10083111,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' ED Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ER nurse ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Blinded ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Cervical spine ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' implementation barriers ', ' implementation challenges ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,814463,MA-02
"Passive Assessment of Behavioral Warning Signs for Suicide Risk in Adolescents: An Idiographic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The rise in suicide rates is due in part to a failure to identify short-term risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additionally, most existing research relies primarily on group-level methodological approaches to suicide risk assessment; intraindividual suicide risk processes are largely neglected. Because of the lack of knowledge on short-term and individual-level suicide risk, it remains unclear when and how to intervene with the individual adolescents who need it most. Three particularly promising observable, state-sensitive, temporally delimited, and modifiable proximal indicators of suicide risk among adolescents are social engagement, sleep, and physical activity. Although acute changes in these behavioral processes are often denoted as imminent “behavioral warning signs” of suicide, most existing research has examined these behavioral factors only as distal predictors and correlates of suicide risk. Importantly, their contribution to short- term risk using individual-level approaches (i.e., fully idiographic, “n-of-1” methods) remains unknown. The Candidate’s proposed K23’s overarching goal is to employ mobile sensing and actigraphy to assess whether objectively and passively measured acute behavioral changes from typical patterns of social engagement, sleep, and physical activity indicate proximal risk for increases in suicidal ideation using idiographic n-of-1 models in high-risk adolescents. It further aims to characterize the intraindividual network structure of these behavioral factors and suicidal ideation to enhance suicide risk assessment and guide intervention. Adolescents (N=100) admitted to an inpatient or partial hospital program due to acute suicide risk will be recruited. For a period of 3 months, wearable actigraphs will be used to assess adolescents’ sleep and physical activity and mobile sensing will be used to assess adolescents’ digital social engagement and patterns of movement to approximate additional indices of physical activity. Once-daily mobile surveys will be used to assess suicidal ideation. The proposed training plan complements the Candidate’s research plan and will facilitate training in: conducting translational digital health research in high-risk adolescents, passive mobile sensing, passive adolescent sleep and physical activity assessment via actigraphy, and advanced computational approaches to person-specific intensive data modeling. A team of leading scholars will provide expert mentorship to facilitate the Candidate’s training goals within the highly resourced environment of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. The proposed study will promote the Candidate’s long-term career goal to employ low-burden and scalable methods of assessment to develop personalized risk models that will improve the proximal prediction of suicide risk and inform intervention for youth. Through the execution of this research and training plan, the Candidate will be positioned to become a leader in the field of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The goal of the present study is to develop personalized risk models of adolescent suicidal ideation based on passive and objective data sources (using wearables and smartphone sensors indexing social engagement, sleep, and physical activity).

"Redefine Trans-Neuropsychiatric Disorder Brain Patterns through Big-Data and Machine Learning Abstract This application will combine the strengths of two large scale NIH-funded initiatives to understand disorder- related patterns in the human brain: Connectomes Related to Human Disease (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA). We will develop and evaluate novel brain vulnerability metrics - based on the idea of polygenic risk scores – that we expect to better predict diagnosis and cognitive performance than standard neuroimaging measures. We define a metric of “vulnerability” by quantifying the similarity between each individual's brain pattern and deficit patterns in neuropsychiatric disorders. The Regional Vulnerability Index (RVI) uses Big Data meta-analyses to quantify the similarity between an individual and meta-analytical deficit effect size patterns based on large and diverse international samples. The Machine Learning-Vulnerability Index (MVI) is trained using Big Data mega-analytic samples to quantify the similarity for individual brain patterns to those learned from patients and controls. We will compute novel, cross-domain vulnerability metrics to phenotype each of the N=3,350 CHRD individuals across three mainly psychiatric (schizophrenia-spectrum and psychosis disorder, major depression, and bipolar disorder), three mainly neurological (epilepsy, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease) and three neuroimaging domains (structural, diffusion, and resting state functional MRI). Our Specific Aims merge CRHD and ENIGMA data to test four hypotheses: 1) Neuropsychiatric illnesses not only impact an isolated region or circuit, but are associated with deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that can be unique to each illness; 2) such deficit patterns are informative of cognitive deficits in patients; 3) similarity with the deficit patterns will have higher specificity and sensitivity than any traditional neuroimaging metric or trait; and 4) similarity at the voxel- and vertex-based level may lead to development of high-resolution vulnerability indices. We will test these hypotheses by performing patient-control sensitivity and specificity analyses in the corresponding CRHD illness groups; study the degree of separation vs. commonality across psychiatric and neurological disorders; and evaluate pattern differences at specific stages of the illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease. We will use multivariate mediation analyses to link vulnerability to variance in cognitive domains ascertained by CHRD. This short, intensive project will benefit the community-at-large by populating the CHRD/HCP database with novel multimodal brain phenotypes extracted and homogenized using standard ENIGMA workflows, enriched with Open Science approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE The Connectomes Related to Human Disease/Human Connectome Project (CRHD) and Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) are two large scale NIH-funded initiatives exploring disorder-related patterns in the human brain. The two projects are complementary: CRHD focuses on in-depth, high-resolution multimodal phenotyping of the brain connectome in modest samples, whereas ENIGMA's analyses harness the statistical power of large and inclusive, worldwide samples. We propose combining the strengths of CRHD and ENIGMA to test novel biomarkers based on replicable and consistent illness deficit patterns provided by Big Data studies. We posit that major brain illnesses do not impact an isolated region or brain circuit but rather lead to deficit patterns across multiple brain regions and circuits that are shared or unique to an illness; such deficit patterns are highly replicable and linked to severity, duration and treatment resistance. We will develop and evaluate a multivariate vulnerability model based on (1) the degree of similarity between an individual's brain patterns and expected disorder patterns defined as a linear combination of deficits - conceptually similar to polygenic risk scores - and (2) a vulnerability metric computed using machine learning. We will test the specificity and sensitivity of these models against the single most discriminative neuroimaging traits in six diagnostic categories shared by CRHD and ENIGMA: schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) and psychosis, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorders (BP), epilepsy (EP), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

"Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation Maintaining an adaptive balance of emotions is central to well-being, and dysregulated emotions contribute broadly to clinical disorders that impart high personal and societal burdens. Recognizing the transdiagnostic importance of emotion to mental health, the National Institute of Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix contains overarching domains of Negative Valence, Positive Valence, and Arousal. However, the matrix underspecifies how specific affective states like sadness, anxiety, or craving are organized within and across these domains, in part because it is unknown whether representations of discrete emotions are reliably differentiated. Other RDoC constructs, such as rumination and worry, modify the temporal parameters of emotions that confer psychopathology risk and exacerbate symptom maintenance. Nonetheless, it is unknown how these processes interface with emotional brain circuits to impact affect dynamics, particularly as they often occur spontaneously during mind wandering. The proposed research promises to improve the RDoC depiction of these emotion-related constructs by taking an affective computing approach. During combined recording of psychophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adult participants will experience emotions to vignettes and movie clips spanning the arousal and valence dimensions, and will report on their spontaneous emotions during resting-state fMRI scans. Machine learning algorithms will decode emotion- specific signals across the levels of analysis, which will be integrated using Bayesian state-space modeling. An analysis of classifier errors will test competing predictions from emotion theories regarding the optimal structure of affective space. Using graph theoretic tools, we will characterize the neural network architecture of the discrete emotion representations to identify provincial and connector hubs that can be used as novel targets for future symptom-specific or co-morbid neuromodulation interventions, respectively. We will apply the emotion-specific maps to resting-state data from the same participants to create neurophysiological indices of spontaneous emotions and to relate their frequencies to measures of trait and state affect as a validation step. Using stochastic modeling of the resting-state data, we will derive temporal dynamics metrics to test the hypothesis that rumination and worry promote emotional inertia during mind wandering. Finally, we will use existing data repositories to demonstrate that our novel indices of affect dynamics transdiagnostically differentiate resting-state fMRI activity patterns in mental health disorders from healthy controls. The proposed research will improve upon current RDoC formulations of Negative Affect, Positive Affect, and Arousal domains by informing how discrete emotions are organized within and across these domains, by integrating emotion representations across multiple RDoC units of analysis, by informing how rumination and worry impact neurophysiological signatures of spontaneous emotions, and by establishing the clinical utility of computationally-derived metrics of emotion dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goal of this project is to characterize how emotions are represented in the brain and autonomic nervous system. Computational modeling approaches will be applied to integrate the data across multiple sources and tasks, to test competing theories about how emotions are organized, and to derive new metrics of emotion dynamics. The outcome of the work will inform how emotions should be conceptualized within a broader research framework of mental health domains.",Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation,10227196,R01MH124112,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Space Models ', ' tool ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' movie ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' markov model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Affective ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' Formulation ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' affective computing ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,774017,NC-04
"Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE) ABSTRACT  Despite intensive prevention efforts from federal and state agencies, suicide is now the 10th leading cause of mortality overall in the US, increasing steadily over the past two decades and claiming more than 47,000 lives in 2017. The impact of suicide is particularly high among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and formerly incarcerated individuals. Suicide attempts also exact a high emotional, physical, and economic toll.  Although much research has focused on causes and predictors of death from suicide, progress in suicide prevention has been hampered by data linkage and methodological challenges. While national mortality rates are known, entities with the potential to implement large suicide prevention initiatives – health systems, insurers, and departments of corrections – lack the linked data to monitor suicide incidence in their populations, establish benchmarks, and establish an evaluation framework for prevention efforts. Many individuals who die from suicide have had recent contact with a health care, health insurance, or correctional system, representing critical missed opportunities to implement suicide prevention measures.  Two key needs are highlighted by the present RFA: linked surveillance systems that integrate healthcare, insurer (private and public), and correctional data with mortality outcomes to provide a framework for implementing and evaluating suicide prevention initiatives, and large and adequately powered datasets with rich health care access information over an extended period, matched with rigorous study designs for observational data. Therefore, our objective in the current proposal is to establish an in-depth suicide surveillance system linking multiple large, comprehensive databases and use that system to define suicide mortality benchmarks, identify predictors of suicide risk, generate risk prediction tools, evaluate suicide prevention efforts, and establish long-term workflow protocols to sustain the surveillance system. Our team is uniquely positioned to address these needs through our deep expertise in suicide, mental health, and health care utilization research; our extensive experience in application of rigorous epidemiological methods to large linked databases; our established access to comprehensive, regularly updated databases representing health care encounters, public and private insurance claims, corrections data, and suicide deaths in one of the most populous states in the US; and our successful work in prior projects to link all of these databases at the individual level using all appropriate safeguards and security measures.  This project will be the first to link these large state- and healthcare system-level databases to establish an ongoing suicide surveillance system to identify short and long term predictors of suicide and to inform and evaluate suicide prevention efforts in North Carolina and across the United States. We anticipate such suicide prevention efforts will get embedded in healthcare systems where at-risk individuals can be identified and referred for prevention and care, thereby preventing suicides and reducing their societal impacts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will define suicide mortality rates for four key target populations of patients either engaged in health care, privately or publicly insured, or recently released from prison; will define clinical predictors of suicide mortality risk; will evaluate the impact of a health care system-delivered routine suicidal risk assessment protocol on suicide mortality risk; and will lay the groundwork for the ongoing continuation of the suicide mortality surveillance system.",Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE),10259794,R01MH124752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Records ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Prisons ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Security Measures ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' suicidal mortality ', ' suicide mortality rate ', ' suicide mortality ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' correctional system ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' prevention evaluation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' years of life lost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' clinical predictors ', ' study population ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' insurance claims ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,750074,NC-04
"Behavioral and Neurocognitive Mechanisms linking Peer Victimization to Adolescent Psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability for many forms of psychopathology, particularly depression, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors. Disorders that emerge during this time have lasting consequences, including elevated risk of recurrence, and poor psychosocial functioning. This vulnerability comes at a time when peer victimization becomes more common and emotional and physiological responses to peer rejection are elevated, rendering victimization particularly damaging during adolescence. Despite the strong links between peer victimization and internalizing problems during adolescence, the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear, limiting our ability to prevent the onset of victimization-related psychopathology in youth. The proposed project will test a novel conceptual model, in which it is proposed that two underlying dimensions of peer victimization, peer threat (e.g., presence of negative social experiences, like rejection) and peer deprivation (e.g., absence of positive social experiences, like ostracism) differentially shape neurocognitive processes and social behaviors that have relevance for psychopathology. Specifically, it is argued that peer threat influences neurocognitive and behavioral processes in ways that enhance threat detection and processing (Aim 1), whereas experiences of peer deprivation may contribute to blunted reward sensitivity and low social motivation (Aim 2). The project will then examine whether neurocognitive and behavioral alterations serve as mechanisms linking peer victimization with internalizing psychopathology (Aim 3). The proposed research will test this conceptual model by using a combination of experimental behavioral and fMRI tasks, as well as an intensive longitudinal design, leveraging advancements in digital phenotyping, computational neuroscience, and predictive modeling approaches. Critically, by implementing advanced statistical machine learning methods for predictive modeling, the proposed research may be able to identify patterns of real-world social behavior that are influenced by victimization and, in turn, predict the emergence of psychopathology. Identifying developmental processes that are disrupted following peer victimization and ultimately lead to psychopathology is a necessary first step in developing targeted intervention approaches. This award will also provide the candidate, who has a strong background in developmental social neuroscience and clinical science, with critical training in the implementation of digital phenotyping, computational modeling, and advanced statistical techniques to promote a successful transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peer victimization is a common and potent predictor of psychopathology in adolescence, but the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown. I will test a novel conceptual model assessing how dimensions of peer victimization—peer threat and peer deprivation—differentially shape neurocognitive processes and social behaviors that confer risk for internalizing psychopathology. Identifying developmental processes that are disrupted following peer victimization and ultimately lead to psychopathology is a necessary first step in developing targeted intervention approaches to mitigate the effects of peer victimization on youths.",Behavioral and Neurocognitive Mechanisms linking Peer Victimization to Adolescent Psychopathology,10371679,K99MH126163,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Motivation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' peer victimization ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' social neuroscience ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' prospective ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' reward processing ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' information processing ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' social media ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' social engagement ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,123903,MA-05
"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,10254382,R44MH118780,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' systematic review ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicide model ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' data visualization ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Self-Direction ', ' substance misuse ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' advanced analytics ', ' Data Store ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2021,746613,IL-07
"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools.

"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,10245124,F31MH121039,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Sweden ', ' Translating ', ' World Health Organization ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' suicidal ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' Performance ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' translational pipeline ', ' translational spectrum ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2021,48536,IN-09
"Removing and Manipulating Emotional Information in Working Memory: Cognitive and Neural Representations PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of the current project is to understand how emotional thoughts can be removed from one's mind. Most psychiatric disorders are characterized by an inability to remove negative, intrusive, and maladaptive thoughts from mind. Previously examining whether an individual has purged a thought from mind has relied mainly on self-report measures (e.g., “Yes, I stopped thinking about the car crash”). In the proposed research, the research team will use a combination of brain imaging approaches with machine learning techniques drawn from computer science to provide an objective neural marker of whether indeed a thought has been removed from mind. This approach builds on proven success with this technique pioneered by the research team. This prior work focused on the removal of (emotionally neutral) information from mind and demonstrated that suppressing a specific thought and clearing one's mind of all thought rely on different neural mechanisms. Moreover, the prior findings indicated that these mental operations differentially affect one's ability to take in new information after the old information has been removed. The focus of the proposed project will be to examine how emotional information is removed from current thought. The project will ask three main questions. First, it will examine whether the emotional valence of information affects the engagement and effectiveness of neural systems involved in removing information from mind. A series of parallel studies, one involving neuroimaging and the other examining people's behavior, are designed to examine whether these removal operations are affected by a) the emotional valence (positive, negative) of the information to be removed, b) the emotional valence of the information that should now be brought to mind and c) the match (e.g., positive, positive) or mismatch (positive, negative) between the valence of the information being removed and that which replaces it. Expectations are that negative information will be harder to remove and easier to be brought into current thought than positive information. Second, the project will examine whether the effectiveness of these removal operations varies across individuals. It will assess the degree to which individuals report that they have difficulty controlling their thoughts, the degree to which they have symptoms related to depression and anxiety, and their ability to hold and manipulate information in working memory. Expectations are that individuals who report difficulty in controlling their thoughts will have difficulty in removing information from mind, and that people with higher levels of depression will have specific difficulties in removing negative thoughts. Third, the project will examine whether individuals can be trained, using real-time feedback about brain function during neuroimaging, to effectively remove thoughts from mind by providing them with a sense of what it feels like to successfully remove a thought. The results of the proposed project will have important implications both for understanding the recurrent and intrusive thoughts that characterize psychopathology and for providing insights on how they might be reduced. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to understand the mental processes and brain systems that enable people to purposefully remove emotional thoughts from their minds. The project will utilize neuroimaging of the brain in conjunction with cutting-edge computational techniques taken from computer science to assess how well individuals can remove specific thoughts from mind. This work has important implications for psychiatric disorders in which the ability to remove specific negative, intrusive, or maladaptive thoughts is compromised.",Removing and Manipulating Emotional Information in Working Memory: Cognitive and Neural Representations,10450323,R56MH125642,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Emotional ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Mind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' traffic collision ', ' traffic crash ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' cognitive control ', ' neural patterning ', ' neurofeedback ', ' operation ', ' associated symptom ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R56,2021,770369,CO-02
"Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE) ABSTRACT  Despite intensive prevention efforts from federal and state agencies, suicide is now the 10th leading cause of mortality overall in the US, increasing steadily over the past two decades and claiming more than 47,000 lives in 2017. The impact of suicide is particularly high among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and formerly incarcerated individuals. Suicide attempts also exact a high emotional, physical, and economic toll.  Although much research has focused on causes and predictors of death from suicide, progress in suicide prevention has been hampered by data linkage and methodological challenges. While national mortality rates are known, entities with the potential to implement large suicide prevention initiatives – health systems, insurers, and departments of corrections – lack the linked data to monitor suicide incidence in their populations, establish benchmarks, and establish an evaluation framework for prevention efforts. Many individuals who die from suicide have had recent contact with a health care, health insurance, or correctional system, representing critical missed opportunities to implement suicide prevention measures.  Two key needs are highlighted by the present RFA: linked surveillance systems that integrate healthcare, insurer (private and public), and correctional data with mortality outcomes to provide a framework for implementing and evaluating suicide prevention initiatives, and large and adequately powered datasets with rich health care access information over an extended period, matched with rigorous study designs for observational data. Therefore, our objective in the current proposal is to establish an in-depth suicide surveillance system linking multiple large, comprehensive databases and use that system to define suicide mortality benchmarks, identify predictors of suicide risk, generate risk prediction tools, evaluate suicide prevention efforts, and establish long-term workflow protocols to sustain the surveillance system. Our team is uniquely positioned to address these needs through our deep expertise in suicide, mental health, and health care utilization research; our extensive experience in application of rigorous epidemiological methods to large linked databases; our established access to comprehensive, regularly updated databases representing health care encounters, public and private insurance claims, corrections data, and suicide deaths in one of the most populous states in the US; and our successful work in prior projects to link all of these databases at the individual level using all appropriate safeguards and security measures.  This project will be the first to link these large state- and healthcare system-level databases to establish an ongoing suicide surveillance system to identify short and long term predictors of suicide and to inform and evaluate suicide prevention efforts in North Carolina and across the United States. We anticipate such suicide prevention efforts will get embedded in healthcare systems where at-risk individuals can be identified and referred for prevention and care, thereby preventing suicides and reducing their societal impacts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will define suicide mortality rates for four key target populations of patients either engaged in health care, privately or publicly insured, or recently released from prison; will define clinical predictors of suicide mortality risk; will evaluate the impact of a health care system-delivered routine suicidal risk assessment protocol on suicide mortality risk; and will lay the groundwork for the ongoing continuation of the suicide mortality surveillance system.",Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE),10457534,R01MH124752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Records ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Prisons ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Security Measures ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' suicidal mortality ', ' suicide mortality rate ', ' suicide mortality ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' correctional system ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' prevention evaluation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' years of life lost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' clinical predictors ', ' study population ', ' health care availability ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' insurance claims ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,61042,NC-04
"Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework PROJECT SUMMARY Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 6.7% to 7.3% of people globally each year and incur a large burden on people’s lives. To address this urgent problem, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the neural bases of subjective experiences in anxiety, including threat perception. Translational neuroscience has focused on animal models of defensive behavior involving a core set of regions. Although these animal models and the human subjects research they inspired have led to advances in treatment of anxiety, the mapping between neural mechanisms and subjective experience remains poorly understood. The set of regions found to support defensive behavior in animal models does not appear to be involved in all instances of fear or anxiety. The current project overcomes this barrier by integrating current models of anxiety with predictive coding models of the mind and brain. Incorporating predictive coding into models of anxiety will offer a better understanding of how neural activity relates to subjective experiences important to anxiety (e.g., threat perception). The project tests two parallel hypotheses about neural representation of threat perception suggested by predictive coding models: that neural representations of threat perception are content-specific (Aim 1) and that neural representations of threat perception depend on expectations (Aim 2). Using a single design, we manipulate content-specificity and expectations to test these two hypotheses in parallel. We use fMRI to measure brain activity and use self-report and peripheral psychophysiology to measure subjective experiences of threat perception. To the extent that participants find stimuli threatening (as indexed by self-report and psychophysiology), we hypothesize that we will observe relatively content-specific neural representations of threat. We also hypothesize that neural representations of threat will differ under conditions of expectation vs. expectancy violation. The effect of expectation may impact content-specific neural activity or activity in a core set of regions. The knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential improve understanding of the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences. Relevant for translational neuroscience, a better understanding of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety will be critical to closing the gap between laboratory research and more effective treatments for anxiety. More broadly, predictive coding models are models of basic brain function. Thus, the predictive coding model we propose offers a new theoretical framework that is generalizable to psychiatric illnesses involving disordered threat perception (e.g., schizophrenia) and other affective disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder). PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent work suggests that the effectiveness of treatments for anxiety has been over-estimated10-13 and development of new treatments have stalled5-8, in part, because the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences that produce anxiety (e.g., perceiving threats) remains poorly understood. The proposed project addresses this gap in knowledge by examining the neural basis of a subjective experience important anxiety and anxiety disorders (threat perception) using a model of brain function from cognitive neuroscience. In doing so, the proposed project offers a novel theoretical framework that allows for better modeling of the relationship between neural activity and subjective experiences (e.g., threat perception) in anxiety, which has the potential to advance understanding of the mechanisms that drive anxiety and anxiety disorders.",Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework,10240282,F32MH122062,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' indexing ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Physiology ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' expectation effect ', ' nocebo ', ' placebo response ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Expectancy ', ' Mind ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' neural model ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' fusiform face area ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' anxiety treatment ', ' pain processing ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,66390,MA-07
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact.

"Progressive social withdrawal in trauma-exposed older adolescents and young adults: neurocircuitry predictors Social withdrawal is a transdiagnostic phenotype that is strongly associated with detrimental physical and mental health outcomes across the lifespan. As quantified using structural features of individuals’ social networks, social withdrawal is associated with 60-70% increased mortality and a threefold increase in suicide risk. Recent findings document associations between trauma-related psychopathology and altered social network structural features, including size, density, diversity, and embeddedness. Critically, because the transition to adulthood (age 16-20) is a period of rapid expansion in social networks, forms of psychopathology that produce social withdrawal may confer particular risk for poor outcomes during this developmental stage. Thus, the transition to adulthood is a key developmental period for the evolution of social withdrawal in trauma- exposed populations. Recent literature indicates that social reward processing may drive social network size and complexity, but the role of disrupted social reward functioning in driving progressive social withdrawal following trauma exposure is poorly understood. Using an innovative longitudinal design including digital phenotyping of social behavior, the proposed study will investigate activity and connectivity within brain regions that bidirectionally code for social approach and avoidance, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The hypothesis is that BLA-VMPFC- NAcc functional connectivity will prospectively predict progressive social withdrawal during the transition to adulthood following interpersonal trauma exposure. We will enroll 120 trauma-exposed participants (ages 16- 20) who endorse posttraumatic and/or depressive symptoms, and 60 healthy controls. Trauma-exposed participants will be stratified for baseline self-reported social anhedonia. We obtain baseline social withdrawal measures, including active self-reports of social interaction and passive smartphone based phenotyping of activity via accelerometer, GPS, and call/text metadata. Participants will complete an fMRI scan to obtain measures of BLA-VMPFC-NAcc connectivity, followed by one year of digital phenotyping using active and passive data to measure social withdrawal. Based on our extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that: 1) baseline social withdrawal will be associated with baseline BLA-VMPFC-NAcc connectivity; (2) baseline BLA- VMPFC-NAcc connectivity will prospectively predict progressive social withdrawal over the course of a 12- month follow-up; (3) predictive models of social withdrawal that include BLA-VMPFC-NAcc connectivity will outperform alternate models. The proposed integrated approach (fMRI, digital phenotyping) will identify specific circuitry associated with progressive social withdrawal during the transition to adulthood, and will develop predictive algorithms that forecast social withdrawal trajectories based on baseline connectivity within BLA- VMPFC-NAcc circuitry. Ultimately this work could lead to the development of targeted interventions (e.g. neurofeedback), and may shift the field toward reward-circuitry accounts of social withdrawal. Individuals with a history of interpersonal trauma exposure are at risk for progressive social withdrawal during the transition to adulthood (ages 16-20), and although social withdrawal is strongly associated with detrimental health outcomes, neurobiological processes that contribute to social withdrawal following trauma exposure have not been identified. In line with NIMH Objective 2.2 (Identify and understand risk factors, biomarkers, and behavioral indicators of mental illnesses and of intervention responses across the lifespan), in the short term this study will: (1) identify how connectivity within a specified neural circuit is associated with baseline social withdrawal as well as change in social withdrawal over time, and (2) develop predictive algorithms that can forecast future social withdrawal based on baseline connectivity within the circuit. In the long term, understanding how connectivity within this circuit contributes to progressive social withdrawal may contribute to the development of interventions that target this circuit (e.g. neurofeedback) and may shift the field toward emphasizing the role of reward processing abnormalities in contributing to social withdrawal in trauma-exposed individuals.",Progressive social withdrawal

"ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders Project Abstract:  Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing plays a major role in shaping transcriptome diversity by creating variant isoforms that enable fine-tuning of calcium-mediated excitatory and other signaling needed for brain development, neural plasticity and mood regulation. The spatio-temporal ADAR editing landscapes are tightly regulated by controlling ADAR expression levels to preserve preferential binding and editing. Previous studies have shown that activation of the interferon pathways of the innate immune system – such as those seen in viral infections - leads to increased expression of ADAR1p150, which ultimately results in changes to ADAR editing patterns. Furthermore, common side effects to innate immune activation by interferon alpha therapies include increased risk of depression and suicide. The changes in spatio-temporal regulation of editing patterns can lead to a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, including neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., decreased ADAR editing in the serotonin receptor subunit2C in the prefrontal cortex observed in individuals who commit suicide). Yet, our understanding of ADAR editing landscapes remain cursory. Advances in high throughput RNA-seq enable more accurate variant calling from the sequencing reads, providing a way to map ADAR editing patterns in the transcriptome. However, there are no computational pipelines focused on ADAR editing that are easy to use, are reproducible and can handle large scale analysis. I have recently built a pipeline to handle meta-analysis of RNA-seq data that incorporates variant calling steps, but further work is needed to validate this tool to assure accuracy and reproducibility of results. It can then be used to map the spatio-temporal variation of ADAR editing landscapes. The proposed project will study ADAR editing landscapes in the following ways: (i) new computational pipelines will be benchmarked to use variant calling with RNA-seq datasets using simulated reads, (ii) ADAR editing landscape diversity in the publicly available human samples will be mapped; the computational predictions and hypotheses generated from the pipeline will be validated using (iii) measuring calcium flux in cells with known differential ADAR editing landscapes caused by PolyI:C (viral infection mimic) treatment. The proposed work will yield a validated pipeline capable of mapping ADAR editing landscapes with machine learning algorithms. Defining ADAR editing landscapes is paramount to biomarker discovery and can influence precision medicine applications in diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This project will allow for me to gain the knowledge base necessary to become an independent researcher with a unique skill set of both computational and benchwork methods to advance the field of neuroscience. Project Narrative Inferring ADAR editing landscapes and their link with ion homeostasis and excitatory signaling in the brain is important for understanding, diagnosing or staging neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and suicide. This proposed project will develop and validate computational tools to use RNA-seq from publicly available datasets for ADAR editing inferences and to delineate patterns of editing changes in cells experiencing viral infections. Overall, this project will give me the training to build my unique skill set of both computational and experimental methods that will enable me as an independent researcher to bridge the gap between bioinformatics and experimental researchers and translate my findings into precision medicine.",ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders,10238770,F31MH123131,"['Accounting ',

"Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for a Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) from Dr. Lorenzo Pasquini, a postdoctoral scholar in clinical neuroimaging at the Memory and Aging Center (MAC), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Pasquini is an early-career neuroscientist investigating the neural systems underlying socioemotional symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Pasquini has a strong background in neuroscience, clinical neuroimaging, and machine-learning techniques, but he requires mentored research and high-level training in four different areas to become established as an independent investigator. The training and research program outlined in this proposal will provide Dr. Pasquini with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) gain extended expertize in the clinical manifestation of socioemotional symptoms among elderly populations; 2) achieve proficiency in analysis of multimodal dynamic systems through the application of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms; 3) get proficiency in the analysis of autonomic physiological recordings; and 4) develop an independent research career niche based on scientific productivity and grant applications. To achieve these goals, Dr. Pasquini has assembled a mentorship team including a primary mentor, Dr. William Seeley, a behavioral neurologist with deep expertize in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging of neurodegenerative diseases; a co-mentor, Dr. Virginia Sturm, a clinical psychologist who investigates autonomic and socioemotional deficits across distinct dementia syndromes; a second co-mentor, Dr. Manish Saggar, a computational neuroscientist developing computational methods to map dynamic brain activity in healthy and psychiatric populations; and a significant contributor, Dr. Isabel Allen, a statistician expert in machine-learning. This proposal describes the application of innovative techniques that aim to elucidate how the autonomic system and the brain dynamically interact to shape emotions and social behavior in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative syndromes. By leveraging the neuroanatomical and autonomic deficits found in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Dr. Pasquini seeks to identify the fundamental properties of neural systems underlying socioemotional well-being, with important implications for psychiatry where the neurobiology underlying affective disorders is not well understood. Dr. Pasquini will first delineate deficits in dynamic brain network organization in patients with bvFTD and explore the relationship to socioemotional symptoms (Aim 1). Dr. Pasquini will proceed by identifying deficits in dynamic autonomic outflow in patients with bvFTD and assess the neural correlates through separately acquired neuroimaging (Aim 2). Finally, Dr. Pasquini will capitalize on multimodal simultaneous acquisitions of autonomic outflow and brain network imaging acquired in healthy older controls to explore how both systems dynamically interact to sustain human emotions and social behavior (Exploratory Aim 3). The proposed training will allow Dr. Pasquini to develop a scientific niche and conduct his research with world-class mentorship, paving the way for his career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The neurobiological basis of socioemotional symptoms, a debilitating feature of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, is not well understood. The brain and autonomic nervous system cohesively interact to support socioemotional well-being, and cutting-edge analytical techniques can now reveal the rich dynamic properties of these systems. By leveraging behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease of socioemotional deficits that targets these systems, the goal of the proposed project is to determine how autonomic and functional brain network dynamics shape human emotions and social behavior in healthy and clinical populations.",Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function,10227218,K99AG065457,"['Affective Symptoms ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arousal ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Emotions ', ' Empathy ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Moods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Productivity ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Neurologist ', ' Shapes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' cohesion ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Regulation ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' fundamental research ', ' geriatric neuropsychiatry ', ' healthy aging ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' neural correlate ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia ', ' behavioral variant FTD ', ' behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration ', ' bvFTD ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2021,125010,CA-12
"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks. This project will make network neuroscientific tools available to new users via open science and cloud-computing.

"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10261581,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Foundations ', ' indexing ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Intercept ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' Child Behavioral Checklist ', ' Childhood Behavior Checklist ', ' Children Behavior Checklist ', ' Child Behavior Checklist ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Heritability ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' critical period ', ' effective intervention ', ' standardize measure ', ' longitudinal design ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' cognitive development ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' psychiatric genomics ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' Psychoses ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,420000,MA-08
"Multimodal monitoring and high-dimensional data for episode prediction in bipolar disorder SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder with high recurrence and disability rates, high economic burden, and an estimated suicide risk 20 times higher than the general population. While efficacious treatment is available, BD patients spend a large proportion of their life symptomatic. Predicting the onset of episodes is a valuable strategy to decrease suicide and disability rates and to optimize healthcare costs. The overall objective of this (R21) Exploratory/Developmental study is to obtain pilot data to support the feasibility and potential value of a new approach to predict mood episodes in stable adult patients with BD. This proposal aims to develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time. To do so, we propose integrating multimodal, high-dimensional telemonitoring data, nonlinear techniques and artificial intelligence classification systems. This approach builds on our preliminary work on: (i) nonlinear techniques for the study of mood regulation in BD; (ii) an award-winning simulation using a machine learning technique (Markov Brains) for episode prediction in BD. AIMS: Aim 1 (feasibility): To obtain and integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels in 90 euthymic BD adults. Exploratory Aim 2 (potential value): To use machine learning techniques (Markov Brains) to distinguish participants at higher risk for a depressive or manic relapse based on their time-series and entropy levels (from Aim 1). HYPOTHESES: H1: We will be able to collect enough data in 80% of our participants and to integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels. H2: Markov Brains will identify participants at higher risk for a mood episode based on high (vs. low) auto-correlated time-series and low (vs. high) entropy levels. SIGNIFICANCE: This R21 application challenges more traditional prediction models by conceptualizing inter- and intra-individual variability as a dynamic property of biological systems. By leveraging densely-sampled objective and subjective data, autonomic, clinical and demographic data, this proposal aims to develop inference techniques that will examine changes within each individual, over time, in order to enhance the estimation performance. Ultimately, if we develop the capacity to predict mood episodes, we should be able to prevent them. NARRATIVE The proposed research is clinically relevant as it could develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time, in order to predict mood changes indicative of an imminent episode of illness in bipolar disorder.

"Neuro-computational mechanisms of social learning and variation along psychiatric symptom dimensions and in autism PROJECT SUMMARY Social learning is key for acquiring knowledge about the world and for deciding how to act in social situations. By allowing individuals to learn the consequences of actions in the environment without having to directly experience them, social learning abilities are evolutionary advantageous. Yet they vary widely across individuals, and deficits are common in a number of disorders associated with impaired social function, such autism spectrum disorders. Autism affect nearly 2% of births in the US, and exhibits high comorbidity with other disorders, such as social anxiety. Symptoms in common include social withdrawal and difficulties navigating social interactions, and can cause challenges during clinical assessments and treatment decisions. To address these challenges, we need to provide a better characterization of the mechanisms underlying deficits in social function. This project aims to do so by developing a novel task battery assessing multiple aspects of social learning and an integrative neuro-computational framework dissecting the underlying mechanisms, both in the general population, in relation to symptom dimensions relevant to psychopathology (such as social anxiety), and in individuals with autism. During the K99 phase of the award, under the mentorship of Dr. John O’Doherty at Caltech, the candidate will receive training in advanced computational methods (with Dr. Yisong Yue), and in biological and clinical psychiatry (with Dr. Ralph Adolphs and Dr. Jamie Feusner). In Aim 1, the candidate will establish a hierarchical computational modelling framework to characterize social learning across a battery of three tasks - observational learning, social integration and dynamic trust learning. In Aim 2, a trans-diagnostic approach will be used in a large-scale online study to link individual differences in social learning computations with symptoms dimensions relevant to psychopathology, particularly autistic traits and social anxiety. During the R00 phase of the award, the candidate will combine her computational and psychiatry training to investigate social learning in individuals with autism and matched controls. Participants will complete the social learning task battery both behaviorally (Aim 3) and while undergoing fMRI (Aim 4). This will determine the task battery’s test-retest reliability, and identify social learning computations that are altered in autism and those that vary along relevant symptom dimensions identified in Aim 2. The fMRI findings will illuminate the neural computations and functional connectivity patterns associated with social learning and their alterations in autism. Using cutting-edge computational modelling and neuroimaging methods, this project will refine our understanding of social dysfunction and will contribute methodological and conceptual innovations to advance the burgeoning field of computational psychiatry. In the long term, such computational characterization of psychiatric deficits has the potential to inform policies and clinical interventions to improve social function. This Pathway to Independence award will allow the candidate to reach her training and research goals, form new collaborations, and overall paves the way for a successful transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to characterize the neuro-computational mechanisms that drive human social learning, and their alterations in relation to trans-diagnostic symptom dimensions relevant to psychopathology. Social learning computations will be examined both in the general population and in autism, a neuro-developmental disorder known to be associated with deficits in social function. In the long run, this research has the potential to inform the development of more tailored clinical assessments and interventions to improve social function in mental health.",Neuro-computational mechanisms of social learning and variation along psychiatric symptom dimensions and in autism,10216053,K99MH123669,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Belief ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Policies ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' news ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Transact ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social group ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' social communication ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' learning ability ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' social situation ', ' social anxiety ', ' cognitive ability ', ' social learning ', ' social media ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' autistic ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' individuals with autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic individuals ', ' individuals with ASD ', ' individuals with autism ', ' people with ASD ', ' people with autism ', ' people with autism spectrum disorder ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2021,97332,CA-27
"The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: Aprospective study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of adolescent mortality in the US. Rates of adolescent suicide have increased in recent years, along with the advent and growth of social media use (SMU) in this population. SMU has been linked with sleep disruption, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation (SI), all of which are precursors of suicidal behavior. Existing research on the impact of SMU on sleep, mood, and suicidality is limited by cross- sectional designs and self-reported measures of SMU and sleep. To advance the field, prospective designs are needed that include objective measures and intensive monitoring of high-risk samples to rigorously examine the temporal relationships between SMU and suicide risk, defined as depressed mood and SI. This K01 proposal uses precisely such a design to test a conceptual model in which SMU predicts sleep disruption, which, in turn, contributes to depressed mood and SI among adolescents. The proposed study will harness smartphone technology to assess SMU using real-time passive data capture, actigraphy, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in high-risk adolescents. These methods, combined with in-person study visits, will examine the temporal and unique within-person associations between SMU and sleep disruption (Aim 1), SMU and suicide risk (Aim 2), and test whether sleep disruption mediates the relationship between SMU and suicide risk (Aim 3). Data-driven approaches of supervised machine learning will leverage the high-dimensional, intensively- monitored data to identify key SMU features predictive of suicide risk in adolescents (Exploratory Aim). The candidate will build on her strong foundation in adolescent depression and sleep research by acquiring new conceptual and methodological training in: 1) adolescent suicide risk, 2) technology and mental health, including social media use and mobile technology for real-time assessment; and 3) advanced computational skills. The candidate has assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team to achieve her training goals within the exceptional environment of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Mentors (Brent and Moreno) are experts in adolescent suicide and social media, respectively, and both have had success in mentoring early career scientists. The candidate’s consultants have extensive expertise in adolescent development and EMA (Silk), adolescent sleep and actigraphy (Franzen), smartphone sensing (Ferreira) applied to clinical health (Low), and advanced statistical and machine learning approaches (Wallace). The proposed training and research will inform future R01 studies that use these innovative methods to identify and modify clinically-actionable risk factors, including SMU and sleep disruption, to attenuate near-term risk for adolescent suicide. This program of research has the potential to yield high-impact results that inform the development of suicide prevention programs that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time. The proposed research along with this training plan will uniquely position the candidate to be an independent investigator and leading scholar in the important public health problem of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescent suicide and suicidality have increased in recent years, which parallels the advent and rapid growth of social media use in adolescents’ daily lives. The proposed study will be the first in a broader program of research that leverages smartphone technology to examine how social media use impacts risk for the development and worsening of suicidal ideation and behavior among adolescents. This research program aims to identify modifiable risk factors, including social media use and sleep disruption, for adolescent suicide risk, and ultimately, contribute to the development of interventions that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time to prevent suicide.",The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: Aprospective study,10212954,K01MH121584,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' career ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Attenuated ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' ideation ', ' Scientist ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' sleep onset ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' Affective ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' high risk ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' clinically actionable ', ' social media ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' digital media ', ' high-risk adolescents ', ' secondary analysis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",K01,2021,157755,NJ-06
"Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Determining the mechanisms by which the human brain generates cognition, perception, and emotion hinges upon quantifying the relationships between coordinated brain activity and behavior. NIH-funded brain mapping initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Adolescent Cognitive and Behavioral Development (ABCD) study, have accelerated the production of large brain connectivity (i.e. connectome) and behavioral datasets. Contemporary connectome research views the brain as a large-scale, complex network composed of nonadjacent, yet connected brain regions. We propose to leverage the inherent network architecture of the connectome in order to probe fundamental biological mechanisms underlying the development of executive function and internalizing symptoms. In pursuit of this research question, this application proposes to formalize and validate in house analysis pipelines into a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox as a comprehensive, versatile tool for use in connectome-wide association studies. The proposed NLA toolbox fulfills BRAIN Initiative goal #5 to “Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools”. While the research focus of this career transition award is on the application of NLA to developmental mechanisms of executive function and emotion regulation, this versatile analytic tool will be transformative to connectome data analysis across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease. As part of tool development, the applicant will validate multiple NLA approaches using in silico connectome-behavior relationships and establish sensitivity and specificity of network level findings as compared to the connectome-wide control of familywise error rate (K99 Aim 1). The applicant will then establish test-retest reliability of NLA approaches using in vivo human connectome and behavioral data available from the HCP-Young Adult cohort (N=1105), and establish brain networks underlying healthy adult executive and emotional function (K99 Aim 2). During the independent R00 phase, she will then investigate changes in connectome architecture supporting the development of executive and emotional function using the ABCD longitudinal connectome and behavioral data (N=~11,000 age 9-14) (R00 Aim 3). During the K99 phase she will extend her training in behavioral neuroscience to include training in machine learning, longitudinal models, and computer science. Building on her strong foundation in human brain connectivity analysis, the applicant will gain advanced skills in biostatistics and best practices in software development to ensure her success as an independent researcher. The advisory committee, including Drs. Smyser (functional connectivity), Marcus (software engineering), Fair (developmental neuroscience), Todorov (biostatistics), Zhang (machine learning), Bassett (connectome analysis), Eggebrecht (toolbox development), and Barch (HCP/ABCD consultant) provide expertise in all core areas spanning experimental disciplines and possess an excellent record of obtaining independent funding and mentoring young scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE While significant research efforts have been devoted to determining the biological pathways of cognition and emotion, there is concern over the lack of reproducibility of findings. This proposal seeks to develop and apply a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox which will be used to identify and characterize the brain networks underlying healthy and disordered development of executive and emotional processes.

"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors.

"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology).

"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain CircuitsPD Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment

"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval - (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise.

"Evaluating overlap and distinctiveness in neurocomputational loss and reward elements of the RDoC matrix PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Evidence indicates that disruptions in loss and reward valuation exist across traditional psychiatric diagnostic categories, and these elements are featured in the NIMH Research Domain Criteria matrix. However, validating these features of the RDoC matrix and determining the translational utility of loss and reward valuation requires at least three critical advances: i) understanding the elements’ relational structure (i.e., to what extent are loss and reward valuation linked or distinct), ii) establishing the functional relevance of valuation measures (i.e., which features of loss and reward valuation are related to which symptoms), and iii) determining the stability or lack thereof of the elements and relationships between the elements (i.e., determining which valuation features are state-like vs trait-like). To work toward validating valuation elements and their relevance to psychopathology, we respond to RFA-MH-19-242 (Computational Approaches for Validating Dimensional Constructs of Relevance to Psychopathology). Specifically, we take a data-driven, computational psychiatry approach merging clinical and experimental data to delineate relationships among computationally derived components of loss and reward valuation and with symptoms in a large sample of participants with clinically significant mood, anxiety, or anhedonia (Aim 1). In Aims 2 and 3, we incorporate a mechanistic trial to assess whether components of and relationships between loss and reward valuation are sensitive to change a) over time, b) following 12 sessions of instructed valuation (Aim 2), or c) following cognitive behavioral therapy (Aim 3). If successful, we believe there is immense opportunity to bridge behaviorally-oriented clinicians and computational (neuro)scientists and advance the field by mapping symptoms to neuromechanistic disease processes and spurring the development of new neurobehaviorally- guided treatment approaches. As required by the RFA, this application assesses multiple constructs (loss and reward valuation constructs and learning subconstructs) in the Negative and Positive Valence RDoC domains, using multiple tasks and levels of data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Difficulties in how people respond to negative and positive outcomes (called `valuation') in our environment can be related to debilitating depression and anxiety. Here we use novel neuroscience and computational methods to study how links among depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, and different types of valuation vary over time and can be changed. This work may lead to new ways to understand the role of valuation in mental health and neuroscience-guided behavioral approaches for treating symptoms regardless of mental health diagnosis.",Evaluating overlap and distinctiveness in neurocomputational loss and reward elements of the RDoC matrix,10312509,R01MH127773,"['Anxiety ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' negative mood ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' arm ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptom treatment ', ' symptomatic treatment ', ' treat symptom ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,788923,VA-09
"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death

"Personalized Mapping of Affective Lability PROJECT SUMMARY Affective lability (AL) is a common psychiatric symptom characterized by rapid mood fluctuations. Clinically significant AL often begins in adolescence, is present in both psychiatric disorders and the general population, and is a major risk factor for suicide. However, the developmental substrates of AL remain only sparsely described. Prior studies have implicated deficits of top-down regulation between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the amygdala; the FPN is also known to undergo protracted maturation into young adulthood. However, previous efforts have been limited by methodological obstacles related to underlying biological heterogeneity of the FPN. Cortical networks have typically been studied using standardized network atlases, which assume a 1:1 mapping between structural and functional neuroanatomy across individuals. However, recent studies using precision functional mapping techniques have demonstrated reliable individual differences in functional topography, i.e., the spatial distribution of functional networks on the cortex. Notably, the FPN is both critical for affect regulation and also has the most variable functional topography of any cortical network. This proposal will capitalize upon new machine learning tools to map the FPN on a personalized basis to test the over-arching hypothesis that AL is associated with developmental abnormalities of FPN topography and connectivity. In Aim 1, we will continue to acquire a sample of 30 adolescents and young adults (ages 16-21) with affective lability and 20 matched comparators using smartphone-based digital phenotyping and multi- modal imaging. In Aim 2, we will capitalize upon a recently-completed longitudinal study (n=200, 10-25 years old, mean follow up interval = 5 years) that will allow us to understand how longitudinal changes in personalized FPN topography and connectivity associate with AL. Taken together, this project will provide valuable new insights regarding circuit-level developmental deficits associated with AL, and provide the candidate with superb training in computational psychiatry.

"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,10130001,R01MH116652,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computers ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Risk ', ' Shame ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' impression ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' suicidal individual ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' neural patterning ', ' clinical practice ', ' longitudinal design ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' recruit ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' classification algorithm ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,728998,PA-18
"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these “real-time” pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical “roadblock” with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,10084718,R01MH119430,"['absorption ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eyebrow structure ', ' Eyebrows ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Oxyhemoglobin ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Smiling ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' deoxyhemoglobin ', ' T-state hemoglobin ', ' de-oxyhemoglobin ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' emotional reaction ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' mimicry ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Head Movements ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' magnetic field ', ' dyadic interaction ', ' contagion ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Imaging technology ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' neural correlate ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,399738,CT-03
"Neural sensitivity to social evaluation and daily online and in-person social experience with peers: Predicting fluctuations in suicidality, self-harm, and depressive symptoms in adolescent girls PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rates of suicide, self-harm, and depression are alarmingly high among adolescent girls, with a dramatic spike over the last decade, yet it is not clear which girls are at highest risk for these serious problems and when they might escalate. Some have argued that the dramatic rise in social media (SM) use may play a role, but more rigorous data are needed to evaluate the positive and negative effects of SM use in adolescent girls. Sensitivity to social evaluation, such as rejection or exclusion, is a potential cross-diagnostic risk factor for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB; including suicidal ideation and behavior and nonsuicidal self-injury) and de- pressive symptoms (DEPsx). This study examines how socially threatening and rewarding peer interactions— experienced online or in-person—contribute to real-time fluctuations in SITB, DEPsx, and well-being. The first aim is to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify how adolescent girls’ daily subjective experi- ence of online and in-person social threat and reward predict proximal within-person changes and longer-term between-person differences in SITB and DEPsx, along with wellbeing. The sample will include 177 adolescent girls (ages 13-17), with 75% of the sample at high-risk for suicide (e.g. active ideation within past 6 weeks, at- tempt in past year, or ≥ five episodes of nonsuicidal self-injury in past year), with at least half of high-risk par- ticipants also reporting elevated DEPsx. Girls will complete three 10-day bursts of EMA and will also provide access to passively obtained data on SM use and digital social interactions (i.e. text, video-chat). Multilevel modeling analyses will be used to identify predictors of near-term changes in SITB, DEPsx, and positive affect (PA), as well as long-term outcomes assessed at 6- and 12-month follow-up. A second aim is to identify which girls are at highest risk for DEPsx and/or SITB when exposed to near-term precipitants, focusing on differences in brain activation to social evaluation within an affective salience network (ASN) that includes the amygdala, anterior insula, dorsal and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Building on the differ- ential susceptibility to context theory, the study proposes that heightened ASN activation to social evaluation is a susceptibility factor that could amplify both the positive and negative effects of daily social experience on SITB and DEPsx. Girls will complete neuroimaging tasks that assess brain response to social evaluation from virtual peers. It is hypothesized that within-person increases and higher rates of peer social threat experiences (online and in-person) will be most strongly associated with SITB and DEPsx for girls with heightened ASN activation to social evaluation, and that within-person increases and higher rates of peer social reward experi- ences will also be more strongly associated with PA/wellbeing and more protective against SITB and DEPsx for girls with heightened ASN activation to social evaluation. Finally, machine learning will be used to determine which objective features of SM use track in real-time with subjective experience and emotional health, and to identify the strongest set of predictors of short-term and long-term emotional health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Results from this study could help address the current mental health crisis among adolescent girls by leverag- ing real-time data to identify near-term risk factors that more optimally predict when girls will experience esca- lations in suicidality, as well as common earlier precursors to suicide such as nonsuicidal self-injury and de- pressive symptoms, and leveraging neuroimaging data to identify which girls may be at highest risk. This infor- mation is critical for improving real-time risk detection, designing just-in-time suicide prevention and inter- vention approaches, and accelerating the discovery of potential neural markers of risk and/or protection from these serious emotional health problems. Additionally, the study will provide rigorous empirical data on the real-time positive and negative links between social media use and adolescent emotional health that can inform public perceptions and policies surrounding social media use among adolescents.","Neural sensitivity to social evaluation and daily online and in-person social experience with peers: Predicting fluctuations in suicidality, self-harm, and depressive symptoms in adolescent girls",10298070,R01MH124866,"['Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Buffers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Puberty ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Policies ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' ward ', ' Address ', ' video chat ', ' video conferencing ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Marker ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Text ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' high risk ', ' non-suicidal self injury ', ' nonsuicidal self injury ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' social media ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,837750,PA-18
"Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding ABSTRACT Hoarding Disorder (HD), recognized as an independent illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for less than a decade, is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts. Emerging data shows that hoarding severity correlates with substantial medical burden. Prevalence of clinically significant hoarding behavior is estimated to be between 2 and 4%, with a higher burden in the older population. However, it is believed that hoarding disorder is underdiagnosed. The parent R01MH117114 combines in-person clinical, neuropsychological, and medical frailty assessments with a unique epidemiologic resource, the online Brain Health Registry (BHR) 17, to assess the extent of disability in older adults suffering with hoarding symptoms. To date, over 24,000 subjects have taken hoarding-related questionnaires. In addition, 1554 participants have completed additional surveys performed for validation of hoarding symptoms. Moreover, the BHR includes longitudinal objective and subjective measures of cognition, as well as childhood and medical history. We will classify longitudinal trends of measures of hoarding symptomatology in a subpopulation of the BHR with clinical assessments of hoarding disorders and other psychopathologies. We will then project the whole BHR population to classify longitudinal trends. We will then apply statistical inference and techniques from artificial intelligence to identify predictors of various trends of hoarding symptomatology to find predictors of developing severe hoarding symptoms. Ongoing recruitment through the parent R01 will allow for validation of the predictions made through this work. Moreover, as there is a rapid increase in the number of psychiatric studies using web-based data collection methods rather than in-person clinical assessments, the importance of studying the temporal trends and fidelity of these data collection methods extends beyond the scope of the current study. The present study will provide a proof-of-concept approach for analyzing such data.  The work will be carried out by a trained mathematician transitioning into systems medicine whose career goal is to establish an independent career in the field of computational psychiatry. The training provided through this grant will prepare the supplement candidate to submit an independent K01 award on the interactions between late life depression and hoarding disorder to the National Institute of Mental Health. This will be done by providing tailored mentoring by experts in hoarding disorder and systems medicine, access to unique datasets related to various psychopathologies, structured training in grant writing and responsible conduct in research, a structured course in psychopathology, and premier computational resources at the University of Florida.

"Disrupted neural synchrony during naturalistic perception in schizophrenia: Toward a new biomarker of social dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Social dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia. Many individuals with schizophrenia experience social disconnection, a lack of social contact with friends and family. Social disconnection is associated with reduced quality of life and many negative health effects, but most current treatments do little to address it. The development of new interventions is currently hindered by a lack of scientific understanding about how differences in the way individuals’ brains process information contribute to social disconnection, and a lack of biomarkers associated with social functioning. Recent research in non-clinical social neuroscience points to a compelling model that may help to explain social disconnection in schizophrenia and would provide the basis for a new biomarker of social dysfunction. Specifically, research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis methods shows that people whose brains tend to respond more normatively to dynamic, naturalistic stimuli (e.g., video clips) tend to have more social connections, perhaps because more other people experience the world in a similar way, whereas people with less normative responses tend to have fewer social connections. Converging evidence suggests that many individuals with schizophrenia are likely to have less normative responses to such naturalistic stimuli, which could help to explain why social disconnection is common in the disorder. However, the ISC method has not yet been used to study social dysfunction in schizophrenia. This project will fill this research gap by translating ISC research methods from non-clinical research in order to investigate how ISCs relate to social disconnection in schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia (N=200) and matched healthy controls (N=100) will each complete one fMRI scan during which they will view naturalistic video stimuli and complete two established paradigms that assess important domains of social processing: social cue perception and mentalizing. We will characterize ISCs based on responses to the naturalistic video stimuli and characterize brain activity related to social cue perception and mentalizing using standard analyses. The study will test whether ISCs differ between the two participant groups and evaluate to what extent group ISC differences relate to individual differences in social connection. We will also characterize ISC normativity for each member of the schizophrenia group, using the control group as a reference, to assess whether brain response normativity is associated with social disconnection, and whether individuals’ degree of social disconnection can be predicted from it. The project will also test whether an ISC-based measure is more sensitive to individual differences in social disconnection than established fMRI measures. Results from this project will improve understanding of how brain activity relates to social dysfunction in schizophrenia. ISC measures are also expected to constitute a biomarker of social dysfunction that may be useful for identifying individuals at high risk of social disconnection, targeting treatments toward individuals most likely to benefit from them, or assessing outcomes in future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will advance understanding of social dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is a core feature of the disorder that is associated with reduced quality of life and many negative health outcomes. By applying a novel research technique from non-clinical social neuroscience, this study will characterize specific relationships between patterns of brain activity and degree of social disconnection in schizophrenia.

A history of prior self-injury, including both nonsuicidal self- injury and suicidal self-injury (e.g., suicide attempts), has been consistently found to be the strongest predictor of future suicidal behavior, with evidence suggesting that the more severe such behaviors are, the greater the risk for future self-injury. Importantly, however, our current means of assessing severity of prior self-injury is almost entirely reliant on self-report, despite the fact that self-injury frequently leaves tangible physical markings. Although applications of machine learning in medical image analysis are growing exponentially, none have attempted to augment suicide risk detection through automated analysis of self-directed tissue damage. Leveraging computer vision to automatically assess images of tissue damage has the potential to obviate complete reliance on subjective patient report of self-injury severity characteristics. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to utilize computer vision techniques to automate the assessment of hypothesized self-injury visual severity indicators, learn new visual severity indicators, and determine the utility of these visual signals in predicting prospective suicide attempt risk. Community adolescents ages 16 to 18 years old will be recruited on Facebook and Instagram if they have currently visible physical marking(s) secondary to self-injury. Participants will securely upload images of markings secondary to intentional self-injury. A subset of participants will be followed longitudinally for three months to assess prospective suicide attempts. We will employ deep convolutional neural networks, a class of artificial neural networks, to develop algorithms to detect severity indices of self-injury and to examine their accuracy in predicting short-term prospective suicide risk. We will assess the generalizability of a subset of algorithms by applying them to a separate clinical sample of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents ages 16 to 18 years old. This proof-of-concept study will set the stage to determine the feasibility of pursuing our long-term goal of integrating this technology into psychiatric care entry-points (e.g., emergency departments, inpatient units) to assess whether this technology can augment current suicide risk assessment models and in turn, serve as a clinical decision-support tool to help clinicians assess suicide risk. This research is significant in that it aligns with the NIMH/National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention’s Aspirational Goal 2 of determining suicide risk in diverse populations and settings using feasible and effective assessment approaches, and Goal 3 of finding novel ways to assess for imminent suicide risk, given that our target prediction period is three months. Project Narrative This application aims to determine whether a computer can analyze pictures of skin damage from adolescents who engage in self-injury and predict who is at risk for making a suicide attempt in the future. Results from this work may help in the development of a clinical decision-support tool to help clinicians assess suicide risk in medical care settings.",Leveraging Computer Vision to Augment Suicide Risk Prediction,10285809,R21MH127231,"['Hospitalized Adolescent ', ' Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mole the mammal ', ' Moles ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Secondary to ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Self Perception ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' cutaneous tissue ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' Skin ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Sum ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' suicidal individual ', ' high risk ', ' non-suicidal self injury ', ' nonsuicidal self injury ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' support tools ', ' Self-Direction ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' recruit ', ' clinical decision support ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' Facebook ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' automated analysis ', ' infection risk ', ' skin damage ', ' cutaneous damage ', ' dermal damage ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2021,265545,MA-08
"Discovering prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers of the psychosis spectrum using network control theory PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia, and other disorders of the psychosis spectrum (PS), most commonly emerge throughout development and are thought to be caused by disruptions to normative brain maturation occurring during this time. Critically, deviations from normative neurodevelopment are thought to precede the emergence of clinically significant PS symptoms by several years, highlighting the profound impact that their discovery would have for psychiatry research; if we can successfully identify the antecedent brain abnormalities, then we may be able to intervene early and reduce the risk of individuals developing schizophrenia. Uncovering these antecedent brain abnormalities requires predictive models built upon recent advances in network neuroscience and machine learning; moreover, such models must be coupled with large samples of longitudinal neuroimaging and clinical data to uncover truly prognostic biomarkers. Finally, sex differences are found in both the PS symptoms and neurodevelopment. Thus, studies that provide a precise understanding of how sex interacts with PS symptoms and abnormal neurodevelopment are needed. The purpose of the current study is to use advanced tools from network neuroscience and machine learning coupled with multi-modal neuroimaging to uncover biomarkers that can predict the emergence of PS symptoms throughout development. To achieve this goal, we will draw on multiple largescale cross-sectional and longitudinal neurodevelopmental datasets, including the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, the Healthy Brain Network, and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, to study brain structure and connectivity. We use Network Control Theory (NCT) to study connectivity. NCT treats the brain as a dynamical system allowing us to probe a region's capacity to control changes in brain states via white matter pathways. Compared to graph theory, NCT is a contemporary approach that posits an explicit model of how the brain's structure informs and constrains its function, enabling mechanistic insight into the dysconnectivity associated with the PS. We will quantify developmental abnormalities in NCT metrics using a nascent machine learning technique known as normative modeling. A normative model builds a growth chart of brain development that incorporates the expected variation in the relationship between age and the brain into its predictions. Then, deviations from these growth charts can be understood in terms of what is and what is not expected in a normative population. Here, we will build cross-sectional (Aim 1) and longitudinal (Aim 2) normative models of NCT metrics and use multivariate deviations to predict PS symptoms out-of-sample. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate the extent to which deviations from normative neurodevelopment mediate the relationship between sex and PS symptoms. The goal of this Pathway to Independence award is to build on my strong background in psychiatry, multimodal neuroimaging, network neuroscience, and machine learning by expanding my expertise to developmental psychopathology, NCT, and longitudinal neuroimaging data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will uncover the abnormalities in brain development that precede and predict the emergence of psychosis spectrum symptoms in youth. A detailed understand of such antecedent brain abnormalities is critical for early identification and intervention of disorders related to the psychosis spectrum, such as schizophrenia. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of psychosis-related disorders on individuals and society at large.",Discovering prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers of the psychosis spectrum using network control theory,10284489,K99MH127296,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Delusions ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hallucinations ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Graph ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' Property ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Clinical Data ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' network models ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' cognitive development ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' control theory ', ' graph theory ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' biological sex ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Psychoses ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2021,109778,PA-03
"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of

"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,10223999,U01MH115727,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' California ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Microglia ', ' Hortega cell ', ' gitter cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' microglial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Scientist ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Test Result ', ' Penetrance ', ' human data ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' protein expression ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Data ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' cost ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' analytical tool ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' stem cell biology ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' genetic information ', ' Genetic study ', ' Data Science ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' ']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2021,4026586,MA-07
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation.

"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10186744,U24EB029005,"['Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Correlations ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Peer Review ', ' Production ', ' Psychologist ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' image processing ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Training ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' brain cell ', ' success ', ' supercomputer ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Data ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' tool development ', ' data sharing ', ' operation ', ' collaborative environment ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' peer-group environment ', ' webinar ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' Wait Time ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,377473,CA-52
"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,10150848,R01EB026549,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Emotions ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Charon ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' model development ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' population based ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' translational impact ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,653664,MD-07
"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive. The results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in hearing and communication deficits as well as in disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Our research program pursues a better theoretical understanding of this crucial cognitive function using advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods, validated using intracranial recordings in pre-surgical patients. Our results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.",Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity,10105316,R01DC016915,"['Laboratory Animals ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Perceptual Disorders ', ' perception disorder ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' base ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Hearing problem ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' auditory disease ', ' auditory disorder ', ' auditory dysfunction ', ' auditory problem ', ' hearing disease ', ' tool ', ' electric field ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Auditory ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' vocalization ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Dyslexia ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Central Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' semantic processing ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' operation ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,599963,MA-08
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",10164860,R01MH100155,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Institutes ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Glean ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' suicidal youth ', ' high risk ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Positive Valence ', ' prospective test ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,718829,PA-18
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets these needs with well-documented and tested novel analyses using MEG and EEG in

"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis.

"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,10054973,R01MH115922,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cognition ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Distal ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' respiratory ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' Affective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Social Processes ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Self-Direction ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' recruit ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,670430,PA-18
"Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores ABSTRACT Suicide is a leading cause of death that continues to increase, with over 47,000 preventable suicide deaths per year in the U.S. Although we have made great strides in using electronic health records (EHR) and other factors to predict suicidal ideation and behavior, our ability to reliably predict suicide death is close to zero. From a healthcare standpoint, predicting suicide deaths is tricky. We know that the incidence of suicide behaviors is far more common (~4%-5% per year) compared to suicide death (~0.01%-0.02% per year). Essentially, only a small fraction of those who engage in suicidal behaviors will go on to die by suicide. Knowledge of who these highest risk individuals are is critically important in directing prevention efforts and development of future targeted interventions. In addition, well over half of suicide deaths occur with no prior attempts, even accounting for lack of documentation of attempts in diagnostic codes. These “out of the blue” cases suggest one or more high-risk groups even more elusive to accurate prediction and prevention. Including genetic data of suicide deaths may offer substantial predictive improvement; genetic factors account for close to 50% of the risk of suicide death. Using the extensive genetic data, statewide longitudinal EHR resources, demographic, and familial data available to the Utah Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS), we are uniquely poised to address this critical knowledge gap. Our primary focus will be to use machine learning methods develop models that predict suicide deaths. In addition, our large suicide death research resource will also allow us to model differences of suicide deaths with vs. without prior attempts. Of the ~9,000 Utah suicide deaths with demographics and environmental data, familial data, and 2 decades of longitudinal EHR data, the USGRS also currently has DNA from >6,000, which will increase to ~10,000 during the award period. Genome- wide molecular data is in hand for over 5,000 of these Utah suicides, allowing for tests of association of suicide subtypes identified using EHR data with “genetic phenotypes” represented by polygenic risk scores. The USGRS also has demographics, familial data, and longitudinal EHR data from 5 age/sex- matched Utah population controls for each suicide death, allowing for comparisons of non-lethal attempts to suicide deaths. In addition, we will collaborate with colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who are currently developing EHR and polygenic risk models to study substance use disorder, anxiety, and major depressive disorder in 37,510 participants in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biorepository. They will expand this work to include suicidality to provide an additional resource of suicide attempt for our model development and testing. We will additionally study polygenic risk scores associated with suicide death vs. attempt using our resources, Mount Sinai BioMe, and a collaboration with Vanderbilt University for access to their Biobank and to suicide attempts in the UK Biobank.. Independent validation will be possible through genotyping of new Utah suicides collected throughout the project, with additional comparisons to attempt cases in large datasets available through the PsychEMERGE consortium. NARRATIVE We will develop and validate models to predict suicide death, as distinct from suicide attempt, using electronic health records (EHR), demographics, environmental stresses, familial risks, and genetic differences. We will use 9,000 Utah suicides with longitudinal EHR data (>5,000 of these with molecular data growing to 10,000 by the end of the study), Utah population controls, collaborations with Mount Sinai Medical School and Vanderbilt University, and validation/replication with the large EHR and molecular data resources in the PsychEMERGE Consortium.",Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores,10239191,R01MH123489,"['Accounting ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Hand ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Medical Examiners ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Population Control ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' environmental stresses ', ' environmental stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' comparison group ', ' comparator group ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' data resource ', ' early life stress ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,688954,UT-02
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics Electroencephalography (EEG), the first function brain activity imaging modality, has several natural advantages over metabolic brain imaging modalities. EEG is noninvasive, low cost, and lightweight enough to be highly mobile. Two major shifts in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data are now ongoing. The first is a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution cortical source imaging modality. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began as a set of EEG data analysis running on Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now nearly twenty years later, the EEGLAB reference paper [4] has over 6,750 citations (now increasing by over 4 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links 6,000 researchers, the EEGLAB news list over 15,000 researchers, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. Our statistics show that after over the past four years, EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will develop a framework for thorough comparison of preprocessing methods, and will apply machine learning methods on the large body of data collected by our laboratory to build optimized, automated data processing pipelines. We will greatly augment the power of the EEGLAB environment by providing a cross-study meta-analysis capability and will revise the software architecture to use a file and metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) framework first developed for fMRI/MRI data archiving. These tools will integrate the HED annotating system allowing for meta-analysis across large corpus of studies. We will implement beamforming within EEGLAB. We will develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective sources on multiple measures across subjects and studies, and will develop tools to perform statistical testing on information flow measures at these scales. Although EEG and MEG recording have co- existed for four decades, little available software can combine both data types, recorded concurrently (`MEEG' data), to enhance source separation. We recently showed that ICA decomposition also allows joint MEEG effective source decomposition and will integrate MEG and joint MEEG data decomposition and imaging into the EEGLAB tool set. We will build tools to use MRI- and fMRI-derived anatomical atlases to inform the interpretation of EEG and MEG brain source dynamics. These radical improvements will further the use of non-invasive human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging in the U.S. and worldwide, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electromagnetic dynamics. The EEGLAB signal processing environment is now used in many electrophysiological research and teaching laboratories worldwide. To accelerate progress in basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience, we will continue maintenance and development of the EEGLAB environment, introducing new tools for source separation and localization, source clustering, automatic artifact management, and across-studies meta-analysis, and will extend its scope to process magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and joint EEG/MEG data and to highlight parallels between EEG/MEG source dynamics and results of existing research using fMRI and other brain imaging.",EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain

"Development and clinical interpretation of machine learning emergency department suicide prediction algorithms using electronic health records and claims Project Summary  Preventing suicide is one of the great public health challenges facing the US health care system. People who seek emergency care for mental health complaints are at high short-term risk of non-fatal suicide events and suicide. Yet identifying high-risk patients is challenging as risk fluctuates in a poorly understood manner. It is especially difficult to evaluate risk in emergency settings, where access to the patient's mental health history is often limited. The proposed project seeks to address this critical knowledge gap by pairing data mining and machine learning methods with rich data sources in order to develop short-term prediction models of non-fatal suicidal events and suicide for patients presenting to EDs with mental health problems.  The specific aims of this study are to 1) apply advanced machine learning data analytic techniques to electronic health record (EHR) data to develop a clinically rich description of ED mental health patient characteristics that predict suicide and non-fatal suicidal events over a 90- day follow-up period; 2) use longitudinal and temporal features of EHR and claims data from the 180 days preceding the ED mental health visit to generate clinically interpretable suicide and suicidal event risk scores; and 3) convene ED physicians to enhance model development, clinical interpretability, and utility of a suicide risk assessment clinical decision support tool.  We will achieve these aims by leveraging several different sophisticated machine learning analytic methods of existing longitudinal clinical and service use information. We seek to develop point-in-time, short-term risk scores for suicidal symptoms and suicide death and the clinical features that drive that risk that may be used to inform clinical risk assessment and management of patients who present to EDs with mental health complaints. Risk algorithms will be developed and validated using health information from a large combined EHR and claims dataset with over 24 million commercially insured patients, which is linked to the National Death Index. Findings will yield new insights regarding patient-specific risk factors and potential targets for intervention. By drawing on data sources common to most health care systems and using efficient computer algorithms this approach has the potential to develop clinically interpretable suicide risk scores at the point of ED evaluation and following disposition. This will help front- line clinicians focus their efforts on high risk patients during high risk periods to inform intervention decisions about suicide risk. Project Narrative Although patients with mental disorders who present to emergency departments have over a 30-fold increased odds of suicide, most are not identified as at risk during these visits. This project will apply machine learning methods to electronic health records and medical claims in order to develop and evaluate point-in-time short- term longitudinal suicide risk algorithms for patients presenting to the emergency department with mental health complaints. This new knowledge will provide emergency department clinicians with interpretable, patient-specific information about short-term risk of suicide attempts and suicide.",Development and clinical interpretation of machine learning emergency department suicide prediction algorithms using electronic health records and claims,10277514,R01MH126895,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Crisis Intervention ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk Management ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' trait ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Provider ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Emergency Care ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Output ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical risk ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Department evaluation ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' support tools ', ' Data Analytics ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' emergency settings ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' clinical encounter ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,784177,PA-03
"Leveraging deep learning and clinical notes for surveillance and prediction of intentional self-harm and suicide PROJECT SUMMARY: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. The identification of individuals at risk for suicide is an important step for a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention. Despite extensive research on risk factors for intentional self-harm and suicide, prospective prediction of suicide remains a difficult task with poor predictive power. Recent studies suggest that new machine learning methods applied to electronic health records (EHR) show promising results. However, more advanced computational approaches such as deep learning, have not been fully leveraged in this field, especially in the area of advanced methods for text classification of clinical notes. Our aims in this project, are to improve the phenotyping of suicidal behavior, and the prediction of future suicidal behavior and suicide deaths by integrating mortality data with EHR data and leveraging state-of-the-art natural language computational approaches. We will also investigate methods for explain ability and interpretability of the models to improve future adoption by clinicians. We will validate our models by examining reproducibility and generalizability across two health systems using similar data at both sites. Project Narrative Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year.

"Sex-Specific Functional Connectivity Changes in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to develop sex-specific resting state fMRI biomarkers for major depressive disorder (MDD) and to determine their underlying genetic correlates. Our primary aim is to determine the locations and the degree of sex-specific functional connectivity differences associated with MDD patients as compared to healthy subjects, and to test whether those sex-specific connectivity differences define sex-specific subtypes of MDD. The benefit of achieving these goals will be twofold: (1) in the clinic, achieving these goals will allow for more accurate diagnostic and treatment-response predictive algorithms for MDD, to reduce time to remission in MDD patients. (2) In the laboratory, our work will guide discovery of novel sex-specific circuit mechanisms and treatments for MDD. Our second aim is to determine if sex-specific MDD effects on connectivity can be predicted by regional gene expression in the brain. Investigating the relationship between brain gene expression and MDD effects on functional connectivity would implicate novel genes in the circuit mechanism of MDD and identify genes that interact with sex in driving MDD symptomatology. To achieve these aims, we will use parametric and non-parametric statistical testing to define sex-specific functional connectivity differences between depressed and healthy men, and between depressed and healthy women. Secondary analyses will test whether sex-specific classifiers for differentiating MDD subjects and healthy controls (“diagnostic biomarkers”) outperform classifiers trained on all subjects independent of sex. To identify genetic correlates of sex-specific MDD effects on functional connectivity, we will use the multivariate technique of partial least squares regression to locate linear combinations of genes which can predict MDD-related connectivity differences in males and in females. Finally, to identify sex-specific subtypes of MDD, we will use a combination of regularized canonical correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering in a validated method for subtype discovery previously published in Dr. Conor Liston’s lab. This project will fill a substantial gap in our knowledge of sex differences in MDD functional connectivity and the underlying genetic correlates of those differences. This project will also involve the execution of a concrete training plan to allow me to develop concrete technical skills in fMRI analysis and machine learning techniques, conceptual skill in hypothesis testing, data interpretation, and scientific communication, and clinical competency as a licensed physician, all under the guidance and mentorship of the project’s sponsor Dr. Liston and co-sponsor Dr. Francis Lee, who are both accomplished physician-scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been cited as the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting up to 14.2 million patients in the United States per year, and contributing to over 47,000 suicides per year. Most patients experience a delay in reaching remission due to a lack of precise treatment selection methods. Our goal is to apply a biomarker-driven approach of precision medicine in psychiatry, using machine learning tools to analyze human neuroimaging and genetic data, with the clinical endpoint of shortened time to remission for MDD patients.",Sex-Specific Functional Connectivity Changes in Major Depressive Disorder,10235389,F30MH124317,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', '

"Linking VA and non-VA data to study the risk of suicide in chronic pain patients. PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate large-scale VA and non-VA data across New York, Chicago and Florida to study the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and accidental opioid overdose deaths in Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT). PROJECT ABSTRACT Opioid misuse and its associated risks of suicide is a national public health emergency. Current estimates suggest that chronic pain impacts nearly half of Veterans, and studies have shown that people who experience chronic pain are at increased risk for a number of adverse health outcomes, including suicide and opioid overdose. Although multiple national initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have attempted to decrease the number of veterans with opioid prescriptions for pain management, these efforts focus on analyzing VA data only. Given that many Veterans receive care and treatment from non-VA community clinics and medical centers, it is imperative to study suicide or accidental overdose risk amongst Veterans with pain disorders by analyzing both VA and non-VA data.

"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10238174,R00MH120257,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Glean ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' interest ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' movie ', ' Categories ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intramural Program ', ' Intramural Research Program ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Stress Tests ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' emotional stimulus ', ' data acquisition ', ' brain behavior ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' anxious ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' mood symptom ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2021,249000,NH-02
"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home. This is a first step toward development of a safe, accurate, potentially scalable online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals. Project Narrative (Relevance) Bereaved individuals, and particularly those bereaved by suicide and who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder, are at substantially elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts. This project, applying machine learning techniques to detect suicidal attempt risk among bereaved individuals using an online bereavement resource, the Living Memory Home, is a first step in the development of a safe and effective online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals.",Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals,10077375,R21MH121886,"['Bereavement ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Future ', ' Grief reaction ', ' Grief ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' suicide model ', ' expressive writing ', ' expressive writing therapy ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicidal individual ', ' loved ones ', ' primary outcome ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' informal support ', ' web-based tool ', ' recruit ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2021,206083,NY-12
"Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Key focus: Research leveraging EHR data (PAR-18-929) to prevent suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) Objectives: To use augmented Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR data to develop Personalized Treatment Rules (PTRs) to help guide clinicians in making key treatment decisions for mentally ill patients aimed at reducing SRBs over the next 12 months. Specific aims: We will focus on two decisions: the decision of primary care physicians on how to treat patients coming to them for help with common mental disorders (CMD; “the PCP study”); and the decision of VHA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on whether to hospitalize patients who just made nonfatal suicide attempts or treat them as outpatients (“the SPC study”). Both are recognized as critical decisions, with no globally optimal treatment path for either and little guidance on how to decide among the treatment options. Research design: We will use a prospective observational design. The PCP study will be based on EHR data for the roughly 583,000 incident PCP visits of VHA patients for help with a CMD in 2010-2016. An incident visit will be defined as where the patient had not received other CMD treatment in the prior 12 months. The five broad PCP treatment options are pharmacotherapy, referral to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus measurement based collaborative care, and referral to a psychiatrist. The outcomes will be either an SRB (the primary outcome, either suicide death or administratively-recorded nonfatal suicide attempt) over the next 12 months or psychiatric hospitalization with suicidality over the same follow-up period (the secondary outcome). These outcomes occurred after 12,292 2010-2016 incident visits. The SPC study will be based on the 67,196 2010-2016 VHA Suicide Behavior Reports completed after a nonfatal VHA outpatient suicide attempt. Roughly half of these cases were hospitalized and the others treated as outpatients. A repeat SRB occurred over the next 12 months for 19,829 of these cases. Methods: A best-practice method of balancing baseline covariates will be used to adjust for nonrandom assignment across treatment options. Baseline covariates will include: prior EHR data; EHR data available for the focal treatment decision, including information abstracted from clinical notes with natural language processing; small-area geocode data for patient addresses; individual-level data from the LexisNexis Social Determinants of Health Database on patient finances, employment, marital status, and criminal justice involvement; and information about prior practice patterns of treating clinicians and practices-resources of treatment settings. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to analyze these weighted data to develop PTRs. Cross-validation in the 2010-2016 data and validation in 2017-2018 data (not available until the third year of the study) will be used to estimate out-of-sample performance of the PTRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop precision treatment rules for (i) primary care physicians trying to develop a treatment plan for patients seeking treatment for common mental disorders and (ii) suicide prevention coordinators trying to develop a treatment plan for a patient who just made a nonfatal suicide attempt with the goal of developing a plan that will minimize prevalence of suicide-related behaviors (either suicide deaths or nonfatal attempts) over the next 12 months. The work will be carried out in the Veterans Health Administration system, but will have implications for the broader population. The research has the potential to have great public health significance given that suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) are important public health problems, that the decisions we will study occur very often and have important effects on SRBs, that clinicians currently have no clear guidance on how to make these decisions, and that the design we propose to use has a high probability of success because of a number of important advantages over the designs used in previous studies.",Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related

"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,10138024,R01MH112560,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cues ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Future ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Psychologist ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Training ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Social Processes ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' affective computing ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,249264,CA-18
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,10061648,R01MH121455,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Neuroses ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' neurotic ', ' neuroticism ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Country ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genetic association ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' clinical risk ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Genetic study ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' genetic architecture ', ' structured data ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,543736,TN-05
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,10053729,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cues ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Emotions ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' expectation ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' emotional experience ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' neural network ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,682901,NY-13
"Penn Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center This proposal is to develop the University of Pennsylvania’s Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center. Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US that disproportionately affects minority and disenfranchised populations, including Blacks, Hispanics and sexual/gender minorities. Yet, these groups often are not included in suicide prevention research. Guided by a conceptual model based on the Integrated Behavior Model, which posits that organizational culture, policies, and resources (or lack thereof) impact the provider’s attributes and behaviors, INSPIRE brings together psychology, implementation science, health economics, machine learning, health information technology, psychiatry and participatory research experts to apply innovative interdisciplinary approaches to suicide prevention. INSPIRE’s overarching goals are to develop and adapt practice-based and other suicide prevention interventions for underserved groups and to design and test implementation strategies to optimize how evidence-based practices can be brought to scale efficiently and with high fidelity, for optimal effectiveness. INSPIRE will prioritize strategies that can be rapidly deployed in a range of practice settings, including those with limited resources, thereby increasing their reach and public health impact. Penn INSPIRE will use state-of-the-science methods from participatory research to actively engage stakeholders from many sectors – including patients, providers, and payers – at every level of its work to accomplish its Specific Aims. INSPIRE will apply innovative, interdisciplinary behavior change and implementation science methods to develop, adapt, and evaluate cost effective interventions. A Signature Project will use a stepped wedge study design to test an innovative organizational strategy that leverages telehealth to deliver high quality Safety Planning Intervention and follow-up services in Emergency Departments. Three Exploratory Projects will test novel strategies for suicide prevention across individual, clinician, and organizational levels and with specific vulnerable populations that will lay the foundation for more definitive studies. INSPIRE will also support 10 pilot projects and an innovative Methods Core that will develop and test new methods to advance research at the intersection of suicide prevention and implementation science. The Suicide Prevention Scholars Program will expand the cadre of suicide prevention researchers by engaging both emerging investigators and established scientists who do not currently work on suicide prevention – particularly those from groups under-represented in research – through content, design. and methodological mentoring and capacity-building. By catalyzing interdisciplinary, cross-sector collaborations and advancing suicide prevention research, care, and policy both locally and nationally, we will develop cost-effective, practical, and efficient ways to implement evidence-based suicide prevention interventions. INSPIRE is poised to be transformational for suicide prevention. The University of Pennsylvania Innovation In Suicide Prevention Implementation Research (INSPIRE) Center’s overarching goals are: (1) to develop and adapt practice-based and other suicide prevention interventions for minority and disenfranchised groups, and (2) to design and test implementation strategies to optimize how evidence-based practices can be brought to scale efficiently and with high fidelity, for optimal effectiveness.

"Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY In the healthy brain, white matter connections coordinate the speed and reliability of communication among spatially distributed regions. The transmission of neural information with fine temporal precision is crucial for executive function (EF), defined as the coordination of attention, memory, and inhibitory control for goal-directed actions crucial for survival, health, and well-being. Notably, EF undergoes protracted development throughout youth, and the development of executive deficits is present in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and ADHD. However, the degree to which transdiagnostic executive deficits arise due to abnormal development of white matter networks remains unknown. Existing neuroimaging studies of transdiagnostic executive deficits have been limited by 1) inadequate methods to assess neurodevelopmental patterns of spatially distributed brain regions, and 2) inadequate theories of neural communication at the level of macro-scale structural networks. Here we address the latter challenge by generalizing long-established theoretical principles and empirical observations of efficient neurotransmission at the microscale neuron level to the macroscale structural connectome by calculating transmission fidelity. Transmission fidelity models how efficiently a brain region embedded in the structural network can transmit messages to a target region with individually differing speed and reliability. Moreover, we address the former challenge by capitalizing on advances in network science and machine learning. Utilizing these methods is a promising direction for investigating abnormal brain development. In this proposal, we describe the application of a novel analysis of structural network maturation to study the manifestation of transdiagnostic executive deficits. Using a large sample of youth who completed cross-sectional neuroimaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=1,042), our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structural connectivity and EF across age. We will use an additional cross-sectional dataset enriched with youths presenting with psychopathology acquired through the Healthy Brain Network study (n=5,000) to generalize our findings to executive dysfunction. To quantify developmental norms, we will capitalize on our large-scale datasets to train a machine learning model that predicts expected ranges of healthy brain development. Furthermore, understanding within-person changes in brain structure and EF necessitates longitudinal data. We will longitudinally assess youths diagnosed with ADHD (n=50) or schizophrenia (n=50), and typically developing comparators (n=40). In this proposal, we aim to 1) delineate how age-related variation of brain network transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders, and 2) determine how within-individual development in transmission fidelity is associated with executive dysfunction in ADHD and the psychosis spectrum. A better understanding of atypical inter-individual and within-individual developmental patterns of brain networks provides a framework towards precision medicine in neuropsychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individualized therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how developmental deviations from expected norms of brain maturation manifest as psychopathology. We propose to apply a novel method based on network science and machine learning to provide a new perspective on the brain’s developmental patterns that can manifest as executive deficits that span psychopathology. To delineate the typical and atypical development of executive function, we will develop a quantification of within-person longitudinal patterns of brain network maturation contextualized in predictions of developmental norms from unique large-scale neuroimaging datasets of youth.",Brain Network Maturation and Executive Dysfunction Spanning Diagnostic Categories of Psychopathology,10233459,F31MH126569,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Theory ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Synaptic Transmission ', ' Neural Transmission ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' mental development ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' theories ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' training opportunity ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' interindividual variability ', ' interindividual variation ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' connectome ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' Psychoses ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036,PA-03
"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10130714,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' ED Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ER nurse ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' economic evaluation ', ' economic analysis ', ' Blinded ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Cervical spine ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' implementation barriers ', ' implementation challenges ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,231701,MA-02
"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,10129768,R01MH115000,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Institutes ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Work ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Genetic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Sensory ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Neurocognition ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' neural correlate ', ' improved outcome ', ' phenotypic data ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' symptomatology ', ' Psychoses ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,377498,TN-05
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,10089147,R01MH113622,"['Accidents ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' irregular sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' experience ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' Participant ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Qualifying ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' in vivo ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' negative mood ', ' Prevalence ', ' Life Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Heritability ', ' Affective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' post-trauma stress ', ' posttrauma stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' traumatic event ', ' laboratory experience ', ' lab experience ', ' lab training ', ' laboratory training ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' recruit ', ' childhood adversity ', ' pediatric adversity ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,664089,OH-13
"Developing Suicide Risk Algorithms for Diverse Clinical Settings using Data Fusion Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Recent evidence indicates that many if not most of individuals who die by suicide have been in contact with the healthcare system in the months prior to their death, providing data that can be used to identify patients at risk prior to an attempt. The proposed project will develop an innovative method for identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior using data from a large multistate health information exchange, integrated with data from the State of Connecticut’s CHIME hospital database. We will develop and test suicide risk algorithms using principles associated with transfer learning, in which information from a comprehensive external data source is used to improve prediction in a more limited dataset. Specifically, we will use multimodal data fusion techniques to develop and test algorithms that can identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior by clinicians in hospitals with limited numbers of patients, select patient populations, and lack of access to outpatient data. This approach is not only generalizable to hospitals throughout the US but can be extended to very diverse clinical settings, e.g., primary and specialty care practices, community health centers, urgent care clinics. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients’ behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients at risk of suicide.

"Accessing the impact of youth suicide prevention program in small communities Project Summary/Abstract Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, particularly among youth aged 10–24 years. Youth in smaller, more rural communities, particularly American Indian/Native American youth, face heightened risk. Developing and delivering effective suicide prevention programs requires the means to rigorously evaluate their impact. Conducting impact evaluations of suicide prevention programs faces many challenges common to other fields, such as the difficulty in estimating the counterfactual when randomization is not feasible. These challenges are further compounded by the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates of suicide rates in communities and segments of the population with heightened risk due to the small size of such communities. Building on small area estimation techniques, Bayesian disease-mapping models were developed to improve estimation of disease or health outcome rates in small areas by borrowing information from neighboring areas. Despite their potential, these models have not been applied to program impact evaluation. This study has three aims: (1) examine a method to assess suicide prevention impact in small areas with heightened suicide risk; (2) identify particular conditions under which our proposed method can outperform alternative methods for impact evaluation; and (3) extend earlier assessments of the impact of the Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) Memorial youth suicide prevention program administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration by focusing on small, high-risk communities, such as tribal communities, that were underrepresented in previous study samples. This study will use both simulated and real data to empirically assess the accuracy of the proposed approach vis-à-vis three alternative methods to estimate impact: synthetic control, elastic net, and matrix completion. The simulated data will allow us to gauge how different levels of spatial and temporal dependence, as well as variations in other relevant parameters, affect the relative performance of approaches. Finally, we will use a sample of micropolitan and noncore communities exposed to the GLS program between 2006 and 2018 to estimate the impact of the GLS program on both suicide and self-harm hospitalization rates among youth. In sum, by applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to suicide prevention impact evaluation, we expect to both extend the utility of the approach beyond disease mapping and advance the ability to understand suicide prevention programming impact in some of the highest-risk populations. Project Narrative When evaluating suicide prevention programs, the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates of the outcome of interest in small communities and among segments of the population with heightened risk, including youth in rural communities or American Indian/Native American youth, compounds the usual challenges associated with assessing the impact of an intervention. We propose a novel approach for suicide prevention impact assessment in such settings, based on recent developments in Bayesian disease mapping, and will examine the performance of the approach using both simulated and real data from the Garrett Lee Smith youth suicide prevention program evaluation funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. If our findings reveal our approach to be accurate, this will provide an improved method to assess suicide prevention programming impact and will extend previous demonstrated impact findings to high-risk populations.",Accessing the impact of youth suicide prevention program in small communities,10213274,R03MH123905,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' County ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Prevention program ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Sum ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' community intervention ', ' tribal community ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' public health priorities ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' rural Americans ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' ']",NIMH,"ICF MACRO, INC.",R03,2021,73629,VA-11
"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Anxiety is characterized by a persistent and disruptive negative emotional state. This proposal will utilize pose estimation algorithms, unsupervised behavioral segmentation, neural population analyses, and simultaneous in vivo calcium imaging and input-specific optogenetic inhibition to investigate the mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety-like emotional states.
