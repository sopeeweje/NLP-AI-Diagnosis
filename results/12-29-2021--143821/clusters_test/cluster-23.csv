"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth? PROJECT SUMMARY While researchers continue to study the effects of disproportionate minority contact with law enforcement on a range of health-related outcomes, a recent review of this work questions the methodological validity of most studies on this topic. Many of these concerns focus on (a) unrealistic assumptions about police behavior and (b) poor quality data. This project addresses both by introducing a human development based model of law enforcement officer (LEO) behavior and applying this model to study how LEOs identify with male minority youth (MMY) using a novel publicly available data source: broadcast police communications (BPC). Our long-term goals are (1) to assess the viability of BPC for understanding how LEOs perceive MMY both “in the moment” via the pre-reflective procedural language used before and during LEO-MMY encounters and “at rest” via development of a survey instrument measuring LEO identification with minority youth, and (2) to determine if BPC may be used in lieu of non-public data sources to study police behavior by developing a novel computational strategy for extracting meaningful information from BPC via, among other strategies, a first-of-its-kind automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and large scale (>100 hours) training corpus of transcribed BPC for use by computational social scientists and ASR researchers. Our previous research revealed that a complex set of psychosocial mechanisms govern the developmental trajectories of MMYs, indicating MMYs adopt reactive coping strategies to particular stressful events (e.g. encounters with police) that can be maladaptive (e.g. hypermasculinity) depending on context of interactions. Our work also suggests that all humans are subject to similar processes. Since the outcomes of LEO-MMY encounters are ultimately the responsibility of LEOs, this project seeks to improve the quality of these encounters (i.e. reduce youth trauma) by studying a little acknowledged LEO reactive coping strategy: the character of procedural language used to provide LEOs with incident-specific information via BPC. This conceptual approach derives from our theoretical framing (i.e. Spencer’s phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory, or PVEST) that highlights the development and utilization of reactive coping strategies in response—particularly—to MMY associated stress. It is our premise that BPC can prime LEOs to inaccurately interpret the behavior of MMY as threatening, increasing the potential for adverse events. Such inaccurate assessments are hard to combat since LEOs are acting on the best information available. As a result, the procedural language of BPC pose unacknowledged risks to the well- being of MMY. This study will thus perform a first-of-its-kind analysis of BPC to simultaneously assess its viability for determining racial discrimination in policing and develop a novel survey instrument measuring LEOs ability to identify with MMY for use by researchers and policing organizations across the country. Public Health Relevance / Project Narrative Across the United States, adverse events involving law enforcement officers (LEOs) and male minority youth (MMY) and the toxic stress associated with repeated negative LEO-MMY encounters raise compelling public health concerns about racial discrimination in policing. The proposed research addresses these concerns by (a) introducing a novel human development paradigm for the study of police behavior that focuses on how and to what extent LEOs identify with MMY and (b) assessing the technological viability of using broadcast police communications (BPC) for large scale analysis of police behavior, where BPC are analyzed as pre-reflective accounts of LEO thought processes, representing both reactive and stable coping mechanisms (i.e., speech acts) for ensuring the safety of LEOs and the public at large. Accordingly, we propose (1) using this novel data source to understand how LEOs and MMYs come to perceive each other, (2) test a similarly novel survey instrument for measuring LEO identification with minority youth, in the process determining how much meaningful information can be reliably extracted from audio recordings of BPC for identifying racial discrimination in policing without the need to access highly sensitive police records or video recording data.",Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth?,10121621,R01MD015064,"['Archives ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Motivation ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Speech ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Law Enforcement Officers ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Research Activity ', ' data quality ', ' Exposure to ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' ESTs ', ' Expressed Sequence Tags ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' acronyms ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Trauma ', ' Affective ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' coping mechanism ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' course development ', ' class development ', ' course material development ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,744667,IL-01
"Neural mechanisms of risk for irritability across the transition to adolescence PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Irritability—exaggerated anger in response to non-reward—is among the most common psychiatric complaints. Because irritability in late childhood and adolescence predicts mental disorders across the lifespan, identifying the neural mechanisms involved in irritability across the transition to adolescence is paramount to intervene before youth irritability problems harden into entrenched psychiatric disorders in later adolescence and adulthood. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and inhibitory control in irritability is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry is important because reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change from childhood through adolescence. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize changes in irritability over the transition to adolescence. To this end, the proposal leverages data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a large, national longitudinal sample of preadolescents assessed annually (N=~8,312 with usable datasets; baseline age=9-10; 1-Year Follow-Up [1-YRFU] age=10-11; 2-YRFU age=11-12). At baseline and 2-YRFU, youth complete monetary incentive delay and stop-signal tasks during fMRI acquisition that assess neural responses to reward and inhibitory control, respectively. Across all waves, youth irritability and co-occurring psychopathology are assessed using clinical interviews and parent- and youth-report measures, and multiple behavioral and parent- and youth-reported measures of youth reward processing and inhibitory control are collected. Our central hypothesis is that preadolescents with both reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to show persistently high or increasing irritability across the transition to adolescence, whereas preadolescents with reward-related brain deficits, but better inhibition, will demonstrate decreases in irritability. Specific aims are to identify (1) separate and (2) interactive contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to concurrent irritability; to identify (3a) preadolescent reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors and (3b) developmental changes in reward and inhibition neural mechanisms, of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology across the transition to adolescence; and to explore (4) the moderating role of developmental-biological-contextual factors (sex, puberty, race/ethnicity, SES, familial characteristics) on these brain-behavior relationships. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (transition to adolescence) to prevent adult disorders, multiple time point imaging, formulation of a novel and comprehensive reward-based model of irritability, machine learning methodology, and replication analyses. Our project is significant because it will be a catalyst for a research program to inform precision medicine for irritability.

"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10067383,R01MH117141,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Stimulus ', ' learning extinction ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Scheme ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' early adolescence ', ' Structural defect ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' imaging platform ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,765655,WI-02
"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to

"Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback Project Summary  The proposed study will develop and evaluate a technology-assisted supervision protocol to promote treatment fidelity and more efficient delivery of evidence-based treatment (EBT) for ADHD in under-resourced community settings. The protocol (LC4S) will be grounded in the principles of measurement-based care. LC4S will task-shift basic supervision tasks to an existing machine learning tool that analyzes and codes therapy recordings for fidelity (Lyssn; lyssn.io; Tanana et al., 2019). These data will be automatically integrated into an established HIPAA-compliant online clinical dashboard that produces performance reports for therapists and supervisors (Care4; www.care4soft.net). Care4 also will be loaded with online facilitation resources for therapists, while supervisors will be trained to lead weekly in-person supervision sessions according to best practices in measurement-based care (Martino et al., 2016; Schoenwald et al., 2009; Webster-Stratton et al., 2014). This trial will be conducted in three community mental health agencies (Psych Solutions, Inc, Behavioral Aid Solutions, Jewish Community Services) in Miami-Dade County, FL that serve low income ethnic/racial minority youth and previously partnered with the research team in R01 MH106587. In Y01 of the project, we will conduct a stakeholder-focused development process for the LC4S intervention that begins with a thorough capacity and needs assessment using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009) and is guided by the Knowledge to Action (K2A) Implementation Science Framework (Graham et al., 2006). In this phase, we will hold monthly videoconference meetings between development teams at each agency, Care4, and the investigative team to iterate the final Care4 interface with an emphasis user-centered design. In year 1, we also will conduct a small open trial to obtain user feedback (12 cases, 3 supervisors, and 6 therapists) on LC4S and we will make final adaptations to the technology and protocol. In year 2, we will conduct a pilot Hybrid Type 3 Implementation- Effectiveness randomized controlled trial (Curran et al., 2012; N=72 youth; 24 youth, 8 therapists, and 2 supervisors per agency) that will randomly assign both therapists and youth to the LC4S condition or enhanced supervision as usual (ESAU). Both supervision conditions will be delivered by endogenous, agency supervisors who are trained in delivery of the EBT and the core elements of its supervision and have access to monthly phone consultation from experts. The proximal target in this R34 pilot RCT is session by session fidelity scores. The distal service delivery outcomes in this trial are: (1) quality of EBT implementation, (2) quantity of EBT delivered in standard intervention time frame, and (3) speed of delivery (i.e., number of sessions and days to EBT completion) for each case. In support of a future R01 that measures the impact of LC4S on patient outcomes across multiple EBTs, this R34 will also focus on developing and validating appropriate study measures, testing for contamination across conditions, and establishing the costs of the LC4S intervention versus ESAU. Project Narrative Evidence-based behavior therapy for ADHD demonstrates a decrement in fidelity and effectiveness when moving from university to community settings, largely due to limited resources in poor communities (Sibley, Graziano, Coxe, Bickman, & Martin, 2020). As a result, access to quality mental health care suffers among minority, socio-economically disadvantaged adolescents who commonly seek care in these settings and are at risk for the worst clinical outcomes (Sibley, Coxe, Stein, & Meinzer, 2020). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and web-based technology can be used to automate and task-shift key supervision and training tasks (i.e., fidelity monitoring and feedback, booster trainings) thus improving fidelity and effectiveness while reducing costs associated with burdensome measurement-based supervision protocols (Tanana et al., 2019).",Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with

"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,10300427,F31MH123038,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Funding ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' parent role ', ' parental role ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Update ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' childhood anxiety ', ' pediatric anxiety ', ' youth anxiety ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' person centered ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' anxiety treatment ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' family burden ', ' burden on families ', ' burden to families ', ' familial burden ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2021,33247,PA-02
"Smart Technology for Anorexia Nervosa Recovery: A Pilot Intervention for the Post-Acute Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anorexia nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, with a typical onset in adolescence. Although family-based interventions are efficacious for up to 75% of adolescents with AN, approximately 30% will relapse after recovery. There is a critical need to optimize treatments and prevent post-discharge relapse following acute treatment to improve outcomes for adolescents with AN. To address this critical need, our team developed a suite of digital tools that advance the science of assessment, risk prediction, and clinical-decision support for use in the post-acute treatment window, called “Smart Treatment for Anorexia Recovery (STAR).” STAR uses cutting-edge assessment technology to shorten test administration and machine-learning to predict likelihood of recovery. This information is then provided back to the clinician via an easy-to-use clinical- decision support tool to alert the clinician when user-entered data suggests the patient is not progressing. In the current application, we propose to expand STAR to test an adaptive mHealth intervention delivered in the post-discharge window. Our scientific premise is that a transdiagnostic assessment and clinical-decision support tool delivered within the STAR suite will optimize face-to-face clinical service and the addition of an adaptive mHealth intervention will improve outpatient treatment response and reduce relapse in adolescents discharged from intensive treatment for AN. Our previous work supports our scientific premise. Specifically, our studies provide robust support for the predictive validity and clinical utility of our assessment tool for predicting ED-related psychiatric impairment and recovery. However, the number of items across our paper-based assessment tool is 144, which is overly long for routine use. To overcome this challenge, we developed a mobile phone app that uses computerized adaptive testing to reduce assessment length by up to 50% while retaining the reliability and validity of the original paper-and-pencil measure. We propose to leverage this innovation to optimize both face-to-face and mHealth treatment for AN. Our objectives are to: 1) develop the mHealth intervention (with clinician and stakeholder input) and 2) establish feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect size of our mHealth intervention using both clinician and patient data. To accomplish our objectives, we will employ a computerized adaptive test coupled with machine learning algorithms, delivered within our app to signal clinicians when their clients are at-risk for poor outcomes and relapse. Specific aims include: 1) adapt our existing clinical tool to provide therapist support modules and patient mHealth messages; 2) conduct a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) of our integrated assessment and mHealth intervention tool ; 3) test preliminary mechanisms that lead to changes in AN symptoms. Given there is a scarcity of specialty care for AN following acute treatment, yet 95% of adolescents have smart phones, the proposed research is innovative and significant because it has the future potential to reduce relapse and optimize existing community-delivered interventions for AN over the post-acute treatment window. PROJECT NARRATIVE AN is the third leading cause of chronic illness in adolescents and, if left untreated, can lead to major organ damage, structural and functional brain changes, and early-onset osteopenia and osteoporosis. The proposed research is, therefore, relevant to public health because a transdiagnostic assessment and clinical-decision support tool will optimize face-to-face clinical service and the addition of an adaptive mHealth intervention has the potential to improve post-acute community-based outpatient treatment response in adolescents with anorexia nervosa. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s mission to tailor existing interventions to optimize outcomes and to test interventions for effectiveness in community practice settings (see NIMH’s Goal 3: Strive for Prevention and Cures).",Smart Technology for Anorexia Nervosa Recovery: A Pilot Intervention for the Post-Acute Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa,10284797,R34MH127022,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Anorexia ', ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Anxiety ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Emotions ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Osteopenia ', ' Osteopenias ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Work ', ' Inosine Dialdehyde ', ' Diglycolaldehyde ', ' IdA ', ' Inox ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' satisfaction ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Notification ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Output ', ' early onset ', ' post intervention ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' usability ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' routine practice ', ' clinical practice ', ' eating pathology ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' adolescent patient ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' practice setting ', ' clinical decision support ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' efficacious intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R34,2021,242277,KS-02
"Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Military sexual trauma (MST) is a serious and pervasive problem among military populations, affecting approximately 16% of military personnel and veterans [1]. Substance use disproportionately affects individuals with a history of MST. Individuals with (vs. without) a history of MST are twice as likely to misuse substances [2-4]. Substance use among military samples has been linked to higher rates of negative consequences across several domains (e.g., health, occupational, legal [5, 6]), including death (e.g., overdose [7], traffic accidents [8], suicide [7, 8]). Further, while understudied among individuals with a history of MST in particular, negative substance use outcomes have been shown to be more severe among trauma-exposed populations, including more severe clinical presentations and poorer treatment prognosis [9, 10]. These findings emphasize the importance of clarifying the association between MST and substance use among military populations. Despite the clinical relevance and public health significance of substance use among military populations, research in this area has relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional designs. Moreover, the vast majority of studies in this area have utilized traditional statistical methods, which are limited in scope and capabilities. These limitations have important clinical implications, as they restrict our ability to specify the exact nature and directionality of the relationship between MST and substance use, thereby affecting how findings are translated into prevention and intervention efforts. The proposed research aims to fill these critical gaps by utilizing the Army STARRS pre/post-deployment study, a large, prospective military dataset to: (1) explicate the directional relation between MST and substance use using a longitudinal dataset, and (2) employ machine learning methods to develop an algorithm to optimize detection of substance use in military personnel with a history of MST. These findings will assist in elucidating the etiology of substance use among this high-risk group, as well as provide a prediction model for clinical use to better target at-risk individuals in this population. This research project will take place within the Department of Psychology at the University of Rhode Island; an institution with a strong history and commitment to health behavior research and methodology. The applicant will have access to sponsors and consultants with expertise in MST, substance use, advanced methodology, and statistical analysis that will facilitate her career objectives to develop increased knowledge and proficiency in (a) sexual trauma (e.g., MST) and substance use in military veterans; (b) grant/manuscript development; (c) statistical and methodological capabilities (i.e., machine learning); and (d) big data. The proposed project uses a timely and innovative approach to advance science on the relation between MST and substance use in military personnel. Addressing substance use in this population is necessary to improve the health of our nation's veterans, and aligns with the mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

"The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence PROJECT SUMMARY Few effective interventions exist for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which are associated with significant impairment, high rates of disability, and substantial public health costs. The prevalence of NDDs has increased considerably over the past two decades, and children with NDDs make up the largest proportion of youth that seek mental health treatment. Thus, novel approaches for understanding NDDs and identifying potential treatment targets for these disorders are needed. NDDs often have comorbid presentations and shared symptomatology (e.g., impaired social functioning), which suggests that using a transdiagnostic approach to study NDDs may be informative. This approach could reveal modifiable factors and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that could be targeted through intervention to reduce neurodevelopmental symptomatology. Social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) may be a salient protective factor for youth with neurodevelopmental symptomatology. An important neural correlate for social functioning appears to be functional connectivity within the salience network (SN), which is involved in detection of relevant stimuli (e.g., changes in other's emotional expressions).Thus, social connectedness and related connectivity within the SN may be predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. The potential protective role of these factors may be particularly salient during adolescence, which is a vulnerable period for many of the negative outcomes associated with NDDs. The proposed longitudinal project will capitalize on the multi-level framework of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study by using psychosocial, functional neuroimaging, and cognitive data from two timepoints (i.e., baseline and one-year follow-up) to assess neurodevelopmental functioning in a sample of >11,500 youth in early adolescence. The project will be conducted at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research, which is an ABCD study site. The aims of the proposed project are threefold: to determine whether 1) social connectedness is associated with SN functional connectivity cross-sectionally; 2) social connectedness predicts future neurodevelopmental function; and 3) SN functional connectivity predicts future neurodevelopmental function. These aims will be assessed using linear mixed effects models with relevant covariates included (e.g., baseline neurodevelopmental function, youth ethnicity, youth gender, and family income). The proposed study has an exploratory aim of utilizing a data-driven, machine learning approach to identify additional modifiable factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, screen time) that predict future neurodevelopmental function. The project is novel in that it takes a transdiagnostic approach to studying NDDs, it is longitudinal, and it has the potential for replication and extension as future data are released. Results from the project could have meaningful clinical relevance with the potential for identifying treatment targets for future interventions aiming to improve neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are associated with significant impairment and public health costs and few psychological interventions are known to be effective for reducing neurodevelopmental symptomatology, identification of novel treatment targets for individuals with NDDs is needed. The present longitudinal study will address this need by utilizing a large, nationally-representative sample of youth (N = 11,500+; age 9-10) to examine the roles of social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) and related neural connectedness (i.e., functional connectivity within the salience network) in predicting future neurodevelopmental functioning (indexed by both parent-reported symptoms and objective executive function tasks). Results from this study could therefore delineate modifiable social factors and underlying neural mechanisms that are protective against neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence and inform future clinical research.",The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence,10237174,F31HD103340,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', '

"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10227064,R01DA048764,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Cocaine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' interest ', ' ethanol craving ', ' alcohol craving ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' Cocaine Addiction ', ' Cocaine Dependence ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drinking ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Stratification ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Alcoholism ', ' treatment effect ', ' open source ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' trial design ', ' treatment group ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,384135,NY-25
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life.

"Mechanisms and Predictors of Change in App-Based Mindfulness Training for Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years. Headspace – among the most popular of these platforms – has over 42 million users. Recent surveys indicate that 11% of U.S. adolescents have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with anxiety or depressive symptoms, which increase substantially during the adolescent years. A growing body of research implicates rumination as being a transdiagnostic risk factor involved in the development of depression and anxiety in youth. Critically, mindfulness meditation has shown significant promise in targeting rumination, and ultimately improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means for accessing mindfulness training, while being interactive and engaging for youth. Despite their growing popularity among teens, strikingly little research has been conducted on these apps. Two critical questions have yet to be addressed, which are strongly aligned with the NCCIH Strategic Plan: (1) what are the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps and (2) for whom is app-based mindfulness well-suited. To address these gaps, adolescents (ages 13-18) will be randomly assigned to an app-delivered mindfulness course vs. an active control condition and will complete pre- and post-intervention resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to probe static and dynamic functional connectivity within – and between – brain networks strongly implicated in mindfulness training and rumination (i.e., Default Mode Network and Salience Network). In addition, cognitive tasks will be administered at pre- and post-intervention to assess attentional control abilities putatively enhanced by mindfulness training. Finally, mindfulness skills and changes in rumination will be assessed via a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol developed in the PI’s lab. First, we will test whether changes in (1) brain functional connectivity, (2) attentional control and (3) acquisition and use of mindfulness skills mediate between-group (i.e., app vs. control) differences in the reduction of rumination. Second, we will test whether a machine learning model incorporating baseline clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics can be used to identify which adolescents are predicted to benefit from app-based mindfulness training. Recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting outcome at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Ultimately, such an algorithm may inform individual risk-benefit assessments that could be used to objectively communicate the probability of experiencing positive vs. adverse outcomes to users prior to engaging with a mindfulness app. Collectively, results are expected to advance (1) our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of app-based mindfulness training and (2) our ability to predict which adolescents are well-suited to these increasingly popular apps. Project Narrative Mindfulness-based smartphone apps have surged in popularity in recent years (e.g., the Headspace app has over 42 million users). An estimated 11% of U.S. adolescents have used mindfulness apps as a means of coping with symptoms of depression and anxiety, which increase substantially during the adolescent years, and which have been repeatedly linked to rumination in youth. The research activities of the proposed R01 will investigate the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps on rumination, and a machine learning algorithm will be developed to predict which specific adolescents are expected to benefit from app-based mindfulness training.",Mechanisms and Predictors of Change in App-Based Mindfulness Training for Adolescents,10207235,R01AT011002,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Panic ', ' Probability ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Risk-Benefit Assessment ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Affective ', ' mindfulness ', ' mindfulness meditation ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' cognitive task ', ' attentional control ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' Grain ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' kernel methods ', ' kernel learning ', ' multi-kernel learning ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCCIH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,660856,MA-05
"Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K23 proposal seeks to provide an early-career clinical psychologist and neuroscientist (Dr. Alexander Weigard) with the mentorship, training, and resources necessary to launch a career as an independent patient- oriented investigator focused on using advanced computational methods to elucidate etiological mechanisms of substance use disorders (SUDs) and generate meaningful predictions for patients. The candidate will work towards this long-term goal through the completion of a research project focused on assessing whether two advanced computational methods can facilitate the selection of features from neuroscientific data that are relevant for the individualized prediction of SUD risk in youth. Although extant research in developmental neuroscience has identified multiple early risk factors that are associated with development of SUD at the group level, there is currently a dearth of large scale, replicable research in which neurocognitive data are used to make reliable and generalizable predictions of SUD outcomes for individual youth. In the proposed project, the candidate will combine his existing expertise in computational models of cognition with new training in predictive informatics methods to assess whether two advanced computational approaches, a) sequential sampling models (SSMs) of cognition and b) network neuroscience, can be used to extract features from longitudinal neurocognitive data that enhance the prediction of youths’ SUD outcomes. The candidate will conduct extensive analyses with two large data sets (Michigan Longitudinal Study, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study) and collect pilot data with 60 young adults to accomplish the following research aims: 1) Quantify the added benefit of SSM parameters for improving the performance of multivariate SUD prediction models, and 2) Identify the multivariate neural signature of v, an SSM parameter with promising links to substance use, and determine the potential of this signature for predicting a precursor to SUD (substance use initiation in mid-adolescence) in ABCD and differentiating young adults with SUDs in the newly-collected pilot sample. Completion of the following training objectives will ensure that the candidate can both carry out the proposed project and establish himself as an independent investigator who is well-equipped to conduct future projects following from this work: 1) Mastering principles of machine learning model development and testing in longitudinal data sets, 2) building expertise in using multivariate network neuroscience methods for feature selection and prediction, 3) increasing clinical and epidemiological knowledge of SUD risk factors beyond neurocognition, and 4) improving professional skills necessary to become an independent patient-oriented investigator. The proposed K23 aims to take a crucial step towards the development of advanced computational neuroscience methods that may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts by identifying reliable predictors of individuals’ SUD risk, and to set the candidate up to independently conduct leading edge research in the interest of this larger goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Decades of developmental neuroscience research have illuminated multiple factors that convey risk for the development of substance use disorders (SUDs) at the group level, but the field currently lacks methods for using neurocognitive data to make accurate and generalizable predictions about SUD risk for individual youth. The proposed project seeks to address this critical gap in the field by providing an early-career scientist with the tools and training necessary to test whether the combination of two advanced computational approaches, sequential sampling models of cognitive functioning and network neuroscience methods, improve the accuracy of multivariate predictive models of individuals’ SUD risk. Knowledge from this project could lead to the development of novel computational approaches that optimize the identification of predictive features in youths’ neurocognitive data, which may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts.",Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders,10213907,K23DA051561,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' model development ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' substance use among youth ', ' youth substance use ', ' early onset substance use ', ' early initiation substance use ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Advanced Development ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Neurocognition ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' neural patterning ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' cognitive development ', ' learning network ', ' connectome ', ' predictive signature ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' feature selection ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,196560,MI-12
"Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube PROJECT SUMMARY I was awarded my first R01 (parent grant) on June 1, 2020. However, the university-wide hiring freeze due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the birth of my child and maternity leave set back the project progress. Thus, this Administrative Supplement, which is focused on supporting first-time grantees who experienced critical life events, will be used to catch up on the delayed progress from Year 1 of the parent grant. Please note that the Specific Aims of this Supplement remain the same as those of the parent grant. The overall goal of the parent grant is to understand ways in which youth modify e-cigarettes, their motivations for doing so, and marketing sources, using YouTube analysis, survey methodology, and expert evaluation. We will identify modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing using fictitious youth YouTube viewer profiles to search for e-cigarettes using a browser plug-in and custom scripted web-crawling and then machine learning to automatically code the videos to identify e-cigarette modifications and marketing source. Our Advisory Committee (AC) of subject matter experts in tobacco regulatory science, social media, youth tobacco use, toxicology, communications, and tobacco marketing will apply their knowledge to assess the potential impact of these identified modified uses on appeal, addiction, and health effects of e-cigarettes to identify those which are amenable to FDA regulations and communications. We will then conduct an in-depth analysis of these selected behaviors using a combination of machine learning and detailed human coding on youth-accessible YouTube videos to understand: 1) components that are modified (e.g., batteries, cartridges/pods, e-liquids), 2) motivations for modification (e.g., enhance user experience, reduce perceived harm), 3) marketing sources (e.g., online shops, pro-e-cigarette organizations), and 4) appeal (number of likes, views). We will also use an online survey with adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users (N=1000) to examine the prevalence, appeal, motivations, risk perceptions, and marketing exposure related to these modified uses and their predictors (i.e., demographic variables, past-month e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette dependence, other tobacco/substance use, interpersonal and intrapersonal risk factors). The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to 1) develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified by youth, 2) restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on social media such as YouTube, and 3) develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of modifying e-cigarettes. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: E-cigarette use among youth is high; thus, to inform youth e-cigarette prevention, we will examine the youth appeal of the product, such as the ability to modify or “hack” the devices and their related components for unintended uses and marketing on popular social media, YouTube. We will use mixed-methods (i.e., machine learning, survey methodology, expert evaluation) to achieve our aim. The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified, restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on YouTube, and develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of engaging in these behaviors.",Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube,10382066,R01DA049878,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Freezing ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Toxicology ', ' Universities ', ' Maternity leave ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Custom ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' tobacco product use ', ' Tobacco use ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' risk perception ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco product advertising ', ' Prevalence ', ' Plug-in ', ' demographics ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' parent grant ', ' public health relevance ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' vaping ', ' social media ', ' Research Assistant ', ' tobacco regulatory science ', ' electronic cigarette user ', ' e-cig user ', ' e-cigarette user ', ' ecig user ', ' ecigarette user ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' marijuana vaping ', ' cannabis vaping ', ' electronic liquid ', ' e-cig liquids ', ' e-cigarette liquids ', ' e-juice ', ' e-liquid ', ' ecig liquids ', ' ecigarette liquids ', ' ejuice ', ' eliquid ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,73027,CT-03
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,10051424,R01MH116969,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Literature ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' Single major depression ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' major depressive episode ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Neuroses ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' neurotic ', ' neuroticism ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' pleasure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' cognitive system ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' endophenotype ', ' cognitive control ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' neural correlate ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' kernel methods ', ' kernel learning ', ' multi-kernel learning ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,532914,MA-05
"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms. Identifying such markers for bipolar disorder has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of illness and informing treatment planning and personalized interventions.",From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models,10116487,R01MH121451,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Behavior ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linear Models ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Matched Group ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity -

"Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology ABSTRACT Difficulties with emotion expression and social behavior characterize multiple psychiatric conditions and negatively impact child development. However, existing measurement tools for indexing social-emotional function are imprecise and subjective, or require specialized training that is costly and time-intensive, prohibiting widespread implementation. The imprecision of existing tools has a major negative impact not only on research, but on the ability to assess and treat individuals with mental health concerns – especially among underserved and under-resourced populations. Here, we propose to address this problem by quantifying social and emotional behavior using novel biobehavioral markers derived from computer vision (facial expression analysis) and computational linguistics (social/sentiment analysis). Our team has successfully used these markers to predict the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 91% accuracy. In this proposal, we determine the extent to which our markers can serve as continuous measures of social behavior and negative emotion to advance clinical phenotyping and interventions. The proposal brings together two high-bandwidth clinical research programs at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Baylor College of Medicine to collect data on 750 adolescents (ages 12-17 inclusive) with ASD, a primary anxiety or depressive disorder, or without any developmental/psychiatric condition. At a single assessment, all youth will participate in an extensive clinical phenotyping battery consisting of validated clinical interviews and child-/parent-report scales assessing converging and diverging mental health constructs, and three tasks eliciting positive/negative emotion, social stress, and mild frustration. A subsample of 150 adolescents will be reassessed 6-10 weeks later to allow retest/stability analyses. A novel camera apparatus will capture naturalistic synchronized verbal and nonverbal signals from dyads. Our analytic approach combines state-of-the-art machine learning, computational linguistics, and computer vision – including facial emotion recognition methods that rival several commonly used alternatives. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop valid and objective measures of the Social and Negative Valence Systems using novel biobehavioral markers in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth. Secondary goals are to develop easy-to-follow methods to widely disseminate our tools and procedures, and to characterize individual variability in these key RDoC metrics by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis. The achievement of these goals will provide researchers with sorely needed measures of social and emotional behavior, and provide clinicians with a new set of tools for identifying and tracking youth in need of mental health treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with negative emotion and social behavior are present across many behavioral health conditions, but are poorly measured with existing tools. This application addresses this problem by developing and validating novel facial expression and linguistic measures that can be easily and widely disseminated across research and clinical settings.",Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology,10183399,R01MH125958,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Frustration ', ' Goals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Judgment ', ' Laboratories ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Play ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Smiling ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' autistic children ', ' children with ASD ', ' children with autism ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' socially stressed ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Trier Social Stress Test ', ' Individual Differences ', ' natural language ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Computational Linguistics ', ' Social Processes ', ' Negative Valence ', ' social anxiety ', ' emotional behavior ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Grain ', ' affective computing ', ' social deficits ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social metrics ', ' sociometrics ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,861615,PA-03

"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth - Supplement Project Summary/Abstract - no change from original The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH’s mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. Project Narrative - no change from original The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth - Supplement,10397801,R01MH059929,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Clinical ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Sampling ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' information processing ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' mood symptom ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,64312,PA-18
"Identifying drug and alcohol displays on social media using a machine learning approach, and mechanisms that impact adolescent substance use PROJECT SUMMARY  The overall goal of this application is to support and facilitate the necessary training to develop an independent research career focused on examining online and offline social contexts that influence adolescent substance use (SU). In the long-term, the applicant seeks to develop a program of research focused on the use of digital technologies to examine social risk factors that lead to alcohol and drug use among adolescents and to deliver prevention programming. Through the training goals, guided mentorship, and complementary experiences, the proposed project will strategically advance the applicant's knowledge of social media and SU research. The applicant will also be trained in state-of-the-art quantitative methodologies to enhance the design, conduct, and analysis of big data to improve our current understanding of socialization effects on adolescent SU.  The prevention of alcohol and drug use among adolescents remains a critical area for research, as experimentation with alcohol and drug use can lead to long-term negative consequences. In fact, 9 out of 10 people that experience SU problems began using before the age of 18 (CASAColumbia, 2011). While initiation of SU typically occurs during the teenage years, adolescents are also spending a substantial amount of time using social media. Adolescents use social media as a way to connect with a social network, as well as view and display SU behaviors. However, research evaluating the impact of social media on adolescent SU has been understudied, and the available research has several methodological limitations. Namely, prior work has primarily focused on college samples, as well as a less popular social media platform among adolescents (i.e., Facebook). Furthermore, prior work has used self-report data or human coding to assess online SU content. The proposed study seeks to advance the knowledge regarding the role of social media, specifically exposure to SU content, and user-generated e-cigarette content, in the escalation of alcohol and drug use among adolescents.  The proposed project at the center of this training fellowship includes two aims that propose secondary data analyses, and the collection of original data. Aim 1 of the proposed project (n = 243) will use secondary data analyses to determine whether SU attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control mediate the prospective association between exposure to SU-related content posted by peers and influential figures on offline SU behaviors. Aim 2 of the proposed project (n = 200) will prospectively examine the association between online user-generated e-cigarette content on Instagram and offline e-cigarette use using a novel methodological approach. Machine learning algorithms will be developed to detect e-cigarette content on Instagram profiles, and will be compared to self-report data to assess whether the strength of this association varies based on approach. This project will increase knowledge of adolescent SU behaviors that are not visible offline that could uniquely inform prevention programs by identifying modifiable targets for intervention that are relevant for today's youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescent substance use can result in a number of challenges and severe long-term consequences, including academic difficulties, legal problems, the later emergence of a substance use disorder, and injury or death. Social media provides adolescents with opportunities to display and view a variety of substance use behaviors in the absence of negative consequences, and may now represent a key socialization mechanism that has not been widely investigated. The project at the center of this training grant will be the first to assess the influence of exposure to substance use content, by both peers and influential figures, on adolescent substance use, and to identify e-cigarette displays on social media using a machine learning approach.","Identifying drug and alcohol displays on social media using a machine learning approach, and mechanisms that impact adolescent substance use",10314603,F31DA053003,"['Adolescent Behavior ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Socialization ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Fostering ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' high school ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Legal ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Collection ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' substance use among youth ', ' youth substance use ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' prospective ', ' drinking behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' peer influence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' deter alcohol use ', ' alcohol use prevention ', ' prevent alcohol use ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' vaping ', ' social media ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' Facebook ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NIDA,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,36877,FL-26
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality.

"2/2-Neurodevelopmental and Clinical Trajectories of Youth at Risk for Bipolar Disorder ABSTRACT Although bipolar I disorder is a dynamic condition expressing a wide range of affective, cognitive and neurovegetative symptoms, it is defined by the occurrence of mania. Mania typically first emerges in adolescence and young adulthood, and it is a strongly predictive phenotype. Moreover, the early course of bipolar I disorder is progressive, as euthymic periods shorten over time. Additionally, bipolar I disorder is strongly familial with heritability rates approaching 85%. A family history of bipolar I disorder increases risk for mania as well as a number of other psychiatric conditions, including suicidal behaviors and reward hypersensitivity. Together, these characteristics suggest that bipolar I disorder results from an inherited failure during adolescence to develop healthy neural systems that modulate mood and behavioral activation. Complicating the inherited risk is that people with a family history of bipolar disorder also report higher rates of early life adversity than the general population. Early life adversity is associated with lifelong elevated rates of depression, anxiety and substance use disorders, impaired risk-reward processing, and suicide. Consequently, during development individuals with a familial risk for bipolar I disorder may be exposed to a dual risk, i.e. an inherited vulnerability and environmental early-life stress. How these risks interact to impact brain development and subsequent outcomes in these individuals is not known.  Mood and risk-reward behaviors are managed by intersecting ventral prefrontal networks. These networks undergo substantial development in the transition from adolescence to young adulthood (when bipolar I disorder emerges) in which maturation of prefrontal networks leads to adaptive adult emotional regulation and risk-reward processing. Abnormalities in these networks are commonly described in both bipolar disorder and in response to early life adversity, with many shared characteristics. With these considerations in mind, we hypothesize that heritability for bipolar I disorder interacts with early life adversity to synergistically disrupt healthy ventral prefrontal network development during adolescence, underlying a cumulative increased risk for developing mania and other conditions more common in bipolar families. To test this hypothesis, over a four-year interval we will assess trajectories in ventral prefrontal network connectivity in youth at-familial-risk for bipolar I disorder compared to those without this risk, and the interaction with or without early life trauma, to determine whether these risks cumulatively lead to increasing emergence of: 1) mood symptoms and syndromes, 2) substance misuse, 3) suicidal behaviors, and 4) approach motivation hypersensitivity. These results can inform future approaches to prevent illness onset and progression in individuals at risk for or early in the course of bipolar disorder.

"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent

"Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescents experience escalating risk for developing clinical depression, which can lead to lifelong morbidity and mortality. The neural, physical, cognitive, and socioemotional changes that may contribute to this risk also signal an opportunity for high impact intervention. Unfortunately, psychotherapy trials demonstrate modest effects on youth depression. To improve long-term outcomes for adolescents, this study will identify person- specific drivers of adolescent depression that can guide treatment personalization. Prior research with depressed or anxious adults demonstrates the existence of such drivers—symptoms and related processes that are influential (i.e., predict change in other symptoms), modifiable, and exhibit individual differences. Personalized selection and sequencing of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules to target these drivers early in adults have produced larger treatment effects compared to a historical benchmark. Identifying person- specific drivers during adolescence could inform treatments that account for both developmental and individual differences to shift the trajectory of depression onset and maintenance. Investigating person-specific drivers usually involves intensive surveying of self-reported experience via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Emerging evidence suggests that smartphones can also monitor mood through passive sensing of depression-related behaviors with minimal response burden. However, nearly all such studies have been conducted with adults, despite near universal smartphone ownership among adolescents in the US. Thus, this study will leverage depressed adolescents' everyday smartphone use to assess the validity of mobile sensing against established ambulatory methods (i.e., EMA and actigraphy) to identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression. Fifty adolescents (12–18 years old) with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in 30 days of: a) smartphone-based EMA of depressive symptoms, processes, and affect (4x/day), sleep diary (1x/day); (b) mobile sensing of mobility, physical activity, sleep, natural language use in typed interpersonal communication, screen-on time and call frequency/duration; and (c) wrist actigraphy of physical activity and sleep. Adolescents and caregivers will complete diagnostic interviews and other measures (e.g., developmental, clinical, Research Domain Criteria) at baseline, as well as user feedback interviews at follow- up. To address study aims: 1) idiographic, within-subject networks of EMA symptoms will be modeled to identify each adolescent's drivers; 2) correlations among EMA, mobile sensor, and actigraph measures of sleep, physical, and social activity; and machine learning prediction of core depressive symptoms (self- reported mood and anhedonia) will be used to assess the validity of mobile sensing for identifying person- specific drivers; 3) between-subject baseline characteristics will be explored as predictors of person-specific drivers. These results will inform future development of a scalable, low-burden smartphone-based tool that can guide personalized treatment decisions for depressed adolescents, with potential public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescence is marked by escalating risk for developing clinical depression, but also presents an optimal window for high impact intervention to alter the course of this often disabling disorder. To inform future efforts to personalize psychological interventions for depressed adolescents and maximize their efficacy, the proposed study will identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression—influential and modifiable symptoms and processes that exhibit individual differences—and demonstrate the validity of using a smartphone tool to identify these person-specific drivers. The proposed study will generate data to inform the development of a scalable, low-burden, smartphone-based tool to guide treatment decisions, with potential public health impact given near-universal smartphone ownership among adolescents across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the US.",Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data,10196290,R21MH126394,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Irritable Mood ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Ownership ', ' Parents ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Personal Communication ', ' Interpersonal Communication ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' diaries ', ' Frequencies ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' treatment effect ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' network models ', ' natural language ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' anxious ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' ']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,198257,FL-26
"Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is an impairing and prevalent mood disorder in adolescence, affecting 1 in 6 youth by age 18. So far, the use of conventional statistical approaches has had limited success in delivering tools for accurate individualized prediction of future depression for a specific child. The objective of this project is to build advanced non-linear machine learning algorithms integrating information from multiple sources to deliver accurate, individualized prediction. To accomplish this objective, the research team will use 5,000 variables (biological, cognitive, socio-emotional, environmental) measured on multiple occasions between the prenatal period and age 10 in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 15,636). The goal is to use features from the prenatal period to age 10 to estimate risk of reaching clinical levels of depressive symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. The research team will pursue two specific aims. The first aim is to build an algorithm for accurate prediction of adolescent depression by using informative features from the prenatal period until age 10 with machine learning methods that capture complex, multi-variate associations. The team will use several techniques, including artificial neural networks that exploit temporal information (recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to identify constellations of highly predictive features. Based on early-life stress sensitization theory, the first hypothesis is that features from the prenatal and early postnatal periods (up to age 5) provide greater predictive power than features from ages 6-10. The second aim is to determine if features predicting depression are unique to depression or shared with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. Machine learning algorithms will predict age 18 clinical diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. The team will test the second hypothesis that some predictive features will be unique for each disorder and some will be shared across all three disorder types (e.g., childhood trauma). By accomplishing these aims, the research team will devise a clinically useful algorithm to estimate a child’s probability of developing adolescent depression. All software that will be created for this project will be open-source, and made freely available online in public repositories. Algorithms that would allow accurate early identification of children at risk to develop depression during future adolescent years would provide new avenues for preemptive interventions. This would yield enormous public health benefits by prioritizing treatment and shifting developmental trajectories away from eventual disorder for millions of individuals worldwide. To realize the potential of this overall impact on the field and society, predictive models that calculate risk with high sensitivity and specificity in childhood are needed. The proposed project aims to use robust, rigorous machine learning algorithms to take on this challenge. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on depression in adolescence, which is highly prevalent and impairing during this life stage and a major risk factor for suicide. The project is relevant to NIMH’s mission because it aims to identify early behavioral and biological indicators of risk for depression in order to predict the onset of illness and support early

"Prototype for an online skills-based drug prevention program targeting youth 11-13 PROJECT ABSTRACT Drug prevention programs that migrate to the web are interactive, but mostly fail to engage youth and maximize program exposure. An alternative approach considers gamification with animated sequences and uses machine learning algorithms based on Markov Decision Processes to stimulate youths’ curiosity, engage them in a real-world scenario that requires real-time strategic thinking. In this Phase I SBIR, we propose to design, build, and test an alpha prototype for Skills-Based Learning (SBL) Online, a fully gamified drug abuse prevention program. Gamification studies now conclusively show that youth can and do learn from playing videogames, particularly when they feel immersed in the game, maintain high levels of curiosity, and form a social identity or close attachment to the characters in the game. Programs also stimulate learning when they provide scaffolding, using guiding, coaching, and modeling that help youth master skills and advance to new challenge levels. In addition, the game has to be responsive to the player, incorporate their in- game behavior, and tailor play to their skill levels as opposed to delivering a prefixed program. When these elements of a videogame come together, they have been shown to stimulate higher order thinking and problem-solving skills that have value in the real-world. We propose to blend instructional design principles with state-of-the-art gamification using machine learning algorithms to create a realistic animated game that teaches decision-making, problem-solving, and social skills. The game involves animation, brief video vignettes, non-playing characters, and a personalized pedagogical agent (an avatar) to guide youth through a simulated environment that presents them with realistic social interactional challenges. The program targets youth in early adolescence (ages 11 to 13), a period when they face numerous developmental challenges that when successfully negotiated helps them crystallize an identity. Shifting tides of influence from parents to peers, seeking emotional independence and greater autonomy plus the adoption of formal operational reasoning are a few of the many factors that fuel “storm and stress” during adolescence. This Phase I application will coalesce the strengths of prevention and computer scientists to build and test an alpha prototype of SBL Online. The study combines formative evaluation using focus groups to learn more about the nature of youths’ social interactions, the settings in which they encounter peer pressure, their perceptions of risky behavior, future orientation, and problem-solving skills they employ to offset life’s pressures. Usability testing iteratively covers early and later build phases, plus active playtesting using think-aloud techniques. A second thrust involves obtaining input from key stakeholders (middle school teachers, youth service providers) to ascertain the program’s developmental and cultural appropriateness and commercial potential. The technology partner (3C) has an extensive acumen building and commercializing social emotional learning- based health-related applications for children and youth including projects with the investigators. NARRATIVE  Adolescent drug use, including the consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana, remain significant health and social problems that require the development of effective preventive strategies. This research advances game-based learning with an online drug prevention program that can be delivered alone or in conjunction with other classroom-based instructional strategies. Moreover, this intervention combines emerging instructional design and learning theories in combination with evidence-based prevention science to create a fun, engaging, and immersive

ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",10144963,U24DA041123,"['Affect ', '

"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster

"Integrating Health Records, Genomic, and Social Data to Stratify Adolescent Depression Risk PROJECT ABSTRACT One in five adolescents in the United States will experience a depressive episode before age 18. Early prevention could offset a lifetime of morbidity including work and social impairment, substance use, and suicidal behavior. A critical step to preventing adolescent depression at a population level is the efficient detection of individuals who could benefit most from targeted intervention. However, known risk factors (e.g., subthreshold symptoms, cognitive styles, interpersonal factors) are often not widely assessed in practice until young people are presenting for psychiatric care, and prospective risk screening tools built in traditional research studies remain poorly implemented at scale in clinical settings where it may not be feasible for providers to routinely collect or integrate additional measures. Large-scale, routine electronic health records (EHRs) from major health systems present a powerful opportunity to overcome these prior limitations but have not yet been harnessed for adolescent depression and often lack environmental and genetic data that may inform etiological understanding and risk stratification. The overall aim of this K08 Career Development Award is to leverage large-scale EHR data with linked genomic and social determinants to enhance the systematic identification of young people at elevated risk of depression in real-world health settings. In this project, the candidate will develop and validate a novel phenotype algorithm for identifying adolescent depression cases from a major healthcare system in the United States containing up to 20 years of longitudinal EHR data for over six million individuals (Aim 1); integrate and comprehensively assess a range of potential social and genomic determinants for EHR-based adolescent depression (Aim 2); and apply modern statistical and machine learning methods to train and evaluate an initial prospective risk stratification model for adolescent depression based on routine EHR data (Aim 3). Improving the phenotyping and stratification of adolescent depression in EHRs will facilitate new avenues of research that will be the basis of subsequent R-level grants that include external validation across health systems, refinement of risk stratification and clinical trajectory models, and brief preventive interventions to enhance resilience in those at risk. Supported by a solid foundation in psychiatric and genetic epidemiology and a multidisciplinary team of world-class experts in an ideal environment, the candidate will acquire new expertise in predictive analytics, biomedical informatics (specifically EHR-exposome-genome integration), adolescent depression and prevention science through intensive mentored research and supervised training and professional development activities. This Award will provide the necessary training for the candidate to develop into a fully independent clinically informed investigator with a translational research program that bridges data science, statistical genetics, and developmental epidemiology to inform actionable strategies for early depression prevention and resilience promotion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Leveraging large-scale, readily available electronic health records data from existing routine workflows represents a powerful, untapped opportunity to enhance prevention through the systematic identification of young people at elevated risk of depression. Even a modest improvement in our ability to prospectively stratify risk of adolescent depression at a health systems level could be useful given its prevalence, the current lack of prospective tools that can be implemented at scale, and low burden of potential preventive strategies.","Integrating Health Records, Genomic, and Social Data to Stratify Adolescent Depression Risk",10284131,K08MH127413,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Calibration ', ' Censuses ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity -

"Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent Psychotic-like Experiences in Children: An Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study Analysis PROJECT TITLE Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent Psychotic-like Experiences in Children: An Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My long-term career goal is to establish a highly influential and independent research program and become a broad spectrum leader and innovator in computational psychiatry. I therefore propose the following training goals: 1) To gain formalized training in computational psychiatry methods and statistics, including deep learning and structural equation modeling, 2) to obtain a deeper understanding of the field of developmental psychopathology, and 3) to acquire training in developing and sustaining an independent investigator position with his own laboratory. To meet the first goal, I will meet regularly with University of California Davis (UCD) faculty co-mentors Ian Davidson and Emilio Ferrer, attend relevant UCD classes, and complete a Research Plan with the following Specific Aims: 1) Using deep learning from Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study data (demographic/clinical information, neurocognitive testing, neuroimaging data, and environmental metrics), predict child psychotic-like experience (PLE) distress scores the following year (i.e., baseline data predicting year one PQ-BC distress, year one data predicting year two distress, etc.), and 2) Using rules-based guidance from deep learning using explainable AI (XAI) algorithms, use sequential, structural equation modeling (SEM) of latent profiles (i.e., longitudinal trajectories, e.g., emerging, absent, remitting, persistent) to test hypotheses regarding the longitudinal mechanism(s) which may lead to persistent PLEs in the ABCD cohort. In Aim 1, XAI methods will be used identify the rules used by the deep learner to make decisions; in Aim 2, these rules will then be used to create latent constructs for modeling profiles of longitudinal trajectories. If r2>0.80 is consistently achieved for each iterative analysis in Aim 1, it suggests that ABCD instruments may predict PLE severity one year after measurement at a potentially clinically implementable level and help generate future hypotheses for personalized interventions aimed at reducing risk for persistent PLE distress. For Aim 2, insight will be gained with regard to how brain structure, brain function, neurocognitive ability, and environmental influences interact to influence the time course of PLE expression. To meet the second goal, I will receive mentoring including guided readings via monthly meetings with co-mentor Dr. Ellen Leibenluft, a world-renowned psychiatrist specializing in developmental research and Section Chief at the NIMH. I will also attend developmental classes, seminars, and workshops offered by UCD. To meet the third goal, I will attend weekly meetings with mentor Dr. Cameron Carter, from whom I will gain overarching career guidance. This will include learning how to create and oversee a laboratory, obtaining recommendations for society memberships, acquiring networking opportunities, securing grant sponsorships, and receiving RCR-related guidance. I will also attend mentoring and grantsmanship workshops offered by UCD, attend an off-campus workshop providing hands-on activities to provide exposure to fundamental management skills, complete a formalized UCD RCR plan, and gain mentoring experience by advising a research assistant and postdoc. PROJECT NARRATIVE Child psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are common disturbances of perception and ideation that occur in childhood and that (if they become persistent) may be risk factors for poor mental health in adolescence and beyond. As risk factors that predict persistent PLEs have not been reliably identified, the goal of this study is to use deep learning combined with explainable artificial intelligence to identify features from multimodal data in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study dataset that predict future levels of PLE distress, and then use these features to model PLE trajectories using structured equation modeling. The results of this study will help develop novel, personalized ways to prevent persistent PLEs from developing and ultimately improve mental health.",Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent

PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of early life adversity.",Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents.,10210229,K23MH120437,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', '

"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.

"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,10153459,R01HD092331,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Crime ', ' Criminology ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Firearms ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' New Mexico ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Sociology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' developmental psychology ', ' habitual offender ', ' multiple offender ', ' repeat offender ', ' social ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' correctional system ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Academia ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Security ', ' Pathologic ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' callous unemotional trait ', ' callousness ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' convict ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' high risk ', ' treatment strategy ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' trait impulsivity ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' high dimensionality ', ' protective factors ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' social factors ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' ']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2021,692058,NM-01
"Building a Substance Use Data Commons for Public Health Informatics PROJECT SUMMARY Substance misuse comprises a complex set of conditions, often associated with comorbidities and social factors, that are the root cause of misuse and can lead to poor outcomes. Opioid misuse, non-opioid illicit use, and alcohol misuse can also lead to repeated encounters with hospital emergency departments or first-responders. Although substance use disorders are a leading cause of repeat hospital visits, our fragmented data systems do not generate comprehensive information on the scope and character of this poorly treated condition that would allow providers to improve and monitor the quality of care. Crucial social and behavioral determinants strongly linked with substance use (e.g., pre-hospital behavioral events) are not readily available to health systems, but they are important data that can be used to better train artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) models. In principle, hospitals are well-positioned to address these challenges. In practice, these opportunities are frequently missed given the fragmented structure and design of current data systems. Many patients living with substance misuse visit a specific hospital for the first time after an overdose or a related medical condition of drug use such as infection or trauma. Substance use-related conditions are among the top reasons for repeat visits to the hospital. This supplemental will expand on the existing work of the Parent R01, which is focused in clinical informatics, and build an AI/ML-ready public health informatics Substance Use Data Commons and share a novel, all-inclusive prediction model that will help guide clinical interventions and regional health policy. We aim to foster an academic-public-private collaboration to build a data ecosystem in this supplemental grant that will harmonize data across a Wisconsin regional hospital, pre-hospital agencies like fire, and public health agencies for the first time. We will build a cohort with substance misuse with linked data that are engineered as an AI/ML-ready data commons. During our one-year timeline, we will train and test an AI/ML model that can prioritize those at the highest risk for poor outcomes and uncover important biases in our data sources with input by health equity experts. The following goals are to be accomplished from the supplement proposal: (1) build a Substance Misuse Data Commons across a major hospital system and Wisconsin agencies; (2) develop and validate a machine learning tool for substance use-related health outcomes; and (3) examine model performance across health disparate groups (race/ethnic groups as well as neighborhoods). Access to combined data from hospitals, public health agencies, and first responder agencies could provide a comprehensive data resource that would allow us to reliably identify, risk stratify, and prioritize care for some of Wisconsin's most vulnerable residents through AI/ML modeling. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to establish a comprehensive Substance Use Data Commons that combines health system data with public health agency data for a platform designed for machine learning activities to provide health system and public policy leaders guidance on clinical interventions and regional health policy change. We anticipate that the research proposed will surface important biases and lead to novel tools in artificial intelligence that leverage both the electronic health records (EHR) and pre-hospital data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and Emergency Medical Services. Ultimately, the tools developed from this proposal will be used to address NIH's special research interest (NOT-OD-21-094) to support collaborations that bring together expertise in biomedicine, data management, and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to make NIH-supported data useful and usable for AI/ML analytics",Building a Substance Use Data Commons for Public Health

"Neurobehavioral pathways of polygenic and polyenvironmental effects on the onset and maintenance of substance involvement PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Problematic substance use is associated with significant personal and socioeconomic costs (accounting for approximately 5% of global disease burden and worldwide deaths). Substance use initiation, progression to heavy use, and early onset substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly emerge during adolescence and young adulthood. This developmental period of risk is theorized to result from typical patterns of regionally asynchronous brain maturation (i.e., rapid and early development of limbic regions alongside relatively immature prefrontal and multimodal association cortices) resulting in a diminished ability to suppress inappropriate emotions, desires, and actions when salient environmental cues are present. During later young adulthood the stabilization, reduction, or desistance of heavy use typically occurs alongside maturing cognitive control and emotional regulation abilities coinciding with cortical development. Brain and behavioral maturation may also be influenced by substance use. As genetic and environmental risk factors for substance involvement are predominantly shared across substances, understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying these shared risk factors in a developmental context will broadly improve our etiologic understanding of substance involvement liability and refine treatment and prevention. In this 5-year R01 (responding to PAR-19- 162), we propose to test whether putative behavioral and neural mechanisms of stage-based addiction may link broad spectrum SUD genomic liability and environmental risk to substance involvement trajectories from childhood – young adulthood using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N=11,875 followed from ages 9-16) along with other samples that uniquely extend the temporal scope of ABCD to comprehensively examine brain-behavior developmental interplay related to substance use and misuse (e.g., National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence followed 830 individuals from ages 12-32). Disentangling the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying broad spectrum genetic and environmental liability to SUD will inform our etiologic understanding of substance use initiation, escalation, and desistence that may ultimately contribute to substance-related policy, education, nosology, prevention, and treatment. Primary deliverables from this project will be manuscripts evaluating whether behavior and neural phenotypes may represent mechanisms underlying polygenic and polyenvironmental risk for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Substance use often emerges during early adolescence. In some individuals, it progresses to problematic use and use disorder.

"Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Converging evidence has linked the habenula (Hb), a small epithalamic structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling, to a wide range of affective, motivational, and motor functions. Abnormalities in Hb circuitry are increasingly implicated in psychiatric and behavioral disorders. In vivo Hb research has proceeded slowly, however, due to technical constraints in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that make it difficult to define and characterize this small region. Understanding of the Hb is especially limited in adolescence, a critical period marked by rapid maturation of the reward system and, often, the first emergence of psychiatric disorders. To address these gaps in basic and clinical neuroscience, our proposal leverages the unprecedented scale and quality of high-resolution neuroimaging data available through the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the development of Hb function in early adolescence and its role in psychiatric illness onset. The proposed research builds on extensive work by our group to develop and refine Hb imaging methodology, including automated segmentation and a region of interest optimization approach that significantly improves Hb fMRI sensitivity, and is supported by substantial data from our laboratory. In independent samples of adult and adolescent healthy controls (HCs), we found a highly consistent pattern of positive Hb intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), downstream nucleus accumbens (NAc), and cortical salience network (SN), as well as negative Hb iFC throughout the default mode network (DMN). Adults with high vs. low subclinical depression scores exhibited distinct iFC patterns with regions associated with anxiety and depression, including the amygdala and insula. Moreover, adolescents with mood and anxiety disorders had positive Hb iFC with the DMN, and this abnormal Hb-DMN iFC pattern was associated with anxiety severity across both healthy and clinical adolescents, while hyperconnectivity with SN and other expected Hb targets correlated with anhedonia. Building on our compelling findings to date, we propose to study Hb function at Baseline and Year 2 ABCD neuroimaging timepoints in relation to normative (Aim 1) and clinical (Aim 2) developmental trajectories. Subjects will comprise two cohorts of ~3000 adolescents each: clinical subjects, with significant past or current mood and anxiety symptoms, and HCs, with no history of psychiatric diagnoses or clinically significant symptoms. Study procedures will incorporate sophisticated preprocessing and denoising, optimized subject-level Hb definition, neuroanatomically accurate cortical surface mapping, and rigorous non-parametric statistics. Analyses will encompass both resting-state and task fMRI to characterize Hb iFC and activation during specific reward, loss, and inhibitory control processes. We will examine both group differences and associations with psychiatric symptom severity using hypothesis-driven as well as machine learning approaches.  PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to advance basic and clinical neuroscientific understanding of the habenula, a small structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling and is increasingly implicated in psychiatric disorders. The technical difficulty of studying the habenula has limited in vivo research, especially in adolescent populations where psychiatric symptoms often first emerge.

"Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Adolescent depression is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We know that adolescent depression varies considerably in severity and course, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This proposal addresses this concern, aiming to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in adolescents to inform treatment influencing its course. Our overall hypothesis is that reward dysfunction and its underlying neuro-immunological mechanisms contribute to maintenance of depression in youth. We propose the following model: (1) peripheral inflammation (e.g., cytokines, kynurenines) is associated with anhedonia; (2) inflammation extends to the CNS, inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neuro-chemical changes alter the reward circuitry, leading to anhedonia, and contribute to depression progression. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia—reflecting deficits in reward processes—and not irritability was associated with worse outcome, including suicidality and chronicity. We also reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), we showed that decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA in adolescent depression was driven by anhedonia. Additionally, using fMRI, we mapped striatal-based connectivity in relation to anhedonia and documented distinct neural activation patterns of reward anticipation and attainment—both reward processes that contribute to anhedonia. In pilot studies, we found that ACC GABA and reward- anticipation brain activation predicted anhedonia severity at 2-year follow-up. Building upon our compelling findings to date, we propose a prospective study of reward processes and neuroimmunological mechanisms, with the goal to identify modifiable pathways predictive of depression course in adolescents. We will study 120 adolescents with depressive symptoms. Three in-laboratory comprehensive clinical evaluation and computerized reward task sessions will be done at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. At baseline and 12 months, visits will include: a) immune blood collection for kynurenine metabolites, immune cell profiling, and cytokine secretion post immune stimulation (as a biological stressor); b) fMRI resting state and tasks examining distinct reward processes (e.g., anticipation, attainment, learning); and c) 1H MRS to probe ACC GABA and striatal GSH as indices for inflammatory neurometabolic consequences in reward-related brain regions. Outcome measures will include anhedonia severity (primary), along with depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and suicidality. Principled variable selection approach will address multiple comparison concerns. Dynamic causal modeling and machine learning classification methods will explore the relationships among all examined factors.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the maintenance and severity of adolescent depression. A prospective multimodal study will test the overall hypothesis that reward dysfunction and associated neuroimmunological abnormalities contribute to depression progression in youth. Such work would provide information on modifiable factors to facilitate novel treatment approaches influencing the course of illness early on and prior to chronicity effects, so that we may work to ameliorate morbidity and mortality of this devastating disorder.",Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression,10128500,R01MH120601,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Anxiety ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Gambling ', ' Glutathione ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kynurenine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Puberty ', ' Public Health ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Anhedonia ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Peripheral ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' pleasure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Collection ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' reward circuitry ', ' computerized ', ' subthreshold depression ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Trauma ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' primary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' behavioral construct ', ' behavior construct ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' reward anticipation ', ' ']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,786200,NY-14
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !
