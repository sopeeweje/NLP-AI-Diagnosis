"Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Edilberto Amorim is a neurologist with subspecialty training in critical care and epilepsy who aims to employ biomedical technology innovations in brain monitoring to personalize treatment for patients with hypoxic- ischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest. This career development award and its rigorous curriculum will establish Dr. Amorim as a clinician-scientist with independent expertise in: 1) Deep learning applied to physiology time-series, 2) Causal inference for observational data, and 3) Quantitative brain imaging. Every year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cardiac arrest. Brain injury is the number one cause of death for patients surviving initial resuscitation, and refractory seizures and other seizure-like brain activity are diagnosed in up to 50% of patients. Despite being a common complication, outcomes are dismal and current treatment strategies for seizures post-cardiac arrest are limited. Dr. Amorim aims to identify physiology-driven biomarkers of resilience to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by utilizing state-of-the-art computational methods and a massive EEG and neuroimaging dataset with >1,500 subjects. His central hypothesis is that specific time- dependent changes in spike and accompanying EEG activity during cardiac arrest treatment predict seizure control and, ultimately, neurological recovery. The primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify early longitudinal epileptiform EEG phenotypes predictive of neurological recovery using interpretable and deep learning algorithms; 2) Establish quantitative EEG biomarkers of seizure treatment response to anesthetics; and 3) Estimate the causal effect of rapid seizure treatment with anesthetics in preventing structural brain injury quantified with brain MRI. Dr. Amorim has generated preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling EEG phenotypes longitudinally for outcome prediction and has applied quantitative EEG biomarkers to predict degree of brain injury on brain MRI. His primary mentor in this proposal will be Dr. Edward Chang, a neuroscientist and leader in human neurophysiology research. His co-mentors will include Dr. Brandon Westover, an authority in machine learning applied to critical care EEG, and Dr. Donna Ferriero, an accomplished translational and neuroimaging investigator in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Additional mentoring in quantitative neuroimaging (Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan) and biostatistics (Dr. Charles McCulloch) will be essential components of his training. These aims are expected to establish early non-invasive predictive biomarkers of neurological recovery and seizure control that may: 1) Guide patient selection for clinical trials enrichment and 2) Serve as target to therapeutic interventions after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. By leveraging the deep expertise of a cross-disciplinary group of world-class mentors and the unparalleled innovation environments of the University of California, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Dr. Amorim will be ideally positioned to uncover fundamental knowledge about epileptogenesis after acute brain injury as well as spearhead clinical trials focused on improving outcomes meaningful to cardiac arrest patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiac arrest impacts the lives of 500,000 Americans every year, and nearly half of patients surviving the initial resuscitation will develop seizures or seizure-like brain activity as a complication of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We aim to reduce secondary brain injury and neurological disability from seizures after cardiac arrest by personalizing seizure treatment using EEG and brain MRI biomarkers of neuro-recovery. We expect that the outcome of the proposed studies will provide critical knowledge about epileptogenesis after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury andguide the development of goal-directed seizure treatment and patient selection in future clinical trials.",Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest,10105883,K23NS119794,"['Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', '

"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,10198042,R01NS084142,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Masks ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Study models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Terminology ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' millimeter ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' voltage ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Impact Seizures ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' lobes ', ' Lobe ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' parallel computer ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computing ', ' minimally invasive ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,612436,NY-13
"Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for the Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Project Summary / Abstract  Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy with cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) often leading to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for medically intractable focal onset seizures (FOS), this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) is a feasible strategy to treat LGS. Specifically, the project aims to: (1) acquire preliminary evidence for safety and efficacy in treating GOS of LGS with RNS-TCN; (2) create an interactive therapy-decision support system based on patient-specific computational network models and machine learning to identify optimal lead placement and stimulation parameters.  Using the RNS® System, which is FDA approved for FOS, an early feasibility IDE study will be conducted at 6 epilepsy centers in 20 patients with LGS and medically intractable GOS. The patients will be enrolled in two cohorts of 10, with safety and efficacy milestones in the first cohort governing the enrollment of the second cohort. Patients will have two depth leads placed bilaterally in the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus and two subdural strip leads placed bilaterally on the medial prefrontal cortex. These targets are selected because they are implicated in the onset and spread of GOS in LGS. Leads will be located within each target such that stimulation maximally engages the thalamocortical network, guided by finite-element biophysical models created from structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging. The finite-element biophysical models will also be used to identify the initial RNS-TCN stimulation pathway and current amplitude. During the blinded evaluation period patients will be randomized to receive either high-frequency short burst (HFSB) or low-frequency long burst (LFLB) RNS-TCN, then enter a washout period before crossing over to receive the other treatment condition. During the open label period stimulation parameters can be modified at the discretion of the physician. Parameter adjustments will be informed by using a Bayesian optimization model developed for specifically for each patient. All clinical and electrophysiological data collected during the study will be used to identify a biomarker of clinical response; if found, these will aid future epilepsy research and clinical practice. If safety is favorable and there is preliminary evidence for efficacy, then this early experience will inform the design of a future larger feasibility study.  In addition to treating a population in need, this project engages in fundamental discovery of biomarkers in generalized network epilepsies, and develops novel automated therapy selection policies that have the potential to improve the lives of patients with LGS and other seizure disorders.

"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10224663,F31NS115447,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hospitals ', ' Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Savings ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Neurologist ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' electronic structure ', ' candidate identification ', ' Patient risk ', ' prospective test ', ' novel drug class ', ' new drug class ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' automated analysis ', ' structured data ', ' learning classifier ', ' magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography ', ' MRI/EEG ', ' ']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2021,40133,OH-01
"Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP) The advent of next generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized gene discovery in human diseases, including epilepsy. Hundreds of genes have been implicated in epilepsy in the last decade, revealing the diversity of biological mechanisms that can go awry in this disorder. However, the rate at which we are identifying new genes involved in epilepsy is now outpacing our ability to study disease mechanisms. Moreover, clinical gene panel or exome sequencing has become standard practice for patients with early-onset, familial, and refractory epilepsies. This rapid assimilation of genetic testing into clinical care has led to a surge in the number of genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS), particularly the occurrence of missense VUS. These VUS are assigned to an indeterminate spectrum between pathogenic and benign, which complicate interpretation for genetic counselors, clinicians, patients and families, as well as assessment of the need for further testing. Here we propose a Center without Walls, entitled Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP), spanning 5 institutions and incorporating expertise from geneticists, clinicians, computational biologists, neuroscientists, stem cell biologists, pharmacologists and electrophysiologists who have a proven track record of collaborative publications and grants, as well as stature as leaders of national and international epilepsy organizations. EpiMVP will develop a modular, highly integrated platform approach to accelerate determination of the functional, pharmacological, neuronal network and whole animal consequences of genetic variants implicated in a range of clinical epilepsy types. We will study non-ion-channel, non-receptor genes commonly implicated in epilepsy, and that are involved in diverse biological processes. Our ultimate goals are to devise an effective experimental platform for testing the pathogenicity of VUS in genes implicated in epilepsy and to generate a computational model (EpiPred) that predicts the likelihood that a variant is pathogenic or benign. This work is crucial in the pursuit of novel therapeutics and the promise of personalized medicine. The overall milestones of the Center are: 1. Evaluate genes associated with epilepsy and select candidates for analysis, model data for, and analyze all project data for development of EpiPred an iterative machine learning model to classify variants in genes implicated in epilepsy. 2. Test selected VUS using medium throughput, in vitro approaches. 3. Test selected VUS in human cortical neurons or human brain organoids using induced pluripotent stem cell approaches. 4. Test selected VUS in pre-clinical, in vivo models. The expected outcomes are: 1. Provide a freely available prediction tool for clinicians to differentiate between pathogenic and benign variants for genes implicated in epilepsy; 2. Provide experimental models to study the functional consequences of specific variants; 3. Provide a reclassification of VUS in ClinVar/ClinGen and to develop new guidelines for incorporating functional readouts into the ACMG criteria; 4. Inform the future development of novel therapeutics to treat epilepsy.

"Advancing SUDEP risk prediction using a multicenter case-control approach Project Summary Patients with epilepsy have a 25-fold elevated risk of sudden death. Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common disease-related cause of premature mortality in people with seizure disorders, affecting 1 of every 1000 patients annually. Despite this, mechanisms and risk factors of SUDEP remain largely unknown. Having ongoing generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and no nocturnal supervision are the only definite risk factors, and reducing seizures is the only currently available preventive strategy. Several other clinical factors and potential biomarkers such as prolonged post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) that follows GTCS, abnormal inter-ictal ECG, and structural brain MRI abnormalities were associated with increased SUDEP risk, but none were rigorously confirmed in a large case-control study. While limitations of single-center studies in accumulating a sufficient number of cases are well recognized, prospective multicenter studies are also severely limited by the time, expense, and loss of follow-up constraining sample size and power. To sidestep these limitations, we propose a retrospective multisite case-control study that will screen >40,000 patients from 86 epilepsy monitoring centers worldwide, with a conservative expected total of >185 SUDEP cases and 370 age/sex-matched controls. Employing our comprehensive approaches to identify SUDEP cases combined with novel data harmonization techniques will allow us to: 1) provide an unprecedentedly large curated dataset of SUDEP, 2) identify clinical, electrophysiological, and imaging predictors of SUDEP using advanced machine learning methods, and 3) develop an individualized model to predict SUDEP risk that can be used in clinic. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that SUDEP cases exhibit different electroclinical and imaging characteristics that can provide an individualized prediction model. We will identify ictal electroclinical and interictal electrophysiological and neuroimaging biomarkers of SUDEP. We will compare markers of seizure severity between SUDEP cases and age/sex-matched living epilepsy patients, including decerebrate or decorticate posturing during GTCS, PGES duration, postictal bradycardia + asystole and post-convulsive central apnea. Additionally, we will assess putative interictal biomarkers including decreased low frequency power in ECG heart rate variability and decreased MRI-derived volumes in the right hippocampus/amygdala and brainstem. We will also employ machine-learning techniques to uncover novel biomarkers from interictal electrophysiological data. Finally, using a Bayesian framework, we will develop an individualized SUDEP risk prediction tool that combines clinical features with measures derived from routine EEG, ECG, and MRI. Our goal is to create a SUDEP case-control dataset to identify clinical risk factors and biomarkers that will help to create a robust model of an individual’s SUDEP risk based on measures derived from routine clinical care and testing such as interictal ECG, MRI and EEG. Such a tool could transform clinical practice, facilitate trials of SUDEP interventions, and ultimately save lives. Project Narrative One in 1000 people with epilepsy die every year due to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Identifying risk factors associated with SUDEP remains challenging due to the lack of large controlled datasets enabling rigorous analyses and development of comprehensive prediction models. Our study will address this critical unmet need by screening records of >40,000 patients from >85 epilepsy centers worldwide to obtain a nearly order of magnitude more cases and controls than any prior study, and applying innovative methods to test candidate biomarkers, leading to better understanding of SUDEP mechanisms and developing individualized risk models to better target patients for counseling and interventions.",Advancing SUDEP risk prediction using a multicenter case-control approach,10290017,R01NS123928,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Seizures ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Sample Size ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Bradycardia ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' grand mal seizure ', ' Tonic -

"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10372655,R43NS119015,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Blinking ', ' eye blink ', ' eyeblink ', ' Capital ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Gold ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Shark ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' grand mal seizure ', ' Tonic - clonic seizures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Devices ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Advanced Development ', ' software systems ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' improved outcome ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' algorithm development ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital health ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2021,52000,CA-13
"Identifying brain networks to predict treatment resistance and post-surgical outcome: An ENIGMA-Epilepsy initiative ABSTRACT  Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness that affects over 50 million people worldwide. Approximately one-third of patients do not respond to anti-seizure medication (ASM) and require additional diagnostic work-up, including consideration for surgery. Structural neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic evaluation of epilepsy, identifying visible lesions in many patients that co-localize with the seizure focus. However, up to 40% of patients have normal-appearing MRIs and this number is growing. As a result, there is increased interest in identifying subtle brain network abnormalities that could help to delineate the epileptogenic network and aid in the prediction of treatment response (i.e., response to ASMs and surgical outcomes). Unfortunately, methods for reliably identifying which patients will be drug-responsive versus drug- resistant, and which patients will achieve successful versus unsuccessful surgical outcomes are lacking.  A major barrier to progress in this field has been obtaining quantitative imaging, including structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (dMRI), clinical, and genetic data on large, geographically diverse samples of patients in whom different treatment outcomes can be evaluated. In the past, sample sizes have been insufficient to detect subtle, but reliable, brain abnormalities in patients with focal or generalized epilepsies that are genuinely associated with epilepsy and not with vicissitudes related to small or geographically restricted samples.  A new, large-scale data initiative, ENIGMA4-Epilepsy, coupled with technological advancements that enable improved data harmonization are now lifting these barriers and allowing us to combine multi-site sMRI/dMRI, clinical, genetic data to predict important clinical outcomes, and making the results generalizable to a global epilepsy community. In this grant, we will leverage data collected through ENIGMA-Epilepsy—a consortium of 24 epilepsy centers from 14 countries (more than 2,250 patient and 1,727 healthy control sMRI/dMRI datasets) and the Human Epilepsy Project (HEP). We will include new network models (i.e., individualized connectomes) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test whether a combination of imaging, clinical, and genetic risk can accurately predict two clinical outcomes: drug-resistance and post-operative seizure outcome. Our scientific premise is that MRI-based assessment of whole-brain network properties, in combination with clinical data and PRS derived from genetic data, are able to predict (i) drug response in recently diagnosed epilepsy cases and (ii) postsurgical outcomes in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy.  This R01 addresses NIH's call for more reproducible studies by introducing a highly-powered design capable of capturing variability across patients with diverse clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes. This grant is also directly aligned with NINDS's 2020 Epilepsy Benchmarks (IIIB), which encourage the identification of genetic, clinical, and imaging biomarkers capable of predicting treatment response in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness, affecting over 50 million people world-wide. In this project, we will leverage the ENIGMA-Epilepsy infrastructure to address how quantitative, non-invasive neuroimaging, clinical and genetic data can be used to predict (1) which patients will respond to anti-seizure medications versus which will remain drug-resistant and (2) which patients will achieve favorable versus unfavorable surgical outcomes. The research will be accomplished by applying a series of hypothesis-driven and data- driven (i.e., machine learning) approaches to clinical and imaging data on an exceptionally large cohort of patients with common epilepsy syndromes, providing unprecedented power to tackle critical treatment-related questions in epilepsy.",Identifying brain networks to predict treatment resistance and

"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control.

"Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data Project Summary For epileptic patients who undergo brain resection or ablation interventions, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate seizure status, whether controlled or relapsed. Yet, it is data from the preoperative brain that drives the postoperative prediction process – a critical process for both patient and doctor, and one that is only clinically meaningful when seizure outcomes are predicted presurgically to optimize surgical-decision making. Accordingly, we propose to develop a multi-step model that will establish more accurate predictors of post- surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) emphasizing post-surgical status, for it is the areas of the brain spared during surgery that form the neural substrates generating postoperative seizures. A second perspective motivating our project is the need to identify those changes in functional and structural brain network organization that support adaptive versus maladaptive seizure outcomes following brain surgery. These are the network changes (e.g., the new seizure generators) that dispose and place a potential surgical candidate on a specific outcome trajectory. Therefore, identifying the phenotypes of brain reorganization and change, and incorporating their status into presurgical predictive models of outcome will likely prove crucial to enhancing our ability to predict postoperative neuroplastic responses. While existing outcome prediction models in TLE have focused on clinical variables (e.g., lesional status), we choose instead to focus on structural and functional measures of network reorganization (communication dynamics, regional interactions, structural control). This stems from our belief that capturing network changes throughout the whole postsurgical brain offers a better practical method for identifying and predicting the latent seizure foci (epileptogenesis) that will emerge after surgery. Through machine learning techniques we will deliver an algorithm to be used with new, potential surgical patients, an algorithm that utilizes solely presurgical data, but incorporates our innovative prediction about postsurgical brain organization. Accordingly, our approach provides both a methodologic and conceptual (reorganization phenotypes) advance. The scientific premise leading to our hypotheses is that the failure in the literature to account for the impact of unresected/ablated brain regions, and the brain reorganizations these areas compel, has seriously impeded the predictive power of previous outcome models. Project Narrative For epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate whether seizures are controlled or not. Accordingly, we propose to develop a model that predicts post-surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy, emphasizing the reorganization and change in brain network communication and control that comes with post-surgical status, for it is these features that will actually generate postsurgical seizures. Our innovation is the use of post-operative brain reorganization phenotypes to predict on a presurgical basis who will be disposed to a good vs poor outcome trajectory, highlighting that it is the failure to account for the impact of spared regions, and the brain organization changes these compel, which has seriously impeded the predictive power of prior outcome models.",Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data,10134456,R01NS112816,"['Algorithms ', ' Belief ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Generalized Epilepsy ', ' Generalized Seizure Disorder ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Rest ', ' Seizures ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Organizational Change ', ' base ', ' brain surgery ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' stem ', ' standard measure ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' recruit ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,442761,PA-03
"Interictal High Frequency Oscillations of Epileptogenecity in Pediatric Patients Project Summary Crucial to the success of epilepsy surgery is the availability of a robust presurgical biomarker to identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Complete resection of the EZ may lead to medication and seizure freedom. Since the EZ cannot be measured directly, its location is estimated indirectly based on concordant data from a multitude of noninvasive tests. Yet, the results of these tests are often insufficiently concordant or inconclusive. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) serves as the gold standard for the delineation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). However, the SOZ does not always predict the surgical outcome, and its delineation requires many days of recordings to capture clinical seizures. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded with iEEG are promising interictal biomarkers of the EZ. Yet, their clinical value for epilepsy surgery is still debated since the HFO-generating area is often relatively large and its complete resection may overlap with eloquent areas. This is often attributed to the presence of physiological HFOs in non-epileptogenic areas. In our recent iEEG study, we showed that interictal HFOs are initiated by an onset generator and spread to other brain areas over time. This generator constitutes a promising interictal biomarker of the EZ since its resection is associated with good surgical outcome. Despite the copious literature on HFOs, the clinical value of HFOs for surgery has been only investigated using iEEG, which presents serious limitations due to its invasiveness and its limited spatial sampling. This application aims to noninvasively localize interictal HFOs with high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs, and assess the noninvasive localization of the HFO-onset generator with respect to the surgical resection and patients’ outcome. Our hypothesis is that HD-EEG and MEG can distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs non-invasively and can localize the HFO-onset generator whose removal leads to better surgical outcome than the removal of the area of secondary spread. To test our hypothesis, we specifically aim to: (i) assess the ability of HD-EEG and MEG to localize HFOs; (ii) differentiate physiological (nHFOs) from pathological (pHFOs) HFOs using unsupervised machine learning; (iii) localize noninvasively the HFO-onset generator and compare it with the clinical gold standard for resection tailoring, i.e. the iEEG-defined SOZ; and (iv) assess the predictive value of the HFO- onset generator in terms of surgical outcome. To pursue these aims, we will record HD-EEG and MEG data from 50 children (0-18 years old) with MRE and 50 typically developing (TD) children. This application combines the use of cutting-edge pediatric neuroimaging instruments, 3D printing technology, and innovative signal processing tools together with extensive neuroimaging experience with children. Our research will have a direct impact on the life of children with MRE since it will provide a new noninvasive biomarker of the EZ that would limit invasive long-term monitoring, augment presurgical planning, and improve the surgical outcome. Narrative To lessen the negative impact of medically refractory epilepsy in children, a new pre-surgical noninvasive biomarker that identifies reliably the area of the brain that generates the epileptic seizures is essential. The proposed experiments are relevant to public health because they may lead to a significant improvement of the presurgical evaluation procedure and postsurgical outcome of pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. The project is relevant to NINDS’s mission because the resulting findings could significantly improve the quality of life in children with epilepsy, one of the most common pediatric neurological disorders, which has a major impact on children’s development and may significantly affect their adult life.",Interictal High Frequency Oscillations of Epileptogenecity in Pediatric Patients,9944685,R01NS104116,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Gold ', ' Head ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Resected ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' signal processing ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,COOK CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,428636,TX-12
"Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors ABSTRACT Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C) using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for continuous use in all facets of daily life. Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE 1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists. In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary. In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of $380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures. These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability. Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy. This grant proposal aims to create a digital health platform that includes a wearable medical device worn on the scalp below the hairline. The system detects and counts seizures, and alerts to seizures in real time.

"Predicting epilepsy in cerebral malaria: working toward identifying biomarkers of epileptogenesis in children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over half a million children suffer from cerebral malaria annually, with up to 10-16% of this population developing epilepsy within two years. Thus, cerebral malaria contributes significantly to the global epilepsy burden. As in many acquired epilepsies, there remains an important gap in knowledge on how to identify which children after cerebral malaria infection will be at risk for epilepsy development. Identification of biomarkers heralding epilepsy risk would improve timely identification of who would most benefit from closer clinical monitoring- a critical consideration for improved allocation of the limited available resources in regions where this disease is most prevalent. Identification of the specific clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) metrics which confer risk of post- malaria epilepsy will also importantly help understand epilepsy development in this disease. Studying these processes in acquired epilepsies has proven difficult to date due to the varied nature of etiologies and timing of epilepsy development after brain insult. Cerebral malaria has potential to be a unique model for identification of epileptogenesis biomarkers, as it is a single disease state with a high rate of post-epilepsy development within a relatively short time frame. This proposal will address key gaps in knowledge regarding the utility of clinical and EEG metrics readily available in resource-limited settings for predictive ability to prognosticate epilepsy risk in children with cerebral malaria. The findings have the potential to lay the foundation for future research of targeted interventions directed toward reducing post-cerebral malaria epilepsy development. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award application aligns with two of the benchmarks set by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and American Epilepsy Society, including Area II- understanding epileptogenesis, and Area III- identify biomarkers. This proposal is also designed to provide important opportunities for the training and career development of the candidate. Dr. Patel has experience in global neurology research and clinical neurophysiology; this award will allow her to gain further experience in clinical research methodology and specific training in computational analysis of EEG. These skills will lay a foundation for further study of this condition and potentially in anti-epileptogenesis trials of the post-cerebral malaria epilepsy model. Ultimately, this research proposal and the accompanying training will provide a strong foundation for a successful independent research career devoted to the understanding of epileptogenesis and reducing the risk of acquired epilepsies in children globally. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral malaria continues to impact over half a million children annually, with 10-16% developing epilepsy within 2 years, and as such is a large contributor to the global epilepsy burden worldwide. This proposal will use cerebral malaria as model of acquired epilepsy, studying the ability of acute and recovery phase quantitative EEG measures in combination with clinical metrics in prediction of post- cerebral malaria epilepsy development.

"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,10131881,R01NS112497,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Meningoencephalitis ', ' Cerebromeningitis ', ' Encephalomeningitis ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motivation ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Lesion ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' prospective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinical practice ', ' signal processing ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' computational intelligence ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2021,459231,TX-18

It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10192851,K23NS112596,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cognition ', ' Complication ', ' Contusions ', ' Bruise ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Post-Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Post-Traumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Posttraumatic Epilepsy ', ' Posttraumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Targeting pathologic spike-ripples to isolate and disrupt epileptic dynamics Project Summary Epilepsy is the world’s most common, serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For one-third of patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite maximal medical management. In these patients, seizures often arise from a localized brain region, and neurosurgical interventions are the most effective treatment option. When successful, surgical interventions provide cure from seizures, and also prevent or reverse the disabling consequences of uncontrolled seizures. Critical to successful intervention is accurate identification of the core tissue responsible for generating seizures (i.e., the epileptogenic zone). Traditionally, this tissue would be surgically resected, but modern approaches aim to focally disrupt this tissue with targeted electrical stimulation (i.e. neuromodulation). Improvements in epilepsy care are now limited by (i) the inability to accurately identify the epileptogenic zone; (ii) a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying epileptiform activity; (iii) a lack of understanding of how to target these mechanisms with neurostimulation. The most common approach to identify the epileptogenic zone is through continuous recording of a patient’s cortical electrical activity to capture seizures. However, because seizures are infrequent, this approach is expensive, time consuming, and unpleasant for patients. Moreover, this approach often fails to identify the epileptogenic zone, resulting in unsuccessful neurosurgical intervention in 20-70% of cases. To address this, interictal biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone that manifest between seizures are required. Two such biomarkers have been proposed: (a) interictal discharges or spikes, and (b) high frequency oscillations or ripples. While both signals have been extensively studied, neither accurately delimits the epileptogenic zone. Spikes are specific for epilepsy, but too spatially diffuse to identify the epileptogenic zone. Ripples are spatially focal, but represent both pathologic and physiologic processes. We address these limitations by focusing on the simultaneous occurrence of a spike and ripple, “spike-ripple” discharges, as an improved biomarker for the epileptogenic zone. Spike-ripples commonly occur in patients with epilepsy, improve the spatial specificity of spikes for the epileptogenic zone, and disentangle physiologic from pathologic ripples. Our interdisciplinary team will apply expertise in epilepsy, neurophysiology, neurosurgery, animal experiments, modeling, and statistics to: (i) develop a fully automated spike-ripple detector and compare its clinical utility to predict surgical outcome to spikes and ripples alone, (ii) identify the biological mechanisms that generate spike-ripple discharges using novel voltage imaging techniques in animal models combined with computational models; and (iii) develop principled neurostimulation protocols to disrupt the mechanisms that generate spike-ripples. Completion of these Aims will represent significant progress towards resolving fundamental questions in modern epilepsy research, an understanding of mechanisms in the core epileptogenic network that generate spike-ripples, and a principled approach to neurostimulation to focally disrupt these pathologic dynamics. Project Narrative Neurosurgical treatment of epilepsy often fails, and neurostimulation to treat epilepsy remains suboptimal and ad hoc. Identification of an improved biomarker - to target epilepsy treatment and assess treatment efficacy - is required. This project combines clinical data from human patients, experiments in animal models, and computer simulations of brain activity to develop an improved biomarker for epilepsy treatment, and to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the pathological brain dynamics in epilepsy.",Targeting pathologic spike-ripples to isolate and disrupt epileptic dynamics,10096727,R01NS119483,"['Action Potentials ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Caring ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Refractory ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' human data ', ' voltage ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Institution ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Resected ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Consumption ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' successful intervention ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,698329,MA-08
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT:

"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools PROJECT SUMMARY  Epilepsy is one of the world’s most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) they are difficult to find; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. In the past funding period, we developed and validated an HFO detection algorithm that overcomes the first obstacle, and allowed us acquire a massive database of HFOs that have opened new avenues of research. In this proposal, we will leverage that algorithm to move HFOs towards clinical translation. In the first Aim, we apply advanced functional connectivity techniques to quantify the network properties of HFOs. Our data, which comprise HFOs from the entire hospitalization and fully curated metadata, are ideal for robust analyses of this new area of HFO research. The second Aim addresses a longstanding, and still unsolved problem in HFO research: how to discern when HFOs are due to epileptic processes versus normal physiology? Our past funding period identified some potential methods to identify pathological HFOs, but also crucial caveats that must be addressed prior to clinical implementation. This Aim will combine multiple classification methods with state-of-the-art machine learning tools to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. It will also conduct a large human expert classification of HFOs using clinical EEG software, to start involving epilepsy clinicians in the direct evaluation of HFOs. The third Aim will further develop the translational potential of HFOs, incorporating our unique longitudinal clinical data to characterize the effects of medications, sleep, and other time-varying effects on HFO rates. It will then incorporate these and all prior HFO data into a rigorous latent class model to predict how likely each channel is to be epileptic. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies using HFOs to guide prospective clinical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide.

"Acute Modulation of Stereotyped High Frequency Oscillations with a Closed-Loop Brain Interchange System in Drug Resistant Epilepsy Project Summary: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) of intracranial EEG (iEEG) have the potential to identify the surgical resection area/seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with drug resistant epilepsy. However, multiple reports indicate that HFOs can be generated not only by epileptic cerebral tissue but also by non-epileptic sites often including eloquent regions such as motor, visual and language cortices. In this project, we present the initial evidence of a recurrent waveform pattern that may be sufficient to distinguish pathological HFOs from physiological ones. Specifically, we show that the SOZ repeatedly generates sets of stereotypical HFOs with similar waveform morphology whereas the events recorded from out of SOZ were irregular. This morphological pattern served as a robust neurobiomarker to isolate SOZ from other brain areas in multiple patients consistently. While these promising preliminary results are in place, the functional utility of stereotyped HFOs in a closed-loop seizure control system remains unknown. As of today, not much is known whether the stereotyped HFOs generated by the SOZ can be detected with an implantable system. If this can be achieved, then HFOs can be strategically translated as a neurobiomarker into closed-loop seizure control applications. We hypothesize that pathologic stereotyped HFOs can be captured with the implantable Brain Interchange (BIC) system of CorTec and spatial topography of these events can be utilized by the implantable system to deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. Using an acute setup within the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), this project will investigate the feasibility of capturing stereotyped HFO events using the new BIC system and compare the detection results to those obtained with the commercially available amplifier. If the first phase (Aim-1) of our study becomes successful, later in the second phase (Aim-2), once again in the EMU, we will deliver targeted electrical stimulation to those brain sites associated with stereotyped HFOs using the BIC. We will investigate the modulatory effects of this closed-loop stimulation strategy by monitoring the changes in signature events such as spikes, epileptic discharges, ripples and fast ripples. If successful, this closed-loop system does not have to wait for a seizure to start in order to deliver the stimulation at its onset as done by the RNS system of Neuropace. In contrast, the system will monitor the spatial topography and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these areas to prevent seizures from occurring. If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our methods with the implanted BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting. 1 Project Narrative Overall, this proposal will investigate the functional utility of stereotyped HFOs by capturing them with a new implantable system (Brain Interchange - BIC of CorTec), which can sample neural data at higher rates >=1kHz and deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. In contrast to current closed-loop systems (RNS), which wait for the seizure to start before delivering stimulation, the BIC system will monitor the spatial topography and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these HFO generating areas to prevent seizures from occurring. If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our methods with the implantable BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting. 1",Acute Modulation of Stereotyped High Frequency Oscillations with a Closed-Loop Brain Interchange System in Drug Resistant Epilepsy,10290984,UH3NS117944,"['Amplifiers ', ' Austria ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Seizures ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Visual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Neurologic Deficit ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' neurotechnology ', ' clinical practice ', ' neural implant ', ' brain implant ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,UH3,2021,980214,TX-18
"Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy More than 1/3 of the world’s 65 million people with epilepsy (~3.3 million in the U.S.) have seizures that cannot be controlled by medications. Surgery and implanted devices are options for many, but their success depends upon manually mapping epileptic networks, which is only possible for some patients, and poorly standardized. When surgical targets are identified, there is currently no rigorous way to select the best surgical approach. The overall aim of this proposal is to develop rigorous, standardized, quantitative methods to: (1) map epileptic networks from imaging and Stereo EEG (SEEG), (2) pick the best region for resection, ablation or neuromodulation for individual patients from their data and clinical hypotheses, and (3) to determine when focal intervention is unlikely to succeed. These methods would have tremendous positive impact on clinical care. Over the first four years of this grant we have made substantial progress towards these goals. Our deliverables include: (1) robust measures derived from intracranial EEG (IEEG) that predict outcome from epilepsy surgery; (2) personalized methods that localize epileptic networks and predict the impact of different interventions on seizure control; (3) tools that predict the path of seizure spread from combined MRI and iEEG; and (4) a track record of openly sharing our methods, data, results and code on our platform http: //ieeg.org. In the next phase, we propose innovative solutions to 3 fundamental challenges in epilepsy surgery required to translate our work into practice: (1) Guiding SEEG: We must adapt our methods to the sparser sampling and different philosophy of stereo EEG, which maps a network of connected brain regions and tests clinical hypotheses about where seizures initiate and propagate; (2) Assessing sampling bias and missing information: We will develop methods to determine if electrodes sample all key regions of the epileptic network, to ensure we do not falsely localize due to missing information; (3) Validating in a larger population across centers: In parallel to refining the above methods, we will validate and optimize our analyses in a large number of patients to ready this work for a prospective clinical trial. In a novel model, we have engaged a group of major surgical epilepsy centers to openly collaborate, standardize methods, aggregate data, and share all algorithms, computer code, data and results on http: //ieeg.org. Our central hypothesis is that standardized, quantitative methods to guide epilepsy surgery can improve patient outcomes, lower morbidity, reduce cost and enable uniform, higher quality care across centers. This work is significant because it merges state of the art network neuroscience, engineering, neurology and neurosurgery to make practical tools to improve and standardize patient care. This project leverages a thriving collaboration between experts in neurology, computational neuroscience, neurosurgery, neuroimaging and bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania that has generated 58 publications related to this proposal. We now extend this collaboration to academic epilepsy centers across the United States and worldwide. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing new quantitative methods to target and test epilepsy surgery in computer models before doing these procedures in the operating room will improve patient outcomes and reduce surgery side effects and costs. In this research we are also working with 15 major epilepsy centers to standardize treatment. For these reasons the proposal is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission to foster fundamental, creative discoveries and innovative research strategies that will ultimately protect and improve human health for the United States’ 3.3 million people with epilepsy.",Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy,10355919,R56NS099348,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Archives ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Convulsions ', ' Grand Mal Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Seizure Disorder ', ' Major Epilepsy ', ' Major Motor Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic Clonic Convulsions ', ' Tonic Clonic Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Syndrome ', ' Tonic-Clonic Seizure Syndrome ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Information Theory ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Philosophy ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Seizures ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Resected ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' computer code ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Implant ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive tools ', ' side effect ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2021,551628,PA-03
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10178133,R01NS114020,"['Animals ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Cannabidiol ', ' Carbamazepine ', ' Epitol ', ' Tegretol ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clonazepam ', ' Clonus ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Head ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phenytoin ', ' Dilantin ', ' Diphenylhydantoin ', ' Fenitoin ', ' Pilocarpine ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Seizures ', ' Specificity ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Tail ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Valproic Acid ', ' Depakote ', ' Depakote ER ', ' Divalproex ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' kainate ', ' Body part ', ' Intuition ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Complex ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' user-friendly ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' selective expression ', ' selectively expressed ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' drug use screening ', ' optogenetics ', ' Drug Screening ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Treatment-related side effects ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,422740,CA-18
"Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life. Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures. Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre- seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold. Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control. The unpredictable nature of seizures is a burden on persons with epilepsy and their caregivers. Using animal models of absence epilepsy, we propose to test new methods for a) predicting when the next seizure will occur and b) using this information to prevent seizures from occurring.",Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures,10269920,R01NS117150,"['Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clozapine ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Oxides ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Specificity ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic Nuclei ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' calcium indicator ', ' Calcium ion ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Slice ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' efficacy testing ', ' optogenetics ', ' SCN8A gene ', ' NAV1.6 ', ' NaCh6 ', ' SCN8A ', ' sodium channel, voltage gated, type VIII, alpha subunit ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' in vivo two-photon imaging ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multiphoton microscopy ', ' multiphoton excitation microscopy ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,424577,CA-18
