"Leveraging Electronic Health Records and Genomic Biobanks for Kidney Stone Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Kidney stones are highly prevalent and recurrent. Our current understanding of kidney stone disease risk factors and disease associations has relied primarily on data from chart review, nonspecific administrative datasets, and secondary analyses of observation studies. Current study designs suffer from small sample sizes, heterogenous patient groups, and lack of standardized accuracy data and outcome definitions. The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) provides novel research opportunities for kidney stone disease. EHRs contain a robust clinical repository of data collected over time from clinical care. However, there are currently limited tools to identify and characterize kidney stone patients in the EHR. The objective of this study is to establish feasibility of utilizing EHR data to investigate kidney stone disease. To structure EHR data in an efficient and cost-effective manner, natural language processing and deep learning methods can be designed for identifying and phenotyping kidney stone patients and clinical outcomes. Our de-identified EHR is linked to a DNA biobank that can enable investigation of genetic associations with disease. This project has two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will perform genetic association studies in our EHR and linked DNA biobank. We will replicate previously described associations with genetic variants and kidney stone disease. We will then perform a genome-wide association study to discover novel associations. In Aim 2, our goal is to develop and validate a computable framework to extract clinical outcomes of kidney stone disease from the EHR. Clinically meaningful outcomes include symptomatic stone passage and radiographic stone characterization. We will develop and test natural language processing and deep learning algorithms to extract keywords and context-based information in clinical notes and reports. We will train and test these algorithms using manual annotation as the gold standard. This aim will enable rigorous phenotyping of each kidney stone patient using structured and unstructured EHR data. Successful completion of this project will lay the groundwork towards advancing genomic medicine and precision health to support clinical decision-making in kidney stone patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to establish the feasibility of kidney stone research using electronic health record data. Genetic association studies will be performed to replicate known and discover new variants with kidney stone disease. A computerized framework will be developed and validated to extract kidney stone patient outcomes.",Leveraging Electronic Health Records and Genomic Biobanks for Kidney Stone Disease,10103906,R21DK127075,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Kidney Calculi ', ' Kidney Stones ', ' Renal Calculi ', ' Renal Stone ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Mind ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Genetic study ', ' genomic tools ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' support tools ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' phenotypic data ', ' secondary analysis ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Precision Health ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' unstructured data ', ' clinical data repository ', ' ']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,259500,TN-05
"Predicting Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease in Sickle Cell Anemia Using Machine Learning Models (PREMIER) ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a vasculopathy affecting multiple end organs, with complications including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Albuminuria, an early measure of glomerular injury, is common in SCD and predicts progressive kidney disease. Kidney function decline is faster in SCD patients than in the general African American population. The prevalence of rapid decline in SCD is 3-fold higher than in the general population. Furthermore, high-risk APOL1 variants are associated with an increased risk of albuminuria and progression of CKD in SCD. Kidney disease, regardless of severity, and rapid eGFR decline are associated with increased mortality in SCD. As such, early identification of patients at risk for progression of CKD is important to address potentially modifiable risk factors, slow eGFR decline and reduce mortality. Despite the high prevalence of CKD and its contribution to increased morbidity and mortality, available treatments for SCD-related kidney disease remain limited. Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and hydroxyurea decrease albuminuria in short-term studies, their benefits in preventing or slowing progressive loss of kidney function in SCD remain undefined. We have recently reported that machine learning (ML) models can identify patients at high risk for rapid decline in kidney function. Further, higher hemoglobin concentration is also an independent predictor of decreased odds of rapid kidney function decline. With the contribution of intravascular hemolysis to the pathophysiology of SCD-related glomerulopathy, voxelotor, a small molecule which modifies sickle hemoglobin oxygen affinity and improves sickle RBC survival, may decrease glomerular injury and slow the progression of CKD in individuals with SCD. In this application, we propose the conduct of a prospective, multicenter study to build a ML-based predictive model for progression of CKD in adults with SCD. Furthermore, in individuals predicted to be at risk for rapid decline in kidney function, based on the presence of persistent albuminuria (urine ACR ≥ 100 mg/g), we will evaluate the effect of voxelotor on albuminuria, rapid decline in kidney function and progression of CKD. With advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and its complications, combined with an increasing number of approved drug therapies, early identification of patients at risk for progressive kidney disease and subsequent increased risk of death is necessary to modify known risk factors, initiate targeted therapies and possibly increase life expectancy. Further, with the known contribution of hemolytic anemia to the pathogenesis of SCD-related glomerulopathy and progressive kidney disease, drugs that decrease hemolysis are likely to be beneficial in preventing and/or slowing the progression of kidney disease in this patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by involvement of multiple end organs, resulting in multiple complications including chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD as well as rapid decline of kidney function are common in SCD, and are associated with increased risk of death. We propose studies to identify individuals at high risk for progression of CKD using machine learning models, and to evaluate the kidney-protective effects of voxelotor, a novel inhibitor of sickle hemoglobin polymerization, in individuals at risk for rapid decline in kidney function.",Predicting Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease in Sickle Cell Anemia Using Machine Learning Models (PREMIER),10280257,R01HL159376,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Hemolytic Anemia ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle disease ', ' sicklemia ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Sickle Hemoglobin ', ' Hemoglobin S ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hemolysis ', ' erythrolysis ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Pulmonary Hypertension ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle RBC ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' polymerization ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' sickling inhibitor ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' protective effect ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' renal damage ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2021,705287,TN-09
"Predicting post-transplant kidney function from pre-transplant biopsy and clinical biomarkers using a convolutional neural network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The need for transplantable kidneys far exceeds their availability with over 90,000 candidates currently waitlisted but less than 22,000 transplants performed annually. Over 8,000 patients are removed from the waitlist each year due to death or deterioration in health while awaiting an offer. Despite this critical need for organs, nearly 20% of recovered kidneys are ultimately discarded. The most commonly reported reason for discard is unfavorable histology on donor biopsy. These pre-transplant biopsies are performed in order to assess the quality of the organ and are often used as a tool to predict post-implantation allograft performance. Unfortunately, the prognostic significance of biopsy findings is controversial and there is growing concern regarding the reliability and reproducibility of data derived from biopsy interpretation due to inter-pathologist variability. Recent evidence demonstrates that recipient graft outcomes correlate only with donor biopsy interpretation performed by an experienced renal pathologist. However, most transplant centers have no more than a handful of dedicated expert renal pathologists; given that organ recovery often occurs at remote hospitals late at night or on weekends, biopsies are usually interpreted by on-call pathologists without dedicated training in renal histology. These providers tend to overestimate the severity of chronic lesions, resulting in the inappropriate discard of otherwise acceptable organs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a machine learning technique, can equal or exceed human performance in visual analysis tasks in an automated, objective fashion. We propose to leverage this new technology to accomplish the following aims: (1) To develop a CNN that reliably and accurately predicts post- transplant graft function from digitized procurement biopsy slides and donor and recipient metrics in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) dataset; (2) To compare the predictive accuracy of our CNN to currently available donor risk scores; and (3) To qualitatively evaluate CNN adoptability, acceptability, and utility by clinicians. These aims are highly feasible given our group's expertise in machine learning, kidney transplantation, and analysis of SRTR data. We hypothesize that we can build a CNN that provides transplant physicians with accurate pre-operative real- time estimates of post-transplant graft success to help guide patient counseling. If the proposed aims are achieved, feedback from our CNN could prevent the inappropriate discard of thousands of kidneys and decrease waitlist mortality by increasing the number of transplants performed across the country. By conducting this research, Dr. Eagleson will cultivate a skillset that includes national registry data analysis, qualitative methods, and machine learning: important modern techniques that are rapidly becoming used throughout medicine and will serve her well throughout her career as an independent surgeon-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thousands of potentially transplantable kidneys are discarded every year, often based on misleading and inconsistent biopsy reads that are inevitable because of the logistics of organ offers. To overcome the current limitations of histologic assessment, we aim to develop, validate, and qualitatively evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accurately and reliably predicts post-transplant recipient kidney function from clinical biomarkers and a digitized pre-transplant donor biopsy slide. In addition to providing a real-time preoperative estimate of graft success to help guide patient-physician decision-making, our CNN could prevent the inappropriate discard of thousands of transplantable kidneys and decrease waitlist mortality by increasing the number of transplants performed across the country.",Predicting post-transplant kidney function from pre-transplant biopsy and clinical biomarkers using a convolutional neural network,10315165,F32DK128977,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Learning ', ' Maryland ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Modernization ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Standardization ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' statistical process ', ' statistical reasoning ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Specialist ', ' levan ', ' polyfructose ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Visual ', ' Recovery ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Allografting ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' implantation ', ' transplant registry ', ' task analysis ', ' graft function ', ' clinical practice ', ' data registry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' adaptive learning ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' prognostic significance ', ' transplant centers ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' post-transplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,86458,MD-07
"Multiparametric mapping of Covid-19 immune responses in Kidney transplant recipients Abstract As of May 2020, over five million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally with over 400,000 associated deaths. Around 5-20% of patients develop critical illness, which predominantly manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome. When this develops, the estimated mortality is around 40%, and as high as 80% in ventilated patients. Several early reports describe the development of an excessive inflammatory response, the so-called `cytokine storm', which is strongly associated with rapid deterioration in clinical condition and mortality. Early reports of kidney transplant recipients, who are at high risk due to chronic immunosuppression and additional comorbid diseases, portray a concerning picture. In one series of 36 patients, 39% required mechanical ventilation, 21% required renal replacement therapy, and 28% died. Of the 11 patients that were intubated, 64% died. However, there is still an unmet need of understanding disease natural course, specific risk factors, identifying biomarkers, as well as potential impact of COVID-19 on graft/patient survival in vulnerable KTRs. To fill this information gap, we propose a comprehensive observational analysis of epidemiological factors and immunological assay results in COVID19-infected KTRs at 2 medical centers at the epicenter of COVID19 infection in NYC (Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx). We hypothesize that specific recipient clinical characteristics affect COVID-19 clinical course and that recipient immunosuppression in KTRs alters the ability of COVID-19 KTRs to develop protective anti-COVID-19 humoral and cell-mediated immunity that contributes to the morbidity and mortality of these individuals. We will test this hypothesis by 1) examining risk factors of COVID-19 severity in a large dataset of KTRs and individuals from the general population with COVID-19 (aim 1); 2) by characterizing the COVID-19 reactive humoral and cellular immune response in serially collected samples from COVID-19 KTRs (aim 2); and 3) by comprehensive assessment of DNA and serial serum, RNA, and PBMC from COVID-19 KTRs to identify disease mechanisms and potentially informative biomarkers for outcomes (aim 3). The proposed work is significant because of the high incidence of the disease, rate of community transmission, high mortality, and absence of clearly effective therapeutic options. Our studies will be amongst the first to define risk factors, predictors, and pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 in Kidney transplantation and may apply to recipients of other transplanted organs, as well as to individuals on chronic immunosuppression due to autoimmune diseases. Project Narrative: In this application we propose to study COVID-19 disease from SARS-CoV-2 virus in the unique risk population of Kidney transplant recipients. Using data and bio-samples from two hospital systems at the forefront of this pandemic and the highest COVID-19 case loads, we wil identify clinical and biomarker risk profiles for disease severity in transplant patients with COVID disease. In addition, we will use novel assays for humoral and cell-mediated immunity to study COVID immune responses in these immunosupppressed patients and compare with controls.",Multiparametric mapping of

"Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health) PROJECT SUMMARY  To expand the kidney-related biomedical workforce and counter the increasing disparity between the growing prevalence of renal disease and the disproportionate level of trainees, researchers and practitioners in nephrology and kidney health, we developed the Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health). ADVANCE Kidney Health is an education- based, hands-on research, education and clinical experience that applies pillars of 1) science, medical and engineering education; 2) training in innovation, entrepreneurialism and scientific translation; 3) experiential learning, mentorship and clinical immersion; and 4) needs-based application and practical translation – all aimed at producing motivated, trained and committed biomedical trainees interested in renal health and science to advance the workforce and develop the new health-related therapies of the future. The program recruits undergraduate students from across 15 departments within the College of Engineering at the University of Arizona (UArizona) that include: Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. ADVANCE Kidney Health is structured to provide trainees a medical school experience for early-stage undergraduate learners geared to instill an understanding of renal anatomy and kidney function. The core structure accesses a clinical experience to instill a motivation to pursue kidney- related patient care and/or translational research and progresses to an already established innovation bootcamp that culminates in an interdisciplinary capstone that has doubled in size over 10 years and accesses by more than 450 captive engineering students. The program leverages new infrastructure in medical and engineering education along with transdisciplinary programs aimed at innovation, technology development and entrepreneurialism with 15 physician navigators in kidney health and 23 engineering and scientific mentors spanning renal physiology, biomedical engineering, optical sciences and machine learning. The result is an interrelated program that bridges renal medicine, engineering and product development to develop new pipelines and on-ramps to impact career decisions and grow the future kidney-related workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevalence of end-stage renal failure (ESRD) has increased ~40% over 20 years, but the kidney-related biomedical workforce has been unable to keep pace. New pathways to a career in nephrology and kidney-related medicine and research are vitally needed that combine early and frequent experiential opportunities to engage in patient-oriented kidney care and contribute to innovative technologies that will one-day change how renal dysfunction is diagnosed and treated.

"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10264054,R01DK126815,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Adult

"Precision Mass Spec Imaging Based Structure-Function Signatures of Diabetic Glomerulopathy Project Summary/Abstract There are currently >450,000 patients on dialysis and ~120,000 patients will have to begin dialysis each year in the United States. Along with a marked reduction in quality of patient life, the cost to the US Medicare system is in excess of $114B per year. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing new platforms that will enhance the drug development process for new therapies to reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. Non-invasive biomarkers may be useful but do not directly identify the pathways linked to pathology in the kidney. An approach that integrates tissue structure with functional readouts in a kidney biopsy would be a major advance. We are developing a computational platform that leverages mass spec imaging data coupled with computational pathology for kidney tissue as a technology that will address this unmet need. With our computational platform we can identify signatures linked to normal and abnormal pathology on the same tissue section. This is a powerful approach to understand kidney pathology and will be of great value for drug development for kidney disease. Parameters related to reproducibility across pre-clinical models of diabetic kidney disease interpretation will be optimized during Phase I. Upon completion of the SBIR Phase I project we will have rigorous data to determine consistency of diseased glomerular signatures in diabetic nephropathy. This proof of concept data will make it attractive to pharma and biotech to adopt this platform for application for their therapeutic programs for diabetic kidney disease. Project Narrative Existing technologies only identify altered structures in kidney biopsies without providing insight into why the pathology is there and progressing. With the new computational platform incorporating mass spec imaging data coupled to computational pathology developed at SygnaMap we can localize functional alterations of diseased structures in a biopsy.

"Computational Pathology of Proteinuric Diseases Project Summary/Abstract: Computational Pathology for Proteinuric Glomerulopathies The presently employed morphology-based classification system of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD) does not adequately capture the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of these diseases and impairs the ability of clinicians to precisely define a patient’s disease, or predict outcome or effective intervention. The goal of this research is to advance the work of the glomerular disease research community by identifying biologically-relevant surrogates and subclasses of FSGS/MCD using computational pathology and machine learning methods. Prospective, longitudinal, multi-dimensional data sets that include digital kidney biopsies and molecular and clinical information can be analyzed by advanced “computer vision” methods and machine learning analytical approaches. This project will employ these rich resources and methods, which offer an unprecedented opportunity to leverage information derived from kidney tissue to improve the diagnosis, outcome prediction, and identification of glomerular disease mechanisms. The interdisciplinary team assembled to conduct this study has vast experience and a long-standing history of collaboration. In our preliminary studies we have demonstrated that (i) structural changes associate with outcomes and molecular mechanisms and improve clinical outcome prediction beyond current clinical approaches, and that (ii) computer vision technology can be used to accurately and efficiently detect normal and abnormal kidney structures and quantify textural (i.e., the spatial relationship between pixel values) and morphological (i.e., shape, size) information from kidney tissue. We will test our central hypothesis that inherent in the complexity of the structural changes in the renal parenchyma is information predictive of underlying disease biology and clinical outcome. We will pursue this hypothesis (1) by testing the clinical and molecular relevance of automatic detection and quantification of known morphologic biomarkers of clinical outcomes and mechanisms and of groups of patients with similar DL-derived morphologic characteristics; (2) by extracting next-generation pathomic features from DL-derived morphologic parameters and by testing their associations—individually and combined into pathomic profiles—with clinical outcomes and gene expression; and (3) by building machine learning-based models that integrate computer vision-derived pathology data with gene expression and clinical data to predict individual patient clinical outcomes, and to assess the additive prediction value of each data domain. Finally, we will group patients using the biomarkers identified to be most predictive of clinical outcomes. Ultimately, our work will contribute to a foundation for the deployment of a comprehensive artificial intelligence-guided precision medicine program for FSGS/MCD, applying descriptive, predictive, and ultimately prescriptive analytics as support tools for practicing pathologists and nephrologists. Project Narrative The computer vision technologies and machine learning methods applied in this grant will facilitate a precision medicine approach for nephrotic syndrome patients through automated histologic assessment of renal biopsies and comprehensive characterization of kidney structure, function, and molecular endophenotypes.

"Using Machine Learning for Early Recognition and Personalized Treatment of Acute Kidney Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in up to 20% of hospitalized patients and is associated with increased risk of readmission, morbidity, and mortality. The estimated annual cost of AKI care in the US is over 10 billion dollars, and, with the incidence rising, these costs will continue to increase. The current gold standards for diagnosing AKI, creatinine and urine output, are often delayed in their recognition of tubular injury. Prior work on AKI has typically focused on patients who have already developed AKI based on these standards, and interventions at this late time point have had mixed success. In contrast, emerging data suggest that intervening earlier can improve outcomes. Therefore, it is critical to optimize the early detection of AKI in hospitalized patients.  We have previously developed a machine learning tool to identify patients at high risk of severe (stage 2 or greater) AKI more than a day earlier than clinically apparent using structured electronic health record (EHR) data. Although more accurate than prior methods, it suffers from a high rate of false positives, which limits its value in clinical practice. There is a large amount of valuable information that is stored in unstructured free-text fields (e.g., clinical notes) that could be utilized using natural language processing (NLP) within advanced deep learning neural network models that could significantly improve the detection of early AKI. Furthermore, there are established and emerging kidney injury biomarkers that could be combined with EHR-based models to improve accuracy even further. Finally, it remains unclear what interventions will have the best chance of decreasing the risk for developing severe AKI in high-risk patients. A better understanding of which interventions are of greatest benefit to specific patients is critical for improving the outcomes of patients at risk of AKI.  The objective of this project is to develop novel tools to improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk of AKI using a large, multicenter cohort. In Aim 1, we will use NLP and deep learning algorithms to develop a model to predict severe AKI across four health systems. In Aim 2, we will silently run the best- performing model developed in Aim 1 in real-time to identify high-risk patients. Manual retrospective chart review will be performed on a cohort of the highest risk patients to determine both the proportion of patients who receive guideline-based care as well as the association between receipt of guideline-based care and outcomes. We will also identify novel phenotypes of patients who are particularly helped or harmed by specific guideline-based interventions. Finally, in Aim 3, we will collect kidney injury biomarkers in the highest-risk patients to determine the added value of biomarkers to EHR-based models alone. Our proposal will provide clinicians with new tools to identify patients at risk of AKI earlier and more accurately. It will also provide evidence for which interventions are most likely to improve patient outcomes. This will result in earlier, more personalized care for patients at high risk of AKI, which will lead to decreased costs, morbidity, and mortality.

"Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization Project Summary: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization A recent White House initiative titled Advancing American Kidney Health outlines the current administration's plans to increase the supply of kidneys in the US, along with other measures that attempt to correct the imbalance between supply and demand for kidneys. In alignment with this White House initiative, the principal investigator (PI) of this project will develop algorithms to assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) make donor disposition decisions with the goal of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. The PI will harness the vast amount of data collected by OPOs, and customize as well as develop new Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify good donors. These algorithms will reduce case coordinators workload and improve the accuracy of their decisions. The PI's objective is to quantity the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on increasing the supply of kidneys by ﬁnding missed opportunities on account of the current manual processes. Even a few more potential donors per OPO will help reduce the organ shortage problem when scaled to all 58 OPOs across the country.  This project will leverage unique data sets to generate and test hypotheses concerning which fac- tors aﬀect donor disposition decisions, and which information processing protocols produce greater referral-to-donor conversion rate. It will also customize classiﬁcation algorithms to assist case co- ordinators make donor disposition decisions. The focus will be on improving both the accuracy and speed of such decisions. As a follow up of this project, the PI will conduct a broader study involving at least ﬁve additional OPOs. The ﬁve OPOs will be selected to represent the diversity in size, population, and geography among the 58 OPOs across the country. Results of this and the follow-up study will be shared freely with all OPOs. The proposed research has the potential to increase the number of donors, free up staﬀ time, and lower OPO labor costs.  The potential impact of this project lies in the formulation and testing of hypotheses that can beneﬁt OPO decision-making and people on transplant wait list, customization of existing machine learning algorithms and computational techniques for sequential decision-making in a novel setting, and laying the groundwork for the development of new methods in the future.  The PI has the necessary disciplinary expertise, and management and leadership experience to succeed in the proposed eﬀorts. He has access to advanced computing resources and administrative help from the University of Texas. Finally, he has obtained the necessary IRB approval to proceed with this project. 1 Project Narrative: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization The widespread use of electronic medical record systems by hospitals, and electronic capture of referrals data by the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) makes it possible to harness large amounts of data to augment human decision-making and ask whether this can increase the supply of organs, speciﬁcally kidneys. The PI in this project will focus on improving the speed and accuracy of case coordinators' donor-disposition decisions by developing and testing customized machine learning and sequential decision-making algorithms using data from two OPOs. These eﬀorts will help quantify the potential beneﬁt of leveraging OPO data to increase kidney supply and pave the way for a larger study focusing on multiple OPOs.",Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization,10246800,R03HS027671,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2021,58019,TX-10
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,10261451,R33MH118170,"['Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Axon ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Concussion ', ' Cerebral Concussion ', ' Commotio Cerebri ', ' concussion ', ' Calibration ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Color ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Production ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Probes ', ' RNA Gene Probes ', ' Seizures ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Stream ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' innovative technologies ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' drug efficacy ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Devices ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"Development of a Precision Medicine-based Diagnostic Tool for Membranous Nephropathy Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a precision medicine approach to the rapid diagnosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) using automated statistical analysis of proteomic data obtained from kidney biopsies. This approach uses data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) and an algorithmic data pipeline capable of efficiently determining the most likely MN antigen types present in kidney biopsy tissue. MN is a heterogenous autoimmune kidney disease that is caused in most cases by the presence of circulating pathogenic autoantibodies that react with podocyte antigens leading to the formation and accumulation of pathogenic immune complexes around glomerular capillary loops. Using the example of PLA2R-type MN, determination of antigen type has been shown to be important for diagnosis, monitoring response to treatment and early detection of disease flares. Historically, determination of MN antigen type has been performed by immunostaining; however, this has become impractical due to the discovery of at least 17 antigen types. There often is not enough tissue in the biopsy sample to conduct this number of immunostains, and moreover the immunostaining process is both time and resource intensive. The use of DIA-MS provides a novel proteomics approach to antigen typing in which immune complexes are captured by elution from frozen biopsy tissue, digested into tryptic peptides, and then measured by DIA-MS. Candidate MN antigens are identified using algorithmic classification and then validated in a final immunostaining step to confirm the candidate antigen. Our preliminary studies indicate that this is a robust approach; however, the method is not scalable without a similarly robust data analysis pipeline. In this Phase I project, we will optimize the DIA-MS method and then collect quantitative data from known cases of the most common types of MN that can be used to develop, train, test and optimize algorithmic classification models using a machine learning (ML) approach. In order to train the ML models, we will collect DIA-MS protein abundance data from 50 samples each of PLA2R, THSD7A and Exostosin types of MN, as well as 50 samples that are negative for each of these antigens as controls. In the Phase II, we will build complete datasets for all known antigen types of MN and optimize the ML classifier model for diagnostic workflows. Successful completion of these aims will result in the development a comprehensive method to efficiently classify MN cases of any antigen type. These tools will advance the practice of renal pathology from a largely morphology-based approach of diagnosing disease to a precision medicine-based proteomics approach that will efficiently provide actionable information to clinicians caring for patients with MN. PROJECT NARRATIVE Membranous nephropathy is a heterogenous autoimmune kidney disease that is caused in most cases by the presence of circulating pathogenic autoantibodies that react with antigens in podocytes or circulating autoantigens, leading to the formation and accumulation of pathogenic immune complex deposits around glomerular capillary loops. New findings suggest that these pathogenic autoantibodies are formed in each case by an autoimmune response against a single autoantigen, and that the titer of autoantibodies can serve as a useful biomarker for activity of disease that can in turn be used to monitor disease status and guide therapy. In this Phase I application, we will develop analytical methods using Data Independent Mass Spectrometry (DIA- MS) and machine learning that will ultimately enable efficient identification of autoantigen types in kidney biopsies from patients with membranous nephropathy of any type.",Development of a Precision Medicine-based Diagnostic Tool for Membranous Nephropathy,10324016,R41DK130702,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigen-Antibody Complex ', ' Immune Complex ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Archives ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Autoantigens ', ' Autologous Antigens ', ' Self-Antigens ', ' Autoimmune Responses ', ' Biopsy ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Explosion ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Membranous Glomerulonephritis ', ' Extramembranous Glomerulopathy ', ' Membranous Glomerulonephropathy ', ' Membranous Glomerulopathy ', ' Membranous Nephropathy ', ' Goals ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Lupus Nephritis ', ' Lupus Glomerulonephritis ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephritis ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Publishing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Extracts ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' G-substrate ', ' cerebellum protein substrate for cGMP dependent protein kinase ', ' protein G ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Glomerular Capillary ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' podocyte ', ' Incubated ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Flare ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data acquisition ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' classification algorithm ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' data pipeline ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' learning classifier ', ' feature selection ', ' Autoimmune ', ' pathogenic autoantibodies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEPHROPATHOLOGY ASSOCIATES,R41,2021,247778,AR-02
"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A

"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking. We will conduct simulation modeling to identify a unique set of risk factors that predict CKD and CKD progression, that can be targeted for individualized treatment in patients with highest risk of kidney function decline, with valuable input on the potential utility of this resource from focus groups consisting of primary care physicians.",Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation

"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing.

"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute Disease ', ' acute disease/disorder ', ' acute disorder ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' prognostic tool ', ' inter-institutional ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' translational scientist ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational researcher ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' acute care ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' computable phenotypes ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110,FL-03
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,10170765,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Award ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Calculi ', ' Kidney Stones ', ' Renal Calculi ', ' Renal Stone ', ' Learning ', ' Metals ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Needles ', ' Noise ', ' North America ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Nonionizing Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Radiation ', ' Nonionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Non-Ionizing Total ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Interventional Ultrasonography ', ' Interventional Ultrasound ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Structure ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' image guided intervention ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Network-based ', ' Geometry ', ' signal processing ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' Breast biopsy ', ' metallicity ', ' imaging scientist ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Visualization ', ' algorithm training ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,235027,MD-07
"(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long- term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’ performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention. In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it. However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes. Project Narrative Patients at high risk for acute kidney injury are often identified late and often do not receive recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, with drugs being the most common cause; yet are potentially preventable. Clinical decision support to physicians in the form of automated alerts and pharmacist guidance for high-risk patients with drug-associated acute kidney injury (D-AKI) could dramatically improve risk assessment, medication use, and drug dosing in even non-drug-associated acute kidney injury. In this randomized control trial application, we will test whether adult hospitalized patients with D-AKI, cared for by physicians randomized to receive clinical decision support with an advanced pharmacist-led intervention, will have a lower risk for dialysis and premature death.",(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI,10209005,R01DK121730,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Series ', ' Recovery ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' Hospitalists ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' clinical risk ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' imaging agent ', ' equipment training ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' renal damage ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' implementation intervention ', ' implementation cost ', ' implementation investment ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,562198,PA-18
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE.

"Targeting the B Cell Response to Treat Antibody-Mediated Rejection ABSTRACT Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of solid organ transplants is the leading cause of immunologic graft injury, shortening the half-life of transplants and consequently of transplant recipients. This immunologically mediated process depends on B lymphocyte activation with differentiation to plasma cells (PC) that produce antibodies to the donor organ. Once established, antibodies have proven difficult to eradicate. Establishing an effective and safe way to treat patients with established AMR would potentially increase the half-life of transplanted organs, extend the lives of patients, and reduce the need for re-transplantation, ultimately increasing the number of patients who could receive life-saving organ transplants. Our lab has described an effective therapy in a non- human primate (NHP) sensitized model of kidney transplantation for lowering donor-specific antibody (DSA) and preventing injury from AMR. The treatment depends on PC depletion in combination with germinal center disorganization which together lower alloantibody levels. Dual targeting of the immune system by complementary drugs is based on NHP and human data using a proteasome inhibitor and belatacept. B cell activation and differentiation is inhibited at the same time that PC are depleted. Consequently, DSA declines, inflammation in the kidney resolves, and renal function stabilizes. The impact of this intervention on infection risk is not well defined but is anticipated to increase. We propose to measure the impact of therapy on both HLA-specific and pathogen-specific B memory cells and PC. We hypothesize that there is a hierarchy of susceptibility to therapy, with protective immunity being more resistant than allogeneic B cell memory. We will evaluate the impact of the regimen on T-cell function focusing on cytomegalovirus (CMV). Current therapy of late AMR using therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) with or without rituximab has shown variable results and frequent rebound of DSA. A low level of evidence supports the efficacy of these treatments, implying a tremendous need for well-conducted clinical trials to guide treatment of AMR. We propose a Phase I/II randomized, controlled, prospective interventional study of AMR in human kidney transplant patients using combined carfilzomib/belatacept (C/B) therapy with TPE and IVIG compared to TPE/IVIG alone. Outcomes will include the clinical impact of therapy on AMR using the recently validated iBox score for AMR assessment and the number and type of infections using standardized definitions of infection. We will measure the impact of therapy on HLA and pathogen-associated B memory and PC as well as CMV-specific polyfunctional T-cells. We will assess computational digital imaging analysis of AMR non-visual biopsy features to assess whether machine learning algorithms can improve on Banff criteria of AMR to better guide treatment and predict clinical outcome. Since late active and chronic active AMR have such a poor prognosis for kidney transplant patients, we believe that this trial is ethically justified and would potentially yield important safety and preliminary efficacy data that may lead to improved immune management of transplant patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE / PROJECT NARRATIVE End stage renal failure represents a massive health care problem for the United States, affecting 650,000 Americans every year, and having a mortality associated with dialysis of 65% within 5 years. $42 billion is spent annually for hemodialysis. Kidney transplantation dramatically reduces the cost of caring for such patients and improves their lifespan.

"Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are guideline- recommended therapies for preventing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients with CKD. However, in real-world practice, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued by providers in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), rapid declines in kidney function, or advanced CKD. Premature discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs can lead to adverse clinical outcomes among patients with CKD. However, discontinuation of these agents may be appropriate for certain CKD subgroups who are at higher risk of AKI and who may derive less benefit from these agents than trial populations. Although guidelines support the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with CKD, they also allow for individualization of decisions surrounding their use. However, it is unclear how to best individualize these decisions as CKD progresses to optimize kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to personalize ACEI/ARB therapy for patients with CKD based on each individual's risk factors for ESKD and CVD. To accomplish this, we will use data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. We will first identify factors that drive the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs (Aim 1). Next, we will build two clinical tools that model the relationship between ACEI/ARB discontinuation and risk of ESKD (Aim 2) or CVD events (Aim 3) in individuals with CKD. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of kidney disease and improve patient outcomes by individualizing medication use in CKD. We expect that completion of these aims will result in the development of two prediction tools that can be further refined and implemented in real-world clinical practice as part of a career development award application. The proposed aims are integrated into a comprehensive training plan that includes a Master's Degree in Clinical Research and practical mentored experiences. Through this training plan, Dr. Chen will have the opportunity to 1) learn and apply knowledge in advanced biostatistical and epidemiological methods, including marginal structural modeling; 2) gain familiarity with the CRIC Study database, 3) apply machine learning algorithms to the development of clinical prediction tools, 4) refine skills in scientific writing and presenting research, and 5) advance towards a career development award and independence as a clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to prevent adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on a population level. However, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued despite guidelines recommending their use as first-line anti-hypertensive agents in CKD. This proposal aims to develop clinical tools that will predict whether individuals are likely to benefit versus be harmed by discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs, with the goal of improving the safe and

"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,10221053,R01LM013311,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Heart ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Survival ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Tissue Transplantation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Space Models ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Techniques ', ' hazard ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' cost ', ' immunogenicity ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' graft failure ', ' learning network ', ' discrete time ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' survival prediction ', ' predict survival ', ' predictor of survival ', ' high dimensionality ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' transplant model ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2021,277764,OH-09
"Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, LDs take on a higher risk of future ESKD themselves. African American (AA) LDs have an even greater, 3.3-fold, risk of ESKD than white LDs post-donation. Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counseling about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of ESRD post-donation, and AAs’ widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates’ safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.  No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally competent manner. Clinical “chatbots,” mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to provide genetic information to patients and relieve constraints on clinicians’ time, can improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict. The chatbot “Gia,” created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no chatbot on APOL1 is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for nephrologists to counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner. Given the shortage of genetic counselors, increasing nephrologists’ genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.  The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an APOL1 testing program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the culturally competent testing, chatbot, and counseling on AA LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate, and satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to: 1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness, and willingness to  donate in a pre-post design 3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the RE-AIM framework to  longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs’ satisfaction with informed consent.  The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which can then be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve patient informed consent. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants may contribute to African American living kidney donors’ even greater (3.3-fold) risk of end-stage renal disease post-donation than white living kidney donors. However, transplant physicians do not consistently use APOL1 genetic testing or counsel African American living donor candidates about APOL1, which may undermine candidates’ ability to give informed consent about donating and exacerbate health disparities in living donation and transplantation. By evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program, the proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly scale up APOL1 testing nationally as a novel and ethical approach to protect African American living donors’ safety and enhance their informed consent.",Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation,10180256,R01DK128207,"['Adoption ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Altruism ', ' altruistic ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Counseling ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' literacy ', ' Medicine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' African ', ' satisfaction ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' culturally competent ', ' cultural competence ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' genetic information ', ' genetic counselor ', ' transplant centers ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance ', ' RE-AIM ', ' reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance ', ' implementation intervention ', ' implementation outcomes ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,714612,IL-07
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and

"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,10179372,R01DK124388,"['Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Weight ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' mortality ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Nephrology ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' United States ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Malnutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Muscle function ', ' Individual ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dietitian ', ' Kilogram ', ' Techniques ', ' meter ', ' muscle strength ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' obesity management ', ' health related quality of life ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Non obese ', ' Nonobese ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' morphogens ', ' differentiation factors ', ' morphogenic factors ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' improved mobility ', ' mobility enhancement ', ' mobility improvement ', ' optimized mobility ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' data registry ', ' healthy weight ', ' clinical predictors ', ' reduced muscle strength ', ' decreased muscle strength ', ' dynapenia ', ' low muscle strength ', ' muscle strength decline ', ' predictive tools ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' stakeholder perspectives ', ' stakeholder insights ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,291877,PA-03
"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement). These advances offer long-term potential for the development of new therapies that will ultimately improve clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes.",Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease,10153779,R01DK123459,"['Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetic Nephropathy ', ' Diabetic Kidney Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue repository ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor ', ' Cachectin Receptors ', ' TNF Receptor Family Protein ', ' TNF Receptor Superfamily ', ' TNF Receptors ', ' TNFR ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Family ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' diabetic ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Tubular ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' aptamer ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Proteome ', ' drug development ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' kidney development ', ' nephrogenesis ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' complement pathway ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' CCL2 ', ' Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 2 ', ' MCAF ', ' MCP-1 ', ' MCP1 ', ' Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 ', ' Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 ', ' Monocyte Chemotactic and Activating Factor ', ' Monocyte Chemotactic and Activating Protein ', ' Monocyte Chemotactive and Activating Factor ', ' Monocyte Secretory Protein JE ', ' SCYA2 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A2 ', ' CCL2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' stem ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' primary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' complement system ', ' study population ', ' random forest ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER,R01,2021,478789,MA-07
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,10153763,K08DK115891,"['Affect ', ' Award ', '

"Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application by an early stage investigator who has the long-term objective of studying determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease. Risk variants in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene on chromosome 22 are common in persons of African ancestry (African Americans and Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) and are one of the most powerful disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and effect size. This is an important discovery for kidney disease and has furthered our understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. There are efforts underway to incorporate APOL1 genetic testing in clinical settings including in pre-transplant evaluation and targeted therapies are on the horizon. However, the presence of two risk variants (i.e. the APOL1 high-risk genotypes, seen in up to 14% of African Americans and 4% of Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) does not lead to overt kidney disease in all individuals. This incomplete penetrance indicates a major role of either genetic or environmental modifiers i.e. ‘second hits’. Although some genetic modifiers have been discovered, previous studies have been hampered by lack of sample sizes due to underrepresentation of minorities. There are also strong associations between air pollution, adverse neighborhood environment (including walkability and poverty) and podocyte toxic heavy metals (Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury) with kidney disease and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately exposed to these environmental risk factors. We propose a robust research strategy leveraging several large datasets/cohorts to comprehensively investigate the genetic and environmental ‘second-hits’ for the APOL1- kidney disease association through the following Specific Aims: : To identify and replicate SNPs that modify the association of the APOL1 high-risk genotypes with kidney disease (Aim 1). Using genetic and clinical data on ~70,000 minority individuals (~5,400 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes), we will investigate SNPs modifying the association between APOL1 high-risk genotype and kidney disease. We will then perform replication of the top performing hits in ~25,000 independent individuals (~5,000 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). We will then assess the interaction of air pollution (particulate matter<2.5 µg or PM2.5) and adverse measures of neighborhood walkability/poverty with APOL1 high-risk for kidney disease (Aim 2) using geographically diverse studies: BioMe Biobank; Jackson Heart Study and REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) in ~40,000 individuals (~3,600 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). Finally, we will explore the interaction between urine levels of Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury with APOL1 high-risk genotypes for kidney disease in a case-control study from REGARDS (n=2,332) and in exploratory analyses assess whether soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels-an inflammatory APOL1 modifier-affects this interaction (Aim 3). This proposal will lead to critical insights on genetic and environmental ‘second hits’ for APOL1 and improved understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Mutations in a specific gene (Apolipoprotein L1 or APOL1) seen only in people of African ancestry (African Americans or Hispanic Americans) is linked to high rates of kidney disease, with only some of the individuals with these mutations developing kidney disease, indicating that other genetic or environmental factors are involved. We will explore these factors including other genes and common environmental exposures like air pollution/neighborhood environment, and heavy metal exposure. We will understand what additional risk factors contribute to kidney disease in individuals with this mutation, which will lead to preventative efforts to address the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease.",Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes,10100412,R01DK127139,"['Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', '

"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury. This proposal is designed to develop the resources needed to study human kidney injury and thus inform better clinical trials of treatments to both prevent kidney injury and improve recovery.",Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney,10145569,R21AG067335,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Atlases ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' autophagy ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Crystallization ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endothelium ', ' eosinophil ', ' Blood Eosinophil ', ' Eosinophilic Granulocyte ', ' Eosinophilic Leukocyte ', ' Marrow Eosinophil ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ions ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' male ', ' mast cell ', ' Marrow Mast Cell ', ' Tissue Basophils ', ' mastocyte ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Metals ', ' Morbidity -

"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10200790,R01DK116986,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Creatinine ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Suggestion ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' Informatics ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' novel ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Myocardial ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' case-based ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' clinical risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individual patient ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' feature selection ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,506211,KS-03
"Puberty, diabetes, and the kidneys, when eustress becomes distress PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common and serious complication in youth with 2 diabetes (T2D). Epidemiological data implicate puberty as a major accelerator of kidney injury in youth with obesity and diabetes, yet the mechanisms by which reproductive maturation results in kidney disease remain unknown. A better understanding of the pubertal mechanisms contributing to kidney disease is needed to promote preservation of native kidney function, especially in high-risk youth with obesity and/or T2D. We hypothesize that youth with obesity and/or T2D experience relative kidney hypoxia during puberty due to a metabolic mismatch between increased renal energy expenditure and impaired substrate metabolism. In turn, the kidney hypoxia results in loss of glomerular charge and size selectivity with increased transglomerular transport of protein, and kidney dysfunction. To address these hypotheses, we propose to design an accelerated longitudinal study in which we will enroll adolescents (8-14 years, 50% girls) with obesity and elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ≥6%) [n=60], and healthy normal weight controls [n=40] at Tanner (pubertal) stages 1-4 and examine them at baseline, 1 and 2-year follow-up. We will combine state-of- the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for quantifying kidney growth, oxygen availability and hemodynamic function with gold-standard measurements of glomerular filtration rate (iohexol clearance), renal plasma flow (p-aminohippurate clearance), glomerular size and charge selectivity (dextran and IgG/IgG4 clearance) and assessments of insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function (intravenous glucose tolerance test and metabolomics). These experiments are designed to define the mechanisms contributing to kidney injury during puberty and identify novel risk factors and therapeutic targets to mitigate the development of obesity and diabetes-related nephropathy. Project Narrative: Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) typically manifests during or shortly after puberty and is characterized by a greater frequency and severity of diabetic kidney disease compared to adult-onset T2D and type 1 diabetes of similar duration. Puberty is recognized to accelerate kidney injury in youth with obesity and diabetes and may explain the magnified risk of diabetic kidney disease in youth-onset T2D, yet the pubertal mechanisms contributing to kidney injury in obesity and youth-onset T2D are unknown. The accelerated longitudinal study proposed in this application seeks to address these substantive gaps in knowledge.","Puberty, diabetes, and the kidneys, when eustress becomes

"Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes Abstract Ciliopathies are a collection of debilitating developmental disorders (e.g. Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, polycystic kidney disease) which have no cures and limited but expensive treatments. Diagnosis and treatment is complicated due to ciliopathies causing multisystem pathologies and having large variance in their clinical presentations potentially resulting in neural tube defects, orofacial clefting, obesity, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration and in some cases, infant death. All ciliopathies are caused by dysfunctional cilia, the microtubule based organelle critical for cell-to-cell signaling, but currently there is limited understanding of the underlying molecular network responsible for proper cilia function. Recently, large-scale proteomic techniques have advanced where it is now possible to query the cell's molecular network and identify many new protein complexes. This proposal describes a research program that will 1) construct a ciliary complex map using proteomic techniques, 2) functionally characterize newly discovered ciliary complexes and 3) identify disruptions in complex assembly due to known ciliopathy mutations. Additional products of the proposed research will include a compendium of proteomic data on ciliated cells, statistical analysis tools for the discovery of protein complexes, functional characterization of critical ciliary processes and a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular network of ciliopathy disease states. This work aims to provide an important perspective of cilia biology in order to better understand the complex etiology and molecular causes of ciliopathies and potentially open new therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Ciliopathies are a class of debilitating birth defects without known cures and limited but expensive treatments. Currently, we lack understanding of the underlying molecular network in ciliopathy patient cells and know even less about the causes of clinical presentations in ciliopathy patients. I propose to discover the differences in the molecular network between healthy cells and ciliopathy patient cells in an effort to better understand the molecular causes of clinical presentations possibly open new avenues for therapeutics.""""""",Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes,10291010,R00HD092613,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Biology ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cilia ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fractionation ', ' Chemical Fractionation ', ' FRACN ', ' Fractionation Radiotherapy ', ' Future ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ion Exchange ', ' Polycystic Kidney Diseases ', ' Polycystic Kidney ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neural Tube Defects ', ' Neural Tube Developmental Defects ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Organelles ', ' Orofaciodigital Syndromes ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Rana ', ' Frog ', ' Research ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sea Anemones ', ' Actiniaria ', ' Sea Urchins ', ' Echinoidea ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Xenopus laevis ', ' Platanna ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' programs ', ' Joubert-Boltshauser syndrome ', ' cerebellar vermis agenesis ', ' cerebelloparenchymal disorder IV ', ' Joubert syndrome ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant demise ', ' infantile death ', ' infant death ', ' particle ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Bardet Biedel syndrome ', ' Bardet-Biedl Syndrome ', ' Regulation ', ' Property ', ' Proteomics ', ' Transgenesis ', ' Gene Transfer Techniques ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' Size Exclusion Chromatography ', ' Molecular Sieve Chromatography ', ' protein complex ', ' Ciliary Process ', ' Structure of ciliary processes ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Cell Biology ', ' in vivo ', ' Cilium Microtubule ', ' Collection ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' loss of function ', ' ciliopathy ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' college atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' education atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' school atmosphere ', ' school climate ', ' training atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' Meckel-Gruber syndrome ', ' Meckel syndrome ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R00,2021,249000,IL-07
"Renal MRI Biomarkers: The Route to Clinical Adoption Project Summary/ Abstract Functional renal MRI biomarkers are underused in research and clinical practice due to the need for dedicated in-house expertise and development. Transferring solutions to other centers is therefore a challenge, leading to a significant duplication of efforts, a lack of standardization in the methods, and difficulties in comparing results between centers. This also limits commercial buy-in, hinders the establishment of multi-center trials, and overall impedes the translation of these biomarkers into clinical practice. Our proposed workshop (https://www.ismrm.org/workshops/2021/Renal/) aims to bridge this gap. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together internationally recognized scientists and clinicians with new investigators who are currently developing and applying advanced renal MRI techniques in order to investigate the causes and consequences of kidney disease. The program of this workshop integrates clinical presentations outlining the needs for non-invasive testing and biomarkers with presentations on recent advances in contrast-based MRI, new applications of relaxometry, diffusion, and elastography, multinuclear applications, pre-clinical animal studies, and application of artificial intelligence techniques. With an important focus on the next generation, the workshop will include mentoring sessions for trainees and new investigators, called “Meet the Experts.” These mentoring sessions will provide specific information on clinical trials design, funding and regulations, as well as a hands-on “how I do it” sessions on available imaging post-processing software. This workshop is designed for researchers (including Ph.D. students and postdocs); clinicians (e.g., radiologists, nephrologists, renal transplant surgeons); MR technologists; government regulatory experts; nonprofit and academic groups interested in early diagnosis of renal disease; as well as members of the ISMRM, ASN, and PARENCHIMA. The program is designed for both senior investigators and junior scientists, with relevant topics for our attendees interested in continuing medical education. It presents knowledge of new methodologies in using quantitative MRI to diagnose and monitor a range of medical conditions, e.g., renal tissue injury, oxygenation, contrast and non-contrast perfusion, renal pre-transplant and post- transplant evaluations, etc. We will provide methods for utilizing this knowledge in clinical trials and practice, as well as guidance on data analysis. A key element of our plan is to reach out to women and minorities to encourage them to attend and participate in our workshop. This workshop will be a first in North America but follows three previous European meetings co-organized by the UK Renal Imaging Network (UKRIN) and the COST action “MRI Biomarkers for Chronic Kidney Disease” (PARENCHIMA). (https://renalmri.org). These previous workshops were attended by over 150 participants and presenters. Thus, we expect robust interest in the community for the proposed workshop.

"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",10192507,P01DK043881,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Calibration ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Lithotripsy ', ' Litholapaxy ', ' Methodology ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Ramp ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Urinary Calculi ', ' Urinary Stones ', ' Urinary Tract Stones ', ' Urolith ', ' Urologic Diseases ', ' Urinary Tract Diseases ', ' Urologic Disorder ', ' Urological Diseases ', ' Urological Disorders ', ' urinary tract disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' calcification ', ' Calcified ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', "" Bowman's space "", ' Urinary Space ', ' Painless ', ' non-painful ', ' nonpainful ', ' not painful ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' re-treatment ', ' Retreatment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' patient safety ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Ultrasonic ', ' Ultrasonics ', ' Biostatistics Core ', ' Detection ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' P01 Program ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Renal Tissue ', ' in vivo ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' safety study ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' biomechanical model ', ' biomechanic modeling ', ' biomechanic simulation ', ' biomechanical modeling ', ' biomechanical simulation ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Wait Time ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' complex data ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2021,1563076,WA-07
"AI driven acute renal replacement therapy - (AID-ART) Abstract Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in one-third of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and treated with kidney replacement therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU). Occurrence of IDH is associated with increased resource utilization such as fluid and vasopressor administration, discontinuation of kidney replacement therapy, decreased recovery of kidney function, dependence on kidney replacement therapy and death. IDH is often unrecognized until it is well established, by which time patients are refractory to treatment or have already developed organ injury. Thus, if one could accurately predict who and when patients develop IDH, then effective preemptive treatments could be administered to reduce risk of IDH and improve outcomes. Our preliminary work showed that advanced high-frequency data modeling and waveform analysis identified patients at risk for hypotension within 2 minutes of monitoring in the ICU, and if monitored for 5 minutes, differentiated between patients who would develop hypotension or remain stable over the next 48 hours. In this proposal entitled “Artificial Intelligence Driven Acute Renal Replacement Therapy (AID-ART)”, we propose to apply predictive analytics using linked electronic health record and high-frequency monitor data to critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and undergoing intermittent and continuous kidney replacement therapies at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic ICUs. We will examine the accuracy of various machine learning models to predict IDH risk-evaluating model performance, usability, alert frequency, lead time and number needed to alert, and hospital mortality and dependence on kidney replacement therapy (Aim 1a); predict response to a range of clinical interventions for IDH and subsequent clinical outcomes (Aim 1b); and perform cross validation across the two healthcare systems (Aim 1c). We will construct reinforcement learning systems to develop a rule-driven intervention for IDH alerts and measurement-driven responses to avoid and respond to IDH based on principles of functional hemodynamic monitoring (Aim 2a). We will also develop a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn an optimal intervention strategy based on the probability of events rather than in reaction to IDH events (Aim 2b). We will silently deploy and evaluate the ability of this artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to forecast IDH risk and recommend interventions in real-time across the two healthcare systems. We will then assess the validity of recommended interventions using an expert clinician adjudication panel (Aim 3a); and will compare the AI recommended interventions with that of actual interventions performed by bedside clinicians (Aim 3b). This proposal will be the harbinger of a future multicenter randomized clinical trial to examine personalized risk prediction and AI-augmented management of IDH among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and undergoing kidney replacement therapy in the intensive care unit. Project Narrative Among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and treated with dialysis in the intensive care unit, if one could accurately predict early which patients will develop low blood pressure then effective treatments could be given. In this study, we propose to develop and validate an artificial intelligence system that will predict low blood pressure even before they occur and recommend correct treatment to clinicians.",AI driven acute renal replacement therapy - (AID-ART),10371943,R01DK131586,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vasoconstrictor Agents ', ' Vasoactive Agonists ', ' Vasoconstrictor Drugs ', ' Vasoconstrictors ', ' Vasopressor Agents ', ' vasopressor ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Medical center ', ' acute kidney injury ', ' Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis ', ' Performance ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Structure ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' usability ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' augmented intelligence ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' learning algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,639669,PA-18
"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

"Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection PROJECT SUMMARY The overall purpose of this proposal is to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome in kidney transplant rejection, specifically in T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), as the response to treatment can be variable, is currently not predictable by clinical diagnostics nor understood from a mechanistic sense, and even partial treatment failure is associated with shortened graft longevity. In each aim, we make use of residual diagnostic biopsy samples with paired richly-detailed clinical data and timelines including treatments, graft functional responses and outcomes. In this manner, we track along the clinical timeline of TCMR, with each aim addressing an unsolved clinical problem in the field. Through the same approach, experimental data from this unique “model system” of tissue inflammation studied over time provides a rich discovery set for understanding tissue-resident T cell behavior in the human kidney. Aim 1 looks at the whole transcriptome profiles of initial acute episodes of TCMR prior to treatment, to identify a gene expression signature predictive of resistance/sensitivity to standard therapies for rejection. When treatment fails, grafts frequently contain residual T cell infiltrates, but the causal connection between these cells and long- term outcome is unclear. For example, residual infiltrates may represent (i) contracting/egressing populations of T cells effectively treated, (ii) newly recruited T cells mounting a fresh rejection response where repeat therapy may be prudent, or (iii) scant memory T cells with established tissue posts and capable of inciting repeat inflammation. Therefore, in Aim 2, we focus on post-treatment biopsies of treatment failure, characterizing multiple spatio-phenotypic aspects of the T cell infiltrate by high dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy with digital image processing and quantitative spatial analysis, to determine which functional phenotypic T cell subsets in which specific tissue niches, correlate with poor graft outcomes. These complementary but independent aims will be achieved through established cross-disciplinary collaborations and with partial industry support. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney transplantation is life saving and compared to dialysis improves patient quality of life and decreases healthcare costs over time, but graft longevity is compromised by immunologic rejection and inadequate immunosuppression. Timely appropriate therapy for rejection can preserve graft longevity, but biomarkers to predict response to therapy are lacking, leading some centers to over-treat, putting patients at risk of infection and malignancy, while clinical protocols at other centers may under-treat, putting patients at risk of accelerated graft decline. Therefore, development of tests to guide appropriate selection of therapy for rejection would be clinically useful, and discovery-based platforms for biomarker identification have the potential to yield not only clinically useful tests but also to reveal biologic mechanisms of treatment resistance and potential new targets for therapy.",Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney

"Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Injury is the most common cause of death in people younger than 46 years of age, and bleeding after injury is the most common cause of preventable death. Treatment of bleeding requires timely procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. Hospitals that specialize in treating injury have protocols, medications, devices and clinical staff available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Injured people treated at specialized hospitals are more likely to live. However, there are far too many injured people every year than can be treated at specialized hospitals so minor injuries are cared for at hospitals not specialized in treating injuries. Severely injured people are taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries when specialized hospitals are too far away, or the emergency medical personnel underestimate how seriously injured someone is. Hospitals not specialized in treating injuries do not participate in ongoing injury clinical trials, regional data registries nor national quality improvement programs, and as a result what happens there that leads to people bleeding to death is unknown. This application's long-term objective is to improve the timeliness of treatment of bleeding after injury. The Specific Aims will be to: 1) understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in treating injuries; 2) identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment; and3) determine how to improve the timeliness of treatment. The central hypothesis is that treatment of bleeding is not standardized in hospitals not specialized in treating injuries and leads to a delay in transferring injured people to specialized hospitals. Identifying modifiable healthcare system, hospital, and patient factors can inform the design of a systematic process to quickly temporarily stabalize bleeding of injured people initially at non-specialized centers then expedite transfer to specialized hospitals by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals. This will ensure that people who are bleeding after injury are cared for at the right place at the right time. Ultimately, the right treatment at the right time will give people initially taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries the same chance at life as those taken to specialized hospitals. As a Career Development Award, the proposed training plan will include training in data science, systems engineering and design. The methods to be learned and employed will be machine learning, failure mode, effects and criticality analysis and user-centered design. The health relatedness of the project is to understand current practice management of bleeding after injury, in order to improve the timeliness of bleeding treatments to enhance the health of injured inviduals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injury is the most common cause of death in people under 46 years old with more than 200,000 Americans dying annually. Bleeding accounts for 30% of deaths after injury, most of which are preventable if patients receive timely bleeding treatments including procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. The proposed resarch will understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in injury care, identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment, and then create an improved systematic process by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals caring for injured people.",Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy,10203288,K23HL157832,"['Algorithms ', ' Bleeding time procedure ', ' Bleeding Time ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Coagulation Disorders ', ' Coagulation Disorder ', ' Coagulopathy ', ' bleeding disorder ', ' clotting disorder ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency Medical Technicians ', ' Emergency Medicine Technicians ', ' Emergency Paramedics ', ' emergency medical personnel ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Hospitals ', ' Special Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Transfer ', ' Patients ', ' Interventional radiology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' trauma centers ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Time Management ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' blood product ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' Practice Management ', ' Devices ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' injured ', ' time use ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Trauma ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' user centered design ', ' engineering design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' standardized care ', ' data registry ', ' trauma care ', ' Patient Triage ', ' Trauma patient ', ' Data Science ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' stroke patient ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' severe injury ', ' critical injury ', ' devastating injury ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K23,2021,190279,IL-07
"Improving perioperative management to reduce postoperative acute kidney injury and long-term renal risk Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who undergo intraabdominal surgery procedures. AKI leads to increased risks of adverse outcomes such as hospital readmission and progression to chronic kidney disease, to reduced short- and long-term survival, and to greater costs to both patients and hospital systems. There are no effective treatments to prevent postoperative AKI, and as such, appropriate perioperative management is critical for mitigating its risk. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the ways in which patient and perioperative management factors interact to influence the risk of postoperative AKI. Traditional methods only identify generic, global risk factors and only quantify the average effects of each factor on AKI risk. Using an institutional cohort of intraabdominal surgery patients containing detailed preoperative (e.g., patient demographics, risk factors, comorbidities) and intraoperative data (e.g., hemodynamic variables, medications, fluid management), we will utilize a novel interpretable machine learning framework (SHAP [Shapley Additive exPlanations]) to model postoperative AKI risk. Machine learning provides the ability to model complex relationships among predictor variables, and SHAP quantifies the contribution to AKI risk for each variable in individual patients. We will compare this approach to traditional methods, comparing both predictive performance and the clinical understanding provided by the models. The knowledge gained will support the development and validation of novel, interpretable models in a large, multi-institution cohort and analyses to identify modifiable risk factors at all phases of the perioperative period so that personalized perioperative management strategies can be developed to reduce the risk of postoperative AKI and long-term renal outcomes. SPECIFIC AIMS Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and major cause of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. ADDIN EN.CITE 1 Postoperative AKI is associated with a 4-fold increased risk of mortality ADDIN EN.CITE 2 and increased costs (ranging from $12,100 to $47,700 per patient). ADDIN EN.CITE 3 AKI patients face greater long-term risks of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage renal disease (ESRD), and associated morbidity and mortality. ADDIN EN.CITE 4 Despite the severe ramifications of postoperative AKI, there are no effective strategies to identify individuals with an elevated risk or inform efforts to prevent its occurrence.5 Optimization of perioperative management may provide the greatest opportunity to fine-tune strategies to minimize AKI risk, as it is a volatile period with an abundance of potential opportunities for intervention. ADDIN EN.CITE 6,7 However, the complex relationships between perioperative factors and the risk of adverse renal outcomes have made it difficult to develop effective tools to guide perioperative patient management towards reducing AKI risk. Traditional risk stratification measures are limited in that they identify global risk factors but do not allow for personalized risk assessment at the level of an individual patient. We propose to use SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations), ADDIN EN.CITE 8-10 a novel framework that leverages the ability to fit complex models using machine learning approaches while providing interpretable explanations for individual patients.    We have extensive experience characterizing the epidemiology of postoperative AKI ADDIN EN.CITE 2,6,11,12 and the development of risk stratification tools for postoperative AKI ADDIN EN.CITE 13,14 and other surgical complications. ADDIN EN.CITE 15-21 Through the KL2 award from the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) Irving Institute (CTSA), we assembled a cohort of intraabdominal surgery patients at CUMC, linking extensive electronic health record data to American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) data. We found that the addition of detailed intraoperative data improved the risk prediction model for postoperative AKI containing only preoperative data ADDIN EN.CITE 7 and evaluated the ability of machine learning to incorporate preoperative and intraoperative data to predict mortality. The proposed project will utilize our CUMC/ACS NSQIP cohort (N=3834) to refine the development of interpretable machine learning models and demonstrate clinical utility to identify modifiable perioperative factors to reduce postoperative AKI and long-term renal risk. To achieve this, we plan to: Develop and validate personalized risk prediction models for postoperative AKI using interpretable machine learning. We will use both preoperative (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities, surgical procedure) and detailed intraoperative data (e.g., fluid types and volumes, medications [e.g., vasopressors], hemodynamic measures [e.g., heart rate, blood pressure]) to develop machine learning models for predicting the development of postoperative AKI, defined by the consensus KDIGO criteria.22 Machine learning provides the ability to fit complex models that account for nonlinear relationships among predictors, and various algorithms will be tested (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks, random forest). The SHAP framework quantifies the contribution of each variable to AKI risk (both increases and decreases) for individual patients. We will compare performance to traditional approaches (i.e., parsimonious risk factor model using traditional logistic regression). We hypothesize that the machine learning/SHAP approach will have improved performance and provide a more robust understanding of critical risk factors and the heterogeneity of their effects on AKI risk among patients. This data will serve as the foundation to support the development and validation of novel, interpretable risk prediction models at all stages of the perioperative period (i.e., prior to surgery, during surgery, and immediately after surgery) in a large, multi-institutional cohort at 3 major academic centers. The knowledge gained will identify modifiable risk factors at all phases of the perioperative period so that personalized perioperative management strategies can be developed to reduce the risk of postoperative AKI and long-term renal outcomes.

"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD. These tools will allow providers to make informed treatment decisions as well as lay the groundwork for further precision research into optimized patient care. NARRATIVE End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies. However, there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy.
