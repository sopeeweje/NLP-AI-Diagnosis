"Automated Presurgical Language Mapping via Deep Learning for Multimodal Brain Connectivity Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a primary brain tumor each year. Neu- rosurgery remains the ﬁrst and most common therapeutic option for these patients with outcomes linked to the extent of tumor resection. However, larger resections also increase the risk for postoperative deﬁcits, particularly in the motor and language areas of the eloquent cortex. Task fMRI (t-fMRI) has emerged as a powerful nonin- vasive tool for preoperative mapping, but these acquisitions are lengthy and cognitively demanding for patients. Moreover, t-fMRI is unreliable if the patient cannot perform the tasks while in the scanner. Our long-term goal is to develop an automated platform for reliable eloquent cortex mapping across a broad patient cohort that comple- ments the existing clinical workﬂow. The overall objective of this proposal is to design and validate new machine learning algorithms that leverage the complementary strengths of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (d-MRI), which are both passive modalities and easy to acquire. Our central hypothesis is that the combined structural-functional connectivity information in these modalities will enable us to localize language functionality in patients with brain tumors. Our innovative strategy uses recent advancements in deep learning to capture com- plex interactions in the rs-fMRI and d-MRI data that collectively deﬁne the language areas. We will evaluate our hypothesis via two speciﬁc aims. In Aim 1 we will develop a graph neural network (GNN) that employs specialized convolutional ﬁlters to capture topological properties of the connectivity data across multiple scales. Our GNN will be trained in a supervised fashion and evaluated against t-fMRI activations and intraoperative electrocortical stimulation. In Aim 2 we will conduct an exploratory analysis to retrospectively link our GNN predictions to post- operative changes in language functionality. Namely, we hypothesize that patients for whom the surgical path intersects our GNN predictions will experience greater deﬁcits across ﬁne-grained language subdomains. We will also assess the prognostic value of our GNN predictions, as compared to other clinical factors. We anticipate the proposed research will have a transformative impact on surgical planning by helping neurosurgeons to plan more targeted and safer surgeries, thus improving patient outcomes and overall quality of care. Project Narrative The proposed research addresses a critical and unmet public health need in managing primary brain tumors by improving the accuracy of eloquent cortex mapping during preoperative planning. The algorithms developed through these efforts will help to streamline the surgical procedures and mitigate the risk for postoperative deﬁcits, towards the ultimate goal of improving both quality of care and long-term clinical outcomes.",Automated Presurgical Language Mapping via Deep Learning for Multimodal Brain Connectivity,10286181,R21CA263804,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Equipment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hospitals ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Sleep ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Primary Brain Tumors ', ' Primary Brain Neoplasms ', ' Property ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' independent component analysis ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Network-based ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' patient population ', ' common treatment ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' care costs ', ' preservation ', ' Grain ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multilayer perceptron ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,221368,MD-07
"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health

"CRCNS: Discovering Computational Principles of Language Processing in the Brain A critical characteristic of human language is our ability to understand multi-word sequences whose meaning is greater than the sum of their parts. Recent work from the PIs of this proposal (Toneva and Wehbe, 2019; Jain and Huth, 2018) and others (Schrimpf et al., 2020a; Caucheteux & King, 2020) has shown that cortical representations of multi-word sequences can be modeled much more accurately than before by using neural network language models, a machine learning technique that has revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019). However, under the current paradigm these models must first be trained on separate NLP tasks and only then used to model the brain, creating a guess-and-check cycle that is not guaranteed to converge on the actual computations that humans perform. Here we propose to break this cycle by directly training neural network models to estimate the functions that the brain uses to combine words. To be able to optimally predict fMRI and MEG responses, these models will need to capture the composition principles governing which words the brain attends to, and how information is combined across words. These models will help uncover specific computations underlying language processing in the brain, enable computational testing of neurolinguistic theories, and inspire or directly improve models used in NLP.  Accomplishing these goals, however, will require overcoming one major obstacle. Training neural net- work language models typically requires orders of magnitude more data than existing neuroimaging datasets. To address this issue, one central goal of this proposed project is to collect a very large fMRI and MEG dataset comprising roughly one million words of natural language stimuli. We plan to use the unique dataset and computational modeling framework to address three scientific aims. Aim 1: Create brain activity prediction benchmarks to foster interaction between neuroscience and NLP. Aim 2: Use data-driven models to test existing neurolinguistic theories & develop new accounts of the computations underlying word composition in the brain. Aim 3: Leverage information in different brain areas to help solve computationally defined language tasks.  Successful completion of the proposed work will provide mechanistic insight into language processing, with a computational architecture tracing information flow among brain areas and describing the tasks they perform. Beyond its basic cognitive neuroscience implications, we expect this work will enable better understanding of language impairments and help identify targeted therapies. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Through collecting, analyzing, and disseminating large-scale neuroimaging datasets collected while participants listen to natural, narrative speech, this proposal aims to improve our understanding of the normal function of the language system. Specifically, this work seeks to improve and validate computational models of speech language processing in the human brain.

"Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge ABSTRACT Language and memory overlap heavily in brain circuitry and in our day-to-day lives. Both are also frequently disrupted in neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which cortical language centers integrate with memory circuits; for example, to support the retrieval of linguistic knowledge. This limits our insight into disease pathophysiology and slows the development of more effective therapies for cognitive impairments. This K23 will support an investigation of how language and memory integrate in the human brain, by harnessing unique innovations and resources. First, we will use special high-density grid and depth electrodes to record from many hundreds of local neuronal populations distributed throughout memory and language centers, among patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy. Second, to target distinct moments of linguistic-mnemonic integration, we have customized an auditory naming behavioral task that combines controlled yet natural language stimuli with memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge. Third, I will apply state-of-the-art analyses with pattern classifiers and computational linguistics, an approach that could improve the framework of how we understand neural representations of deep language processing. I will first evaluate whether the activity patterns in cortical language centers and the hippocampus reveal neural signatures of dynamic integration during knowledge retrieval, and whether their activity patterns reflect mutual information sufficient to predict the linguistic content of task trials (Aim 1). I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives.

"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment.

"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,10105196,R01DC016273,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Infant ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Parents ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Standardization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' translational approach ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard measure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' model building ', ' language impairment ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,653332,IL-07
"AI/ML-Readiness for Neuroimaging of Language Project Summary/Abstract Conceptual or semantic knowledge refers to information about objects, actions, relations, self, culture, and includes meanings of words and phrases. The use of this knowledge is pervasive and automatic in daily life. Everyday activities such as communication, recognition and use of objects, social interactions, and decision making are crucially reliant on conceptual knowledge. Impairment of this complex and widely distributed system has serious consequences for quality of life. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with the impairment of this system, including stroke with aphasia, dementias, temporal lobe epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. Understanding the structure and organization of this system, and the specific ways it is disrupted in these individuals, is critical for developing better treatments and rehabilitation strategies. The goal of this research is to understand the structure and use of this information, its neural basis, and the ways in which it can be impaired by neuropathology. This project pertains to three neuroimaging datasets — two functional MRI and one from stroke survivors — that speak to the neural basis of concepts and language processing in the brain. We aim to transform these data and associated metadata to a “machine learning ready” format and make them easily accessible. This will enable application of powerful modern machine learning techniques, such as Deep Learning, for their analysis. We expect that these analyses will shed new light on the organization and function of this core semantic region in the healthy and impaired brain. Project Narrative Understanding how conceptual information is organized, represented in the brain, and affected by neuropathology is a major focus of research, as it has direct relevance to many neurological disorders. This supplement aims to make data from three neuroimaging datasets relating to conceptual processing “machine learning ready.” We expect that application of Deep Learning to these rich datasets will result in substantial new insights into the neural basis of language, and be valuable for understanding and treating language disorders.",AI/ML-Readiness for Neuroimaging of Language,10412576,R01DC017162,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Distributed Systems ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Noise ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' angular gyrus ', ' Structure of middle temporal gyrus ', ' Middle Temporal Gyrus ', ' Anterior ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' Inferior ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Property ', ' social cognition ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' neuropathology ', ' Complex Extracts ', ' Crude Extracts ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Impairment ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' parent grant ', ' treatment strategy ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' stroke survivor ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' deep learning ', ' feature selection ', ' support vector machine ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,287390,SC-06
