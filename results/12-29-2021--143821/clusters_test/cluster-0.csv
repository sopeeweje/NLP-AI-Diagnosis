"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory

"Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups Intricate social hierarchies that go through both dynamic and stable phases exist in species ranging from humans to mice to insects and have been richly described in psychology and ecology, but virtually nothing is known about the neural circuit mechanisms that govern the remarkable coordination of large groups of animals. Systems neuroscience has exploded with a number of novel technologies, yet the culture of this field has been largely reductionist – focusing on animals living in isolation or with a single-digit number of cage mates performing highly-controlled tasks. Although there is abundant ongoing research in the domain of social reward (motivation to engage in social behavior for hedonic value that social interaction provides), there is no ongoing research (to my knowledge) examining the neural representation of a negative valence need state (a loneliness-like state), the social homeostatic set-point, or how this is related to social rank. Indeed, this unexplored face of social behavior may have greater relevance to mental health and the burden on society. This proposal is completely different from any previous work done by myself or any investigator because we will do the following: 1) present a model for social homeostasis where social rank dictates the set-point for quality/quantity of social contact; 2) bridge behavioral ecology and systems neuroscience by using complex, naturalistic vivariums of large groups of mice in combination with nascent neural recording technology and expertise across a wide range of functional circuit dissection techniques; 3) simultaneously record across many brains using wireless recording devices to determine how composite dominance hierarchy is represented and determine whether meta-brain patterns for group social homeostasis (in both stable and dynamic phases) exist and observe how they change during dominance hierarchical reorganizations; and 4) identify site(s) and circuit(s) that represent social rank by applying machine learning approaches to decode ensembles that accurately predict the animal’s social rank, and use this information to move towards a mathematical model for social homeostasis on a supraorganismal group level. I propose to bring my expertise in modern systems neuroscience circuit dissection to reveal the neural underpinnings of social homeostasis on both an individual and group level. On an individual level, I seek to understand how deficits between the experienced social contact and the expectations dependent on social rank within a dominance hierarchy are represented within the brain, and how these signals are translated into motivational drive states. When investigating the neural representation of social homeostasis on the group level, we will record simultaneously in many animals using wireless devices within a naturalistic vivarium in a complex social hierarchy and look for a composite representation of the social supraorganismal group.",Neural Circuit Mechanisms of Social Homeostasis in Individuals and Supraorganismal Social Groups,10223194,DP1AT009925,"['Animals ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Dissection ', ' Ecology ', ' Bionomics ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Social Hierarchy ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Modernization ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Dominance ', ' Dominance Hierarchy ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Values ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social group ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Behavioral ', ' virtual ', ' hedonic ', ' Negative Valence ', ' ']",NCCIH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP1,2021,1346800,CA-49
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,10207798,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials ', ' Animal Feed ', ' animal food ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Biogenic Amines ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' Cues ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nematoda ', ' Nematodes ', ' roundworm ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Synaptic Transmission ', ' Neural Transmission ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Physiology ', ' Serotonin ', ' 5-HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5HT ', ' Enteramine ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Sleep ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' mutant ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neurotransmitter release ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Stretching ', ' Structure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Global Change ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Imaging technology ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' network models ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' neural patterning ', ' optogenetics ', ' food environment ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' sensory input ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' connectome ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' squid axon ', ' squid axoplasm ', ' squid giant axon ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,455727,MA-07
"Astrocyte Modulation of Neural Circuit Function and Behavior Project Summary: Overall “What is the function of glial cells in neural centers? The answer is still not known, and it may remain unsolved for many years to come until scientists find direct methods to attack it.” (Ramon y Cajal, 1901). This prophecy turned out to be accurate. Astrocytes, one of the most abundant cell types in the brain, have long been thought of as primarily passive support cells. Over the past two decades, studies indicate that astrocytes play pivotal roles in nervous system development, function, and diseases. However, a major unresolved issue in neuroscience is how astrocytes integrate diverse neuronal signals under healthy conditions, modulate neural circuit structure and function at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and how aberrant excitation and molecular output influences sensorimotor behavior and contributes to disease. The overall goal of this U19 Team-Research BRAIN Circuit Program proposal is to address this fundamental issue by developing a deeper mechanistic understanding of astrocytes’ roles in neural circuit operation, complex behaviors, and brain computation theories. Two overarching questions will be addressed: 1) How do astrocytes temporally and spatially integrate molecular signals from the diverse types of local and projection neurons activated during sensorimotor behaviors. 2) How do astrocytes convert this information into functional outputs that modulate neural circuit structure and function at different spatial and temporal scales. A multidisciplinary, comprehensive effort is proposed to address these questions that can only be completed through close collaboration between researchers with unique and complementary expertise. An innovative multi-scale approach integrating functional, anatomical, and genetic analyses with theoretical modeling will be leveraged. This approach involves quantitative behavioral assays, large-scale imaging of cellular and molecular dynamics, targeted cell-type-specific manipulations, high- throughput omic techniques, genetic profiling, protein engineering, machine learning, and computational modeling. By integrating experimental and theoretical approaches, molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms will be determined through which astrocytes influence neural circuits and contribute to complex behaviors and brain computation theories. The experimental and data analysis tools developed as part of this project will be invaluable for the broader neuroscience community. Project Narrative: Overall The human brain contains roughly equal numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. A major unresolved issue in understanding brain function is how the non-neuronal cells integrate neuronal molecular signals, modulate neural circuit structure and function at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and mediate changes in information processing, perception, and behavior. This project will employ a broad range of experimental and theoretical approaches to identify core principles of the bi-directional communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells in various brain regions and how disrupting this regular communication transforms perception and action in health and disease.",Astrocyte Modulation of Neural Circuit Function and Behavior,10294800,U19NS123719,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' nervous system development ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' genetic profiling ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' experimental analysis ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' synaptic function ', ' synapse function ', ' brain research ', ' tool development ', ' information processing ', ' operation ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Data Science Core ', ' Data Science Resource Core ', ' ']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,U19,2021,2232623,CA-49
"Model organism neural circuit knowledge graph Project Summary To extract greater value from extensive but disparate and siloed data relevant to neural circuits, we will leverage the ontologies, bioinformatics, and curation of the Alliance of Genome Resources to derive an artificial intelligence (AI) ready knowledge graph. Participation of a computational neuroscientist who uses AI for neural circuit analyses will help specify the form of the knowledge graph, demonstrate the utility of the graphs, extend the graphs from a focus on the well-defined nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans to the similarly well- defined mouse retina, and connect with neuroscience researchers who are starting to applying AI to neural circuits. Known entities (such as neurons, small molecules, and neuropeptides) and Ontologies (anatomy, relations, and experimental evidence) provide the underlying data of the graph. Curated assertions provide the knowledge, e.g., synaptic or functional connections between neurons, neuropeptide has a specific receptor, or a neuropeptide is expressed in a specific neuron). In this graph model, entities are the nodes, ontological relationships are the edges. These provide an inferred knowledge graph supported by evidence backed assertions. This type of knowledge graph can be applied to biological pathways that are based on phenotype observations including expression, neuronal activity and organismal behavior rather than physical interactions or enzymatic activities such as those used to describe biochemical pathways. To accomplish generation of knowledge graphs, we will refine the relevant vocabularies to focus on relations used in neural circuit research, we will adjust existing infrastructure to handle the appropriate ontologies, data models, and curation tools for neural circuit data, and we will incentivize expert contributions by arranging short reviews coupled to computable assertions. The knowledge graph will be used by local AI experts, published on the internet, and tested by a hackathon. Project Narrative There are large amounts of high-quality data that are underutilized in our attempt to understand the structure and function of neural circuits. In particular the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches could be enabled by having these data in computable form and available via simple download or application programming interface (API).

"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,10132411,R01NS105200,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hybrids ', ' Information Networks ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' sensor ', ' Pyramidal Cells ', ' Link ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' electrical property ', ' experience ', ' immunoreactivity ', ' voltage ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' patch clamp ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' environmental enrichment for laboratory animals ', ' environment enrichment ', ' environment enrichment for laboratory animals ', ' environmental enrichment ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Interneuron function ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' translatome ', ' neural network ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' rabies viral tracing ', ' rabies tracing ', ' rabies virus tracing ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,403711,WI-02
