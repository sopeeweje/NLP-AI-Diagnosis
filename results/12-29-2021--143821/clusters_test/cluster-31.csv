"Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health Records Up to 100 million Americans live with ongoing pain, costing $635 billion annually. In the United States, there are more than 200,000 people living with SLE, a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease with multi-organ involvement that disproportionately affects females and racial minorities. Living with a chronic disease such as SLE confers multiple challenges. Pain is a frequent self-reported symptom in SLE and is often one of the first symptoms of the disease. Despite treatment advances, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint. The management of pain in SLE has recently become more challenging because of the alarming epidemic of addiction and mortality attributed to opioid misuse. An estimated 31-46% of patients with SLE use prescription opioids. In one study, 70% of individuals using opioids used them for ≥1 year, and 22% were taking ≥2 opioid medications at the same time. Patients with SLE are nearly twice as likely as the general population to have opioid-related overdose hospitalizations. However, efforts to mitigate opioid misuse cannot be achieved without a detailed understanding and sustained investment in clinical research on the underlying mechanisms that produce and maintain chronic pain. Characterizing the burden of chronic pain in SLE is challenging on at least two counts. First, we lack data on the prevalence and burden of chronic pain in SLE, partly due to the absence of reliable approaches to identify patients with clinically significant pain in electronic health records (EHR). Second, there is a critical need to understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms and correlates that drive the pain experience in SLE. In this mentored career development award (K01), Dr. Titilola Falasinnu will use computational methods to increase the understanding of the clinical management chronic pain in SLE using EHR. In Aim 1, Dr. Falasinnu will develop a computational chronic pain phenotyping algorithm using diagnostic codes, pain scores, narrative clinic notes and medications extracted from the EHRs of two large healthcare systems (n~2,400). She will then use the algorithm to estimate chronic pain prevalence in a population-based registry (n~76,000). In Aim 2, Dr. Falasinnu will comprehensively phenotype biopsychosocial correlates of chronic pain using an existing registry of ~500 patients with SLE attending a multi-disciplinary pain center. Throughout the award, Dr. Falasinnu will build on her doctoral training as an epidemiologist and biostatistician to develop new skills in biomedical informatics to conduct impactful pain medicine research. These skills will include working with EHR and registry data, machine learning and natural language processing, pain science, grant-writing, and scientific communication. Through coursework, clinical observation in pain medicine clinics, mentorship, and external conferences and workshops, Dr. Falasinnu will gain the skills needed to apply for her first R01 and pursue a career as a tenure-track principal investigator. Despite treatment advances in rheumatology, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient complaint in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition that disproportionately affects women and racial minorities. The proposed research uses electronic health records to characterize chronic pain and its biopsychosocial mechanisms in SLE. The information learned from the study is relevant to public health efforts to understand the burden and natural history of pain; and it is also relevant to NIAM’s mission of improving the understanding of biopsychosocial components of pain in rheumatology.",Characterization of Chronic Pain and its Biopsychosocial Mechanisms in Lupus using Electronic Health

"Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management ABSTRACT Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical as poor management can impair recovery and lead to adverse events, including prolonged opioid use and transition to chronic pain. Literature suggests significant disparities exist with regard to pain management and its quality-of-life impacts, particularly among vulnerable populations (e.g. depressed, obese and diabetics). However, there lacks risk stratification tools to identify individuals at high risk for these disparate pain outcomes. Although pain scores are routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs), shared algorithms to utilize them for care improvement are limited. To advance the efficient and effective use of the abundant amount of electronic data now available, a common data model (CDM) is necessary: standardized structures, terminologies, and rules to represent EHR data. Using a CMD for postoperative pain research would facilitate timely evidence generation across multiple populations and settings, which can provide critical evidence to stakeholders and move the field away from pain treatment for the ‘average’ patient to pain treatment for an individual. In this grant, we propose an innovative approach to advance the systematic analysis of postoperative pain across populations. Our approach will leverage the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to develop tools that use standardize data formats and naming conventions; OMOP has over 140 collaborating sites gloablly. We will further utilize analytical tools developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) on this CDM to facilitate disseminate across the research community. Our approach will develop scalable, open source risk stratification tools for adverse pain outcomes across diverse populations. We will accomplish this work in three aims. First, we will develop clinical phenotypes to identify and extract key discriminating features necessary to assess postoperative pain using EHRs. Next, we will develop pain risk stratification models using machine learning, including deep learning, methods and tools based on phenotypes developed in Aim 1. Finally, we will validate our models externally at the VA and disseminate our work through open source libraries and public websites. This project will deliver validated risk-stratification tools derived from real world evidence to identify patients at high risk for adverse pain outcomes following surgery, which can potentially reduce prescribed opioids circulating in the community– a key to curbing the opioid epidemic. NARRATIVE Surgery is common and appropriate postoperative pain management is critical, as poor management can impair recovery, lead to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life; yet, there are significant disparities with regard to pain and its management, particularly in vulnerable populations. The proposed research will develop evidence needed to identify patients at high risk for adverse postoperative pain outcomes. Models will be developed at a tertiary academic health center, validated at the Veterans Health Administration and disseminated to the community via a publicly available website, common data model and open source libraries.",Advancing Knowledge Discovery for Postoperative Pain Management,10165821,R01LM013362,"['opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' pain outcome ', ' pain score ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' random forest ', ' informatics tool ', ' structured data ', ' unstructured data ', ' support vector machine ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' pain chronification ', ' chronic pain transition ', ' transition to chronic pain ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' pain after surgery ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' diabetic ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' analgesia ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' model development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Pain Research ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Adjuvant ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' risk sharing ', ' analytical tool ', ' fundamental research ', ' open source ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' population based ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' data format ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' opiate tolerance ', ' opioid habituation ', ' opioid tolerance ', ' tolerance to opiates ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' health data ', ' depressed patient ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Data Science ', ' ']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644033,CA-18
"Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) PROJECT SUMMARY Analgesics are among the most commonly prescribed medications, and opioid painkillers are the gold standard for the management of severe acute pain, and for many chronic pain conditions. More than 30% of the U.S. population suffers from chronic pain, and nearly 40% of older adults report debilitating chronic pain conditions not caused by cancer. However, side effects of opioids, including tolerance, physical dependence, and respiratory depression have limited their effectiveness as pain killers. Rates of addiction and opioid overdose have escalated to a point of crisis. In the United States, on average approximately 115 people die every day from accidental overdose. Better, efficacious and safe opioid analgesic drugs with reduced risk of use are urgently needed. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) – an integrated knowledgebase aimed at accelerating and improving the success of translational research and drug discovery programs towards the identification of efficacious and save opioid drugs. ODO will enable multi-tiered analyses across diverse data types and hypothesis development for example by connecting chemical structure, biochemical binding profiles, pharmacological responses in animals and drug side effects and thus enable more effective rational drug discovery programs. To develop ODO we will leverage our extensive previous work in several research consortia developing formal ontologies, data standards, processing and integration methods, and software systems to enable integrated access, query and analysis of large scale and diverse data types. The current proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the ODO integrated knowledgebase and illustrate proof of concept via two Specific Aims: (1) to curate and harmonize ODO content from diverse data sources via a semantic knowledge model enabling integration of diverse data types, and (2) to deploy the ODO integrated Data Portal and Search Engine engaging the community and demonstrate its heuristic value. We envision that the ODO will pave the way to enable advanced machine learning and link results from molecular simulations with opioid analgesic drug pharmacology and functional selectivity, thus facilitating, at larger scale, the rational, predictive design, and scaffold optimization in drug development efforts towards identifying safer opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pain is the number one reason people seek medical attention. Although narcotic pain killers are effective, they are highly addictive and have severe side effects. Doctors need better opioid drugs to treat moderate to severe pain. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO), the first public opioid drug knowledgebase with the capability to use machine learning tools to help scientists design new drugs to treat pain without harmful side effects.",Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO),10228543,R21DA048313,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person

"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Development and analysis of new mathematical and statistical models for chronic pain Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Abrams, Daniel, M Project Description  1. Intellectual merit (see Sec. 2, pages 13-14, for ""Broader impacts"") 1.1 Introduction and background 1.1.1 General introduction During recent decades there has been an extraordinary growth in the availability of data relating to a wide range of microbiological systems. That data has enabled new quantitative approaches to biology, including the development of new mathematical and statistical models that given fun- damental insight into the workings of biological systems.  Another source is now growing explosively: biomedical data. This data has significant potential for use in treatment of human disease, but thus far comparatively fewer mathematical models for medical phenomena have been developed. The hope is that quantitative models will allow for ""personalized"" or ""precision"" medicine, where treatment protocols are customized based on an understanding of how individual patient characteristics impact the effectiveness of the treatment. Deep mathematical understanding of biomedical systems also promises to allow for optimization of medical interventions: the physical and/or financial costs of intervention could be minimized for a given desired level of benefit.  The broad goal of the proposed research is to develop new integrative mathematical models for the dynamics of subjective pain in patients suffering from chronic pain. These models will combine existing qualitative knowledge with insight gained from newly available patient data, with the goal of incorporating data streams corning on line in the near future. We plan to develop multiple models in parallel using a variety of approaches and then to select the best rnodel(s) based on agreement with objective data. 1.1.2 Background on biological application: Sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness associated with frequent medical complications and hospitalizations. Approximately 90% of acute care visits are for pain events, and 30-day reuti- lization rates are alarmingly high [27]. While factors influenci.ng these high re-utilization rates are poorly understood, close follow-up and continued use of pain medication has been shown to de- crease re-hospitalization rates. Mobile technology has become an integral part of health care management and Pl Shah's recently developed mobile application (SMART app - see Figure 1) for SCD assists with documentation of pain and interventions. 1.1.3 Background on hybrid approach Perhaps because of the often distinct educational backgrounds of practitioners or distinct typical applications, statistical and mechanistic approaches are not frequently combined in addressing a single problem. The majority of attempts in the scientific literature have appeared in the context of neural networks [37, 38, 29] and chemical engineering [38, 33, 11], where they largely play a computational rather than analytical role. Some attempts have also been made with medical applications: Rosenberg et al. [30] and Adams et al. [4] developed a model by combining a dy- namical systems approach with a statistical model to predict a patient's CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load over time in an HIV study. Timms et al.

"A Multimodal Approach for Monitoring Prolonged Acute Pain in Neonates Most hospitalized infants experience painful procedures as a part of their care. Repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during early life is associated with permanent changes in brain structure and function and may lead to behavioral and developmental disabilities. Caregivers recognize the need to treat pain in infants but may be reluctant to administer analgesics because of potential short- and long-term side effects. Assessing pain in this vulnerable patient population is difficult as their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage. This difficulty may lead to both over- and under-treatment of pain, placing infants at risk for permanent neurologic injury. We propose to develop models and computer algorithms to automatically and continuously assess pain in neonates based on behavioral and physiological pain indicators.  To achieve this goal, the proposal has two aims: aim 1- Continuously and synchronously record contextual, behavioral and physiological signals from neonates in the NICU while they are undergoing prolonged acute pain; aim 2 - developing a multimodal system for assessing postoperative pain in neonates. The proposed system would generate continuous and standardized pain scores comparable to those obtained by conventional nurse-derived pain scores. It would improve care outcomes by enhancing the assessment of pain while decreasing the burden of pain documentation. It can also eliminate issues of inter-rater reliability associated with conventional neonatal pain assessment. The proposed data collection plan was designed based on our preliminary results and statistical analysis. The proposed system will be evaluated using standard performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, Cohen’s kappa coefficient, or their variations.  The interdisciplinary team includes a neonatologist, Dr. Ho, who is a faculty of both USF College of Medicine and College of Nursing. She practices and oversees the clinical research projects at the Tampa General Hospital NICU (the teaching hospital for USF Health). She ensures the team’s access to the NICU patient population for enrollment. She supervises the performance of the study including nursing pain assessment, video recording, and data collection. The team also includes a professor in nursing who specializes in neonatal opioids dependence and pain, an experienced research nurse, two computer science professors, and one statistics professor. The proposed work aligns very well with the NINR’s mission “to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities.” The proposed neonatal pain assessment approach will provide a tool for nurses to assess pain continuously and more accurately. Pain is one of the critical factors affecting the brain development in neonates, especially in preterm neonates, with chronic illnesses. The incidence of perterm neonates exposed to pain in high and pain assessment and management remain a primary focus of neonatal nursing research. For infants in the NICU coping with pain, the proposed nursing research will enable proper pain treatment that will also improve their long-term outcomes and development. Project Narrative Hospitalized infants may experience hundreds of painful procedures, repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during this early developmental period is associated with permanent alterations in brain structure and function. Assessing pain in this vulnerable population of patients is difficult because their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage. In this application, the investigators propose to refine and evaluate a novel automated multimodal computer aided pain assessment tool to aid in reliable diagnosis and prompt treatment of pain leading to improved outcomes.",A Multimodal Approach for Monitoring Prolonged Acute Pain in Neonates,10218273,R21NR018756,"['Affect ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment

"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in

"Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disorders of the spine have a tremendous impact on society; both physically through the morbidity of afflicted individuals, and financially, through lost productivity and increased health care costs. Despite the significance of this problem, the etiology of symptoms is diverse and unclear in many patients, and there are few reliable methods by which to prospectively determine the appropriate course of patient care and to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions. Challenges contributing to this major healthcare dilemma include numerous sources of back pain, difficulty in visualization of responsible tissues using any single imaging technique and difficulty in the localization of pain and contributing molecular processes. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MR) has been used to characterize disc, muscle, nerves and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been used to study bone turnover, and facet disease in subjects with lower back pain.  The research and tool development proposed in this UH2/UH3 takes the critical next step in the clinical translation of faster, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of patients with lower back pain. New optimized techniques and patient studies are required to investigate its clinical potential for quantitatively characterizing the tissues implicated in lower back pain, and objective evaluation of pain. Our proposed multidisciplinary Technology Research Site (Tech Site) of the NIH Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) will develop Phase IV TTMs (Research and Development for Technology Optimization) to leverage two key technical advancements – development of machine learning based faster MR acquisition methods, and machine learning for image segmentation and extraction of objective disease related features from images. We will develop, validate, and deploy end-to-end deep learning-based technologies (TTMs) for accelerated image reconstruction, tissue segmentation, detection of spinal degeneration, to facilitate automated, robust assessment of structure-function relationships between spine characteristics, neurocognitive pain response, and patient reported outcomes. To accomplish this important project, we have assembled a highly-experienced multidisciplinary research team combining extensive expertise MR bioengineering, advanced MRI data analysis, radiology, neuroscience, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, multi-dimensional analytics and have existing research agreements with industry. The research facilities and environment include the clinical and research infrastructure required for successful completion of the proposed translational project. The team has disseminated tools before to academia, worked closely with industry and are motivated to totally work with BACPAC as the plans of the consortium evolve. PROJECT NARRATIVE The successful outcome of the proposed project will result in the development and translation into the clinical setting of new methods to enable greatly improved imaging of lower back pain in human subjects. While this project focuses on lower back pain, these new imaging techniques could ultimately benefit the clinical management of other musculoskeletal pain.","Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC",10304082,UH3AR076724,"['Back Pain ', ' Back Ache ', ' Backache ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Industry ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Backache ', ' Lumbago ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Productivity ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Societies ', ' Spinal Diseases ', ' spine disorder ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Spinal ', ' experience ', ' research facility ', ' Agreement ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Academia ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' bone turnover ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tool development ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' technology research and development ', ' technological research and development ', ' deep learning ', ' Patient imaging ', ' Visualization ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Orthopedic Surgery ', ' ']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH3,2021,166865,CA-12
"Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat pain but have serious side effects, including addiction, dependence, and death from overdose. While there is a significant need for new non-addictive analgesics, efforts to develop new pain medicines have met with limited success. In part, this failure is due to an overreliance on evoked pain measures in preclinical models. Indeed, most preclinical models do not measure spontaneous pain—the main symptom of chronic pain in humans. To increase translational relevance, the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was developed to quantify characteristic facial expressions associated with spontaneous pain. The MGS is reproducible across labs and was used to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics. However, the MGS has not been widely adopted due to its high resource demands and low throughput. To overcome this limitation, we adapted a machine learning model to classify the presence or absence of pain from mouse facial expressions. We called this model the automated Mouse Grimace Scale (aMGS). After training, this model identified mice in pain with 94% accuracy, comparable to a highly-trained human. However, our original “aMGS 1.0” is limited in several respects. It is only accurate at detecting facial grimacing in white- coated mice, and produces a binary assessment (“pain” vs. “no pain”) instead of a graded score. Moreover, aMGS 1.0 cannot dynamically determine pain status from full-motion videos. Additionally, we relied on an older piece of software that does not consistently extract high-quality images of the mouse face. The aMGS 1.0 also has difficulty distinguishing between images of sleeping and grimacing mice. Finally, aMGS 1.0 suffers from a “black box” problem inherent to most machine learning algorithms, in that we do not know what facial details it uses to produce a pain assessment. Here we propose to overcome all of these limitations by developing a more sophisticated version of our automated pain classifier (aMGS 2.0). To achieve this goal we will: 1) Develop and validate a new open-source platform to classify (frame-by-frame) spontaneous pain intensity from mouse facial expressions, using albino (white) mice and motion information. 2) Enhance the generality of aMGS 2.0 for use with black mice. And, 3) Develop a user-friendly web-based platform that operates on computer-based and mobile devices. We will validate the utility of aMGS with three pain assays that produce grimaces in rodents—inflammatory pain, post-surgical (laparotomy) pain, and neuropathic pain. To increase rigor and reproducibility, two pain assays will be performed and scored with aMGS 2.0 in an independent lab. Numerous investigators in the pain field have expressed interest in using our proposed model. The platform will include a cloud-based data repository and analytic tools to facilitate curation of public data, continuous improvement of the model over time, and integration of new analytic tools. One analytic tool that we plan to develop will identify mouse features that most influence pain classification. NARRATIVE As the opioid epidemic has made clear, there is significant need to develop new ways to study chronic pain and relief of pain in preclinical models. Development of an accurate and broadly useful machine learning model and web-based platform will make it possible for researchers to objectively quantify and study spontaneous pain in mice, and hence provide a way to more rapidly identify and validate new analgesic drugs.",Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions,10094266,R01NS114259,"['Acetic

"Mentoring in Discovery and Validation of Clinical Chronic Pain Biomarkers The primary goal of this K24 application is to allow Sean Mackey, M.D., Ph.D., to build and expand on his high- quality and intensive mentorship of early-career investigators in patient-oriented research (POR). Dr. Mackey is the Redlich Professor and Chief, Division of Pain Medicine at Stanford University. This K24 provides Dr. Mackey with the critical protected time for POR and mentoring that would otherwise be spent on administrative and clinical responsibilities.  Dr. Mackey's mentoring plan for this K24 application builds on his currently funded HEAL project entitled: “Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for high-impact chronic pain: Development and validation”. Chronic pain represents a public health crisis that affects more than 100 million Americans and costs over $500 billion annually. An estimated 8% of US adults suffer from high-impact chronic pain, or pain associated with substantially restricted work, social, and self-care activities for six or more months. Subgroups of individuals respond entirely, do not change, or even worsen following pain management. Thus, robust and validated diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are needed to identify those with high-impact chronic pain and determine the trajectory of outcome (i.e., recovery versus persistence), respectively. Therefore, our overall goal is to discover and validate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for musculoskeletal high-impact chronic pain. This goal will require comprehensive, multidimensional assessments with an integrated dataset and a sophisticated computational analysis pipeline to yield reliable and validated diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. To this end, we have assembled an interdisciplinary research and clinical team to implement the HEAL initiative.  Dr. Mackey's mentoring plan includes training his mentees in: 1) designing and implementing pain research studies; 2) preparing scientific papers and presentations; 3) writing successful grant applications; 4) the responsible conduct of research; and 5) successful navigation of the academic process to achieve scientific independence. This mentoring plan will be applied to the K grantees he mentors and those he oversees as the Program Director for his NIDA T32 “Interdisciplinary Research Training in Pain and Substance Use Disorders.” The mentees will engage in the training activites in three manners. The first is through direct involvement in the parent R61/R33 biomarker project via participation in aspects of the research project. The second is through seminars, journal clubs, meetings, and coursework that expands on our T32 Training Program focusing on this HEAL biomarker project. The third is through trainee-led pilot projects that leverage the parent project resources and associated multidisciplinary infrastructure. The funded HEAL project, combined with the additional mentoring time provided by the K24, will provide an exceptional POR training and mentoring platform for our large group of current and future K awardees, T32 fellows, and other trainees – and facilitate their transition into independent patient-oriented pain researchers. Project Narrative: Chronic pain has a tremendous impact on the individual and society as a whole. We need clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker signatures to identify those with high-impact chronic pain and determine the trajectory of outcome.

"Neuroimaging-Based Brain and Spinal Cord Biomarkers for Cervical Radiculopathy Chronic pain is a widespread problem that affects a third of Americans and greatly burdens the health care system. Despite its prevalence, chronic pain remains poorly understood, and the current clinical strategies are minimally effective. The application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to the study of chronic pain has significantly increased our understanding of the brain’s role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, and through these studies, researchers have uncovered previously unknown neural processes involved in pain chronification. The spinal cord is the caudal extension of the brainstem and is actively involved in the modulation and transmission of neural signals between the body and the brain. Alterations in the neural processing in the spinal cord are also thought to have an integral role in pain chronification. Recent advancements in spinal cord neuroimaging have made the quantitative study of the spinal cord’s role in chronic pain possible. Expanding the neuroimaging-based investigation of chronic pain to the spinal cord will provide a complete perspective of the central processes underlying pain chronification. In this mentored career development award (K23), Dr. Weber will identify, characterize, and longitudinally track neuroimaging-based biomarkers for chronic pain in the brain and spinal cord using cervical radiculopathy as a model condition for chronic pain. Cervical radiculopathy is a common cause of neck and upper limb pain and provides a unique opportunity to scientifically study chronic pain in a homogenous patient sample. In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Weber will identify differences in the brain and spinal cord networks between patients with chronic pain due to right-sided cervical radiculopathy and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In Aim 3, clinical measures in the same cohort of cervical radiculopathy patients will be longitudinally tracked at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the imaging session, and neuroimaging-based prognostic factors contributing to pain reduction in cervical radiculopathy will be identified. In the same cohort of patients, the imaging will be repeated at 12 months, and the links between the changes in the brain and spinal cord and recovery will be explored. This research will move the pain field forward by further elucidating the neural processes underlying chronic pain and its recovery. Throughout the award period, Dr. Weber will obtain new skills and expertise in conducting clinical studies including randomized controlled trials and applying advanced computational methods to clinical pain research. Additionally, Dr. Weber will gain further training in advanced neuroimaging methods, pain neurobiology, career development, and grant writing. To accomplish the proposed research and training, Dr. Weber has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of world-class mentors who are committed to his success. This training will build on Dr. Weber’s clinical background and doctoral research training in neuroscience and ultimately provide him with the knowledge and skillset to establish an independent research program, in which, he will lead impactful scientific research that intersects neuroimaging and clinical pain research. New advances in medical imaging are uncovering the central nervous system’s role in chronic pain.

"Integrating Pragmatic Comparative Effectiveness Research into a Tertiary Pain Management Center Project Summary: Chronic pain is a major healthcare problem with an annual cost of above $600 billion. The quality of data available for treatments of chronic pain is not optimal. Generalizability of explanatory randomized controlled trial data is problematic as these trials exclude up to 90% of patients: leaving out real-world patients with serious medical and psychological comorbidities. Pragmatic trials embedded in patient care compare effectiveness of currently used treatments in real-world application leading to findings that generalize to broader range of patients. The changes in clinical practice and workflow necessary to integrate this type of research within patient care present pragmatic challenges. In this research, my overall objective is to overcome these challenges using an open-source learning health care system – CHOIR – developed by my mentor at the Stanford Pain Management Center. CHOIR is currently used to track patients’ clinical trajectory and treatment response across multiple academic sites resulting in over 25 publications characterizing chronic pain. Through our pilot studies, we have already developed a point-of-care randomization for CHOIR that facilitates integration of research and patient care by allowing the physicians to randomize patients during clinic visits. We have already demonstrated feasibility of the randomization and data collection platform in two ongoing pilot pragmatic clinical trials. We are proposing to better integrate pragmatic research within our clinical practice through conducting a randomized comparative effectiveness trial in 450 patients with chronic pain comparing effectiveness of anti- convulsants and anti-depressants (two most commonly used classes of medications for treatment of chronic pain). We will use the data available in CHOIR as well as the real-world data generated from this clinical trial to build, validate and test a model to predict what clinical characteristics can predict response to either of these classes of medications. The proposed study is the first step to use flexible point-of-care randomization to compare effectiveness of different treatments in different subgroups of patients whenever equipoise exists. Our prediction model will guide decision making process of clinicians choosing between these medications based on clinical characteristics of individual patients. Dr. Salmasi is a physician-scientist with clinical training in Pain Medicine as well as academic training in Clinical Research and Epidemiology. The detailed career development and research plan presented in this application will provide the required resources and mentorship for him to become an independent R01-funded expert in two domains critical to his long-term career goals: (1) advanced clinical trial design and conduct; and (2) advanced statistics and machine learning.

"PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology (e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2) Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA- 18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision Medicine Initiatives.

"Automatic Multimodal Assessment of Pain in Dementia Project Summary/Abstract Chronic and acute pain conditions increase with aging and with age-associated conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and similar dementias, causing suffering, exacerbating diminished quality of life, and likely leading to further morbidity and increased mortality. Understanding and treatment of pain is particularly challenging among populations whose ability to communicate verbally may be impaired, among which patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are of particular importance if only because of the increased aging population. A substantial body of research suggests that methods based on nonverbal indicators of pain yield reliable and valid measurement of pain in patient with dementias. Some of this work has indicated that patients with dementia may in fact be hyper-reactive to pain, rendering the pursuit of improved techniques for assessing pain in the dementia population even more important. Existing techniques for assessing nonverbal indicators of pain have several disadvantages which limit their utility. In particular, they require human observers, are dependent on specialty training, can be laborious, and cannot be applied on a continuous basis. Advances in computer vision and machine learning have the potential to overcome some of these shortcomings. Our “parent proposal” project aims to develop advanced, automated computer-vision and machine-learning models for assessing nonverbal aspects of pain in a longitudinal cohort study of people with low back pain. This supplement proposal seeks to extend our work on the “parent grant”, which aims to “build a fully automatic, multimodal (face, head, and body movement) system to measure the occurrence and intensity of low back pain from video”. In this supplement project, these aims will be extended to older adults with dementia. We will refine the principles discovered for pain assessment in the low back pain population, extend, and evaluate their application in a sample of older adults with dementias in extended-care facilities. Participants, long-term care residents with dementia, were video-recorded during a baseline state as they were lying still on a bed or examination table and then as they underwent a standardized protocol of movements designed to identify painful areas. Participants' face, head, and body movement will be used for the development of automatic measures of the occurrence and intensity of pain. To do so, face, head, and body movement will be automatically tracked using fully- automatic methods. The tracking results will be used to train end-to-end deep- leaning based classifiers to automatically measure the occurrence and intensity of pain in older adults with dementia. To investigate the validity of the proposed classifiers, we will compare automated measurement of pain intensity to reliable and objective pain intensity coding. MANOVA will be used to quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for the measurement of the occurrence and intensity of pain in older adults with dementia. Project Narrative The present supplement proposal seeks to extend our work on the parent grant to develop automatic multimodal approaches for the measurement of pain intensity in older adults with dementia. The research holds promise to improve patient care, enhance quality of life, and to advance basic understanding of the dementias through improved pain assessment.",Automatic Multimodal Assessment of Pain in Dementia,10288413,R01NR018451,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Backache ', ' Lumbago ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Nonverbal Communication ', ' non-verbal communication ', ' paralinguistic behavior ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' pain assay ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Head Movements ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' parent grant ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' data sharing ', ' Pain intensity ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' pain model ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINR,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,344726,PA-18
"P-QST Project: Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing (P-QST) to Predict Treatment Response for Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis ABSTRACT: Abdominal pain is the primary driver of morbidity in chronic pancreatitis (CP) and affects approximately 90% of patients over the course of their disease with devastating effects on quality of life. Etiology of pain in CP is multi-factorial. Patients with evidence of pancreatic duct obstruction due to stones and/or strictures are offered invasive treatments such as endotherapy or surgical drainage to relieve pain. However, response to invasive treatments is unpredictable, and currently no clinical tool is available to identify patients who will respond to technically successful treatment. The lack of pain response is at least partially due to supraspinal central sensitization (SCS), a phenomenon of neuropathic and neuroplastic remodeling resulting from persistent pain stimuli. Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), an investigative technique of standardized stimulations to test nociception (the neural signaling that encodes noxious stimuli and the downstream experience of pain), is used in other pain conditions to differentiate between patient subgroups to guide treatment. QST has the potential to change the management algorithm of patients with painful CP. Our preliminary data show that pancreatic QST (P-QST) can phenotype patients with CP into three groups: normal pain processing, segmental (T10 dermatome at the pancreas) sensitization, and widespread hyperalgesia (consistent with SCS). In this proposal, we will evaluate the ability of P-QST to predict response to invasive treatment for painful CP, and to develop a predictive model for individualized prediction of treatment response. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Test the predictive capability of pre-treatment P-QST phenotype for pain improvement following invasive treatment for painful CP. Using pre-procedure P-QST, we will phenotype 150 patients undergoing clinically-indicated invasive treatment for painful CP at UPMC and Johns Hopkins University. Our primary outcome will be average pain score measured by Numeric Rating Scale at 6 months post-intervention. Aim 2. Incorporate P-QST with known and suspected patient, disease, and treatment- related factors to create a model for individualized prediction of response to invasive treatment. Using machine learning tools, we will develop a model that optimizes the prediction of probability of response to invasive treatment in individual patients. This will also determine the relative strength of P-QST as an overall predictor of treatment response. Aim 3. Augment the predictive model (Aim 2) with biochemical inflammatory markers to assess the potential to increase predictive capability for pain improvement following invasive treatment for painful CP. The predictive model developed in aim 2 will be further strengthened by incorporating serum neuroinflammatory markers at baseline. Our findings will be a major step toward development of individualized prediction of treatment response following invasive treatment for painful CP. They will lay the foundation for multicenter studies to fully define the role of P-QST in locally invasive and other treatments for pain management for painful CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis (CP) affects approximately 90% of patients and is the primary driver of morbidity, poor quality of life, and health care utilization. Response to currently available therapies is suboptimal and predicting which individuals will respond to invasive treatment has not been possible to date.

"Central glutamate signaling in postoperative pain regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Postoperative pain is a major morbidity, and persistent opioid use after surgery has contributed to an epidemic. An improved mechanistic understanding of how pain is regulated within the brain can lead to novel non-opioid analgesic development. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the central regulation of postoperative pain. The objective of the current application is to define the role of prelimbic cortex (PL) and anterior cingulate cortex(ACC), two key components of the prefrontal cortexin rodents, in the regulation of acute and chronic postoperative pain. The PL is homologous to human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that is known to undergo synaptic changes with chronic pain, and the ACC is a well-described region for processing affective component of pain across species. Our central hypothesis is that an imbalance in neural activities in the PL and ACC contributes to symptoms of postoperative pain and thus forms a therapeutic target. Our hypothesis is supported by the current literature showing that the PL has a pain-inhibitory role, whereas the ACC enhances pain aversion, and that chronic pain causes increased excitability in the ACC and hypo-excitability in the PL. It is also supported by our recent results demonstrating that AMPAkines and ketamine, drugs that alter glutamate signaling and shape cortical circuits, reduce pain. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that an imbalance in ACC and PL activities contributes to postoperative pain in awake freely behaving rats. We will use paw incision (PI) to mimic acute reversible incisional pain, and spared nerve injury (SNI) to model chronic pain after intraoperative nerve damage. We will first correlate imbalanced prefrontal activities with pain, by showing a concurrent loss of nociceptive response in the PL and gain of response in the ACC as pain behavior persists, and the resolution of such neural changes as pain resolves, using simultaneous in vivo extracellular recordings of the PL and ACC. Further, to test the causal effect of this imbalance on pain, we will show that optogenetic PL activation, or ACC inhibition, reverses postoperative pain behaviors. Next, we will use optrode recordings to dissect a local pain- regulatory circuit fromthe PL to the ACC. Further, we will use an unbiased supervised machine learning analysis to validate the relationship between the imbalance in PL and ACC activities and the chronicity of postoperative pain. In Aim 2, We will test the hypothesis that pharmacologic and electrical neuromodulation can target imbalanced PL/ACC activities in the postoperative pain state. We will show that AMPAkines and ketamine increase PL outputs and reduce ACC activities to inhibit pain and optimize the timing and dosing regimens for these drugs and test therapeutic synergy. We will also optimize invasive and non-invasive electrical stimulation protocols in the PL to treat pain. This project is innovative because it applies a new systems neuroscience approach with cutting-edge techniques to uncover a central pain-regulatory mechanism. The work is significant because it produces novel applications of FDA-approved drugs (ketamine and APMAkines) for postoperative pain and a blueprint for new deep brain or transcranial stimulation methods to treat pain. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precise understanding of the central mechanisms for postoperative pain is needed to develop novel analgesics and address the current opioid epidemic. The proposed research tests the hypothesis that an imbalance in neural activities in the prefrontal regions of the brain contributes to symptoms of postoperative pain. Further, we aim to define novel brain stimulation methods that target cortical mechanism for the treatment of postoperative pain in preclinical models, and test FDA-approved drugs such as ketamine and AMPkines as pain therapeutics based on their impact on cortical circuitry.",Central glutamate signaling in postoperative pain regulation,10385965,R01GM115384,"['nonopioid analgesics ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' synergism ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' sensory integration ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Pain Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Affective ', ' Implant ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' therapeutic target ', ' pain inhibition ', ' inhibit pain ', ' nociceptive response ', ' parent grant ', ' FDA approved ', ' pain behavior ', ' Regimen ', ' optogenetics ', ' spared nerve ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' glutamatergic signaling ', ' glutamate signaling ', ' glutamatergic dendrodendritic synapses ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' pain reduction ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain signal ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' nerve damage ', ' Analgesics ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Anodynes ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' pain killer ', ' pain medication ', ' pain reliever ', ' painkiller ', ' Anesthesiology ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equipment ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Ketamine ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"A Stress and Pain Self-management m-Health App for Adult Outpatients with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary/Abstract Our long-term goal is to reduce stress and improve sickle cell disease (SCD) pain control with less opioid use through an intervention with self-management relaxation/distraction exercises (RDE), named You Cope, We Support (YCWS). Americans living with SCD suffer recurrent episodes of acute and chronic pain, both of which are exacerbated by stress. Building on the successes of our prior formative studies, we now propose a well- designed, appropriately powered study to test efficacy of YCWS on outcomes (pain intensity, stress intensity, opioid use) in adults with SCD. We propose to recruit 170 adults for a randomized controlled trial of the short- term (8 weeks) and long-term (6 months) effects of YCWS on outcomes (pain, stress, and opioid use). Stratified on worst pain intensity (<=5; >5), we will randomly assign patients to groups: 85 to Control (Self- monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders), and 85 to Experimental (Self-monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders + use of YCWS [RDE + Support]). We will ask participants to report outcomes daily. During weeks 1-8, we will send system-generated alerts/reminders to both groups via phone call, text, or email to facilitate data entry (both groups) and intervention use support (experimental). If the patient does not enter data after 24 hours, study support staff will contact him/her for data entry trouble-shooting (both groups) and YCWS use (experimental). We will time stamp and track participants' online activities to understand the study context and conduct exit interviews on acceptability of the staff and system-generated support. We will analyze data using mixed-effects regression models (short-term, long-term) to account for repeated measurements over time and utilize machine learning to construct and evaluate models predictive of outcomes. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To determine the short-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in the first 8 weeks, compared to the control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 2: To determine the long-term effects of YCWS. Hypothesis: in months 3-6, compared to control group, the experimental group will report reductions in pain intensity (primary outcome, 0-10 scale) and secondary outcomes--stress intensity (0-10 scale) and opioid use (oral morphine equivalence [OME]). Aim 3 (exploratory): Using machine learning, to develop and evaluate models that predict patient outcomes based on their group assignment and on their personal (e.g., self-efficacy, sex, education, family income, computer experience, etc.,) and environmental characteristics (e.g., distance from care, quality of cell connection, etc.). Findings will guide future studies on the implementation of the m-Health enabled YCWS self-management intervention in the real world by adults with SCD. Findings also will guide the discovery of an ideal delivery method for YCWS, and personal and environmental characteristics of patients who would benefit from YCWS to control effectively the pain of SCD and other types of pain and its psychological impact.

"A Digital Therapeutic for Pain Relief through AI-Guided Visual Stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY Dandelion™ was founded in 2020 to develop digital therapeutics for neurologic and psychiatric disorders by interacting with the brain via the eyes. The goal of this SBIR is to design and test a safe, effective, and non- addictive pain-relief digital therapeutic in the form of visual stimuli. The platform will use artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time biofeedback to “read” (decipher) brain signals and “write” to (neuromodulate) the brain with rapid-changing visual stimuli composed of optimized patterns, colors, and frequencies. This is the first attempt to use AI-guided visual stimuli as a treatment for pain. In 2017, 11 million of the 191 million prescriptions written for opioid pain medications were misused, and 35% of opioid-related deaths (nearly 17,000 cases) were connected to these prescriptions. In the search for safe, effective alternatives, a range of opioid-sparing interventions have been developed through pharmacologic, clinical, and digitized behavioral platforms but none has proved fully successful. Dandelion hypothesizes that the complexity and variability of pain demands a therapeutic approach that mimics the way the brain itself processes and integrates data for pain perception. Through its novel neuromodulatory platform, using artificial intelligence to parameterize potentially useful visual information, Dandelion will develop a safe, low-cost digital therapeutic that patients can view on a smartphone or tablet for immediate pain relief. By correlating stimulus with response across different types of pain, Dandelion also hopes to build a pain-perception map of wider applicability. In Phase I a prototype AI-guided platform will be developed that can synthesize novel stimulation combinations and optimize them based on feedback from an array of biosensors; their efficacy in reducing the perception of induced pain will then be tested in healthy subjects. In Phase II, Dandelion will develop the prototype into a commercially available product and test the pain-relief digital therapeutic for efficacy and generalizability in randomized controlled trials. The commercial opportunity is estimated to be $5.9 billion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dandelion is developing a non-addictive pain treatment that patients can view on their smartphone or tablet for immediate relief.

"Mechanical Biomarkers of Chronic Low Back Pain Abstract The intervertebral disc (IVD) has an essential role in transferring load during normal spine function and when this normal function fails, symptoms, degeneration and altered spine mechanics may occur. The overall scientific premise of this work is that there is a gap in knowledge of the relationship between contributions from mechanical, inflammatory and biopsychosocial factors that lead to chronic low back pain (LBP). An important gap is a poor understanding of the relationship between IVD degeneration and LBP. This lack of understanding leads to discordance between imaging and self-reported pain and, ultimately, treatments being delivered by an exclusionary process. To address this gap, we will use innovative in vivo imaging tools to quantify the mechanical function of the IVD. We will also measure quantitative sensory factors, biochemical markers, and biopsychosocial factors that, when combined with mechanical function, may better identify subgroups or phenotypes of LBP. The overall goal of this project is to identify if mechanical function of the IVD is a potential risk factor and whether mechanical function can assist with defining phenotypes of LBP. The findings from this study would lead to longitudinal analyses to determine whether these phenotypes predict the transition from acute to chronic LBP. The rationale for this proposed research is that: 1) altered mechanical function of the IVD contributes to LBP. 2) LBP is a heterogeneous condition that can result from a combination of mechanical, inflammatory, and central pain based sources. The central hypothesis is that in vivo measured IVD mechanical function will be an important potential risk factor for both acute and chronic non-specific LBP and that this measure will improve the phenotyping of LBP. In Aim I, we will quantify the association between in-vivo measured IVD mechanical function among acute and chronic non-specific LBP participants and asymptomatic controls. In Aim II, we will derive well-defined phenotypes of LBP using combinations of potential risk factors. Identifying phenotypes of LBP will allow for specific rehabilitation, surgical, pharmaceutical or behavioral treatments to be targeted, resulting in improved patient outcomes. Project Narrative Low back pain is a complex and costly public health problem. We will use innovative combinations of in vivo imaging to quantify mechanical function of the intervertebral disc and combine this information with other known risk factors to develop subgroups of patients with low back pain.

"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial

"Cerebral oscillations of pain Summary Chronic pain disorders are amongst the most burdensome of all diseases in terms of their impact on the individual and the costs to society. The development of novel therapeutic approaches for chronic pain have relied on basic studies involving genetic and molecular approaches in rodent models of pain, but existing drugs generally provide very limited relief for only a small number of patients. The result is that a vast number of people with chronic pain go untreated and have only partial relief. There is substantial and growing evidence from within and outside the pain research fields that indicates neural oscillations reflect cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes, which are all components of the pain experience. Furthermore, we can target these oscillatory patterns to alter perception. In particular, alpha band activity has been associated with chronic pain, and our extensive recent work and preliminary findings indicate that alpha can reliably predict future sensitivity to pain experienced minutes to weeks in the future in healthy subjects. In the proposed studies, we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI to continue our ongoing work on alpha oscillations as pain mechanisms and extend it to test the specificity and sensitivity of the signals and the relationship between alpha, brain networks, and pain. The proposed work would lead to improved understanding of the neurobiology of pain, identify novel brain targets for new or improved interventions, and potentially reveal a prognostic biomarker that would be useful for testing new therapeutic approaches and objectively assessing clinical improvement on an individual basis. Narrative Development of treatments for chronic pain has been limited, but the potential for using brain signal predictive and prognostic biomarkers is growing. In the proposed studies we aim to understand the mechanisms of an electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain oscillation that predicts pain sensitivity in healthy subjects. The findings will provide a major step forward in the development of novel therapies for chronic pain and individualized treatment approaches.",Cerebral oscillations of pain,10207807,R01NS112356,"['Affect ', ' Alpha Rhythm ', ' α Rhythm ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' chronic pain ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Painless ', ' non-painful ', ' nonpainful ', ' not painful ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Frequencies ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pain-Free ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pain Research ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Behavioral ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' Persistent pain ', ' constant pain ', ' lasting pain ', ' on-going pain ', ' ongoing pain ', ' analytical tool ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' effective intervention ', ' Pain intensity ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' cognitive task ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' pain model ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' side effect ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' noninvasive brain stimulation ', ' non-invasive brain stimulation ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,403771,MD-07
"Multivariate Machine Learning to Characterize Opioid-induced Alterations in the Brain in Chronic Pain PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prescription opioids are a potent class of drugs for treating pain. However, growing body of research has described iatrogenic consequences of long-term (> 90 days) opioid use in patients with chronic pain including hyperalgesia and impaired executive function. Dopamine is a critical modulator of executive function. While changes in pain and behavior have been noted, little is known about the brain’s morphology, neural and dopaminergic activity that change over time with long-term prescription opioid use. Consistent with the NIDA Strategic Plan objective 1.3, this K25 proposal seeks to “establish the effects of drug use, addiction, and recovery on brain circuits, behavior, and health” using neuroimaging-informed tools. Specifically, the present study combines multiple levels of investigation, including structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and neuropsychological assessments of executive function, and employ machine learning techniques for analysis to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain in chronic pain patients. The applicant will use her advanced quantitative skills in neuroimaging data analysis and modeling to training in QST, and experience in cognitive neuropsychology, epidemiology of chronic pain and addiction to develop an independent research plan in translational pain and successfully compete for future R01 funding. To achieve the training needed to facilitate this investigation, the applicant has consulted with an expert in chronic pain research and opioid therapy, a substance abuse specialist, a neuropsychologist, an epidemiologist, an imaging scientist, and a machine learning leader in neuroimaging field to develop an innovative study and training plan. 40 patients with a diagnostically homogeneous chronic pain condition (i.e., chronic low back pain; CLBP) on long-term opioid therapy, as compared to 40 opioid-naïve CLBP patients, will be studied to achieve the following Aims: 1) Measure pain, cognitive performance, neural and dopaminergic activity during concurrent pain and executive function task fMRI-PET to characterize the effects of opioids on pain processing and executive function in CLBP; 2) measure intrinsic brain activity during resting state fMRI-PET to identify intrinsic brain alterations associated with long-term opioid use in CLBP; and 3) apply high-resolution structural MRI to measure opioid-induced morphological changes in CLBP. This research is innovative in its use of combined QST and neuro- psychological measures with multimodal imaging and sophisticated statistical approaches. It is significant because of its comprehensive approach towards addressing the NIDA Strategic Plan objective. Findings stand to inform medical decision-making regarding pain care and opioid prescription, as well as risk mitigation strategies. The research, training and results obtained will provide a platform for applicant’s long-term scientific research goal of becoming an independent R01-funded, faculty-level principal investigator performing translational pain research aimed at developing neuroimaging tools to have clinical application. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE Inquiry into the effects of long-term prescription opioid use in patients with chronic pain are highly relevant and timely due to the increased epidemic of prescription opioid use in the US. Using quantitative sensory testing, neuropsychological assessments, multimodal neuroimaging and advanced statistical techniques for data analysis, the proposed study seeks to identify the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain and their relation to clinical symptoms. By detecting changes at behavioral, molecular and neural systems levels, this study will be pivotal in the development of effective pain management strategies in chronic pain, and training of Dr.

"Technology Research Site for Advanced, Faster Quantitative Imaging for BACPAC PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disorders of the spine have a tremendous impact on society; both physically through the morbidity of afflicted individuals, and financially, through lost productivity and increased health care costs. Despite the significance of this problem, the etiology of symptoms is diverse and unclear in many patients, and there are few reliable methods by which to prospectively determine the appropriate course of patient care and to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions. Challenges contributing to this major healthcare dilemma include numerous sources of back pain, difficulty in visualization of responsible tissues using any single imaging technique and difficulty in the localization of pain and contributing molecular processes. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MR) has been used to characterize disc, muscle, nerves and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has been used to study bone turnover, and facet disease in subjects with lower back pain.  The research and tool development proposed in this UH2/UH3 takes the critical next step in the clinical translation of faster, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of patients with lower back pain. New optimized techniques and patient studies are required to investigate its clinical potential for quantitatively characterizing the tissues implicated in lower back pain, and objective evaluation of pain. Our proposed multidisciplinary Technology Research Site (Tech Site) of the NIH Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) will develop Phase IV TTMs (Research and Development for Technology Optimization) to leverage two key technical advancements – development of machine learning based faster MR acquisition methods, and machine learning for image segmentation and extraction of objective disease related features from images. We will develop, validate, and deploy end-to-end deep learning-based technologies (TTMs) for accelerated image reconstruction, tissue segmentation, detection of spinal degeneration, to facilitate automated, robust assessment of structure-function relationships between spine characteristics, neurocognitive pain response, and patient reported outcomes. To accomplish this important project, we have assembled a highly-experienced multidisciplinary research team combining extensive expertise MR bioengineering, advanced MRI data analysis, radiology, neuroscience, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, multi-dimensional analytics and have existing research agreements with industry. The research facilities and environment include the clinical and research infrastructure required for successful completion of the proposed translational project. The team has disseminated tools before to academia, worked closely with industry and are motivated to totally work with BACPAC as the plans of the consortium evolve. PROJECT NARRATIVE The successful outcome of the proposed project will result in the development and translation into the clinical setting of new methods to enable greatly improved imaging of lower back pain in human subjects. While this project focuses on lower back pain, these new imaging techniques could ultimately benefit the clinical management of other musculoskeletal pain.","Technology Research Site for Advanced,

"Technologies for OUD Prevention, Control and Supportive Care - Development of Patient/Caregiver mobile application and Provider Dashboard ABSTRACT Pain is an important issue for both society and health care. The increasing frequency of individuals with chronic pain as the result of chronic diseases and postoperative pain have directly led, over the past two decades, to the over-prescription and misuse of opioids. In early 2019, an estimated 130 people per day were dying from opioid- related drug overdoses, 2 million people were misusing first-time opioid prescriptions, and almost 33000 deaths were attributed to overdosing with synthetic non-methadone opioids in the USA alone. Even though respiratory depression and complete respiratory arrest are the major causes of mortality with opioid overdose, there is currently a serious knowledge gap in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of opioid pain relief and respiratory depression by opioids, and how these mechanisms differ from each other. Aidar Health’s ground- breaking technology offers a rapid medical assessment device, MouthLab, which non-invasively measures 10+ vital medical parameters in under 60 seconds, and an enterprise platform that leverages data science, to create a new kind of precision medicine through clinical-grade monitoring, at home. A point-of-care solution such as MouthLab is fundamental in understanding the impact of prescribed opioids and synthetic drugs, its impact on the underlying chronic condition and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Powered by AI and machine learning, Aidar’s proprietary software would be able to provide deeper, real-time insights of subtle changes in physiology to assist the provider with decisions related to drug titration, treatment changes, adjunct therapies before any adverse event can occur. MouthLab’s ability to combine a wide-ranging spectrum of cardiopulmonary measurements (i.e. SpO2, Heart rate, Heart rate variability, Respiratory Rate, Respiratory Flow Cycle Morphology, Spirometry), would be able to solve the problem of lack of real-time health insights which would have significant relevance to providers in the treatment development process through the collection of multiple biomarker data linked to opioid-induced respiratory depression. This product creates a fundamental shift in the technology employed at home by identifying early warning symptoms through a multiparameter approach and facilitates understanding of the underlying mechanisms linking pain relief with control of breathing to identify pain therapies with minimal or no respiratory side effects. The novelty is affirmed with two approved patents and the freedom to operate analysis that found no prior art of concern. The goal of this project is to develop software infrastructure that would enhance the progressive and holistic monitoring of users experiencing OUD. By the end of this award, the company will test and validate the newly developed software capabilities in a small cohort of patients and controls at TentHouse Health & Wellness. Our solution has a validated business model (through over 100 consumers at Johns Hopkins Hospital and with 6 Pharmaceutical customer interviews) that drive value for patients, physicians, biopharmaceuticals, and payers. A successful development of this product is forecast to create 43 new jobs (2022) with an annual payroll exceeding $11.5M. As a direct result of this award, this innovative product can reach the U.S. market in 2022, with $123M in projected revenue by 2025. Our mission is to empower the uses and improve the quality of life of every individual with OUD. MouthLab will essentially be like a ‘Check Engine’ light for individual with OUD. NARRATIVE Pain is an important issue for both society and healthcare. In the USA, the annual burden on society has been estimated at $560-$635 billion. The increasing frequency of individuals with chronic pain as the result of chronic diseases and postoperative pain have directly led, over the past two decades, to the over prescription and misuse of opioids. Using Aidar’s rapid health assessment device, MouthLab, we aim to measure 10+ vital health parameters and by developing unique software capabilities we offer providers and caregivers the access to user- level data and key health insights, in real-time, for early detection of health deterioration and timely intervention at home. By removing the barriers to clinical care and research, we are in parallel capturing the largest digital dataset on human health and disease, which will transform our understanding of health,

"Automated Physiological Assessment of Chronic Pain in Daily Life The United States is in the midst of dual epidemics of chronic pain and opioid abuse, with approx. 20% of the population in persistent pain, and over 40,000 lives lost each year to opioid misuse. Chronic back pain (CBP) is the most common pain disorder and one of the major reasons for prescribing opioids. Strategies to help reduce CBP pain without opioids are therefore urgent. A promising opioid alternative are psychological interventions that reduce pain intensity, interference and negative emotions, and do not just target the physical pain intensity as many of the traditional pharmacological approaches do. However, these interventions are not often temporally aligned with pain episodes.  We propose to establish diagnostic physiological markers of ongoing clinical pain by capturing ongoing clinical pain and the associated physiological fluctuations and psychological processes. We will develop fully automated real-time detection of ongoing pain in N=80 CBP patients from physiological signs collected in everyday life. We will record multiple physiological signals (electroencephalogram (EEG), facial electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and heart rate (HR)) from two wearable device, one worn around the ears (Earable) and one worn around the wrist (Empatica). The sensing system will be integrated with an experience sampling method (ESM) smartphone app to collect ratings of pain and psychological processes associated with pain episodes. Our goal in Aim 1 is to establish computational physiology-based models that can predict clinical pain in real-life. To achieve this, we will apply machine-learning techniques to physiological data preceding pain self-reports to build predictive models of ongoing pain, with the ultimate goal for these computational models to be able to trigger psychological interventions when needed most, which we aim to develop in our future research. Our goal in Aim 2 is to field-test these computational models in a new group of N=20 CBP patients.  The proposed work will afford, for the first time, autonomous monitoring of clinical pain in real-life. If the real-life pain experience of patients can be captured in physiological patterns preceding pain, then automated tracking of physiology has considerable potential to improve the efficacy of psychological treatments, by providing signals to trigger just-in-time interventions. Overall, the proposed project will contribute fundamental scientific knowledge about psycho-physiological signs of real-life pain and lay the groundwork for translational efforts to improve outcomes of pain self-management and reduce opioid use. The United States is in the midst of dual epidemics of chronic pain and opioid abuse and treatments to reduce pain without opioids are therefore crucial and urgent - psychological treatments have shown potential but also limited efficacy thus far. In this proposal, we will record multiple physiological and psychological signs of pain to develop computational models of real-life fluctuations in chronic pain levels. The findings of this proposal will translate into psychological interventions better matched to psycho-physiological signs of clinical pain and will deepen our understanding of the multidimensional nature of chronic pain.",Automated Physiological Assessment of Chronic Pain in Daily Life,10219003,R21NR018972,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Ear ', ' Electromyography ', ' Electrooculography ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pain Disorder ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Electrooculogram ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Persistent pain ', ' constant pain ', ' lasting pain ', ' on-going pain ', ' ongoing pain ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' chronic back pain ', ' prescription opioid ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' Pain intensity ', ' clinical predictors ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' pain self-management ', ' pain reduction ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain patient ', ' clinical pain ', ' opioid misuse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R21,2021,230311,CO-02
