"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,10223179,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Hardware ', ' computer system hardware ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Peptides ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Chimp ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Pan Species ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Endocrine ', ' Nuclear ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' Peptide Hormone Gene ', ' peptide hormone ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' drug development ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Proteomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' genome annotation ', ' screening ', ' dark matter ', ' terabyte ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2021,1186500,MA-07
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry. This new technology will contribute to understanding complex processes in biological tissues that play a role in both health and disease.",Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry,10441650,UH3CA255132,"['Automation ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Glass ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Ions ', ' Lipids ', ' Maps ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Oligosaccharides ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Peptides ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Solvents ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Label ', ' Microscope ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' ESI Mass Spectrometry ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Electrospray Ionization ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' nano ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' ionization technique ', ' ionization method ', ' mass spectrometer ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoprobe ', ' nano probe ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' biological systems ', ' operation ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging platform ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' preservation ', ' automated analysis ', ' Human BioMolecular Atlas Program ', ' HuBMAP ', ' lipidomics ', ' ']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2021,76212,IN-04
"Compute-Cluster for Deep-Learning Models for Mass Spectrometry based Proteomics data Project Abstract/Summary Mass spectrometry (MS) data is high-dimensional data that is used for large-scale system biology proteomics. The current state of the art mass spectrometers can generate thousands of spectra from a single organism and experiment. This high-dimensional data is processed using database searches and denovo algorithms with varying degrees of success. The overarching objective of this study is to develop, test, integrate and evaluate novel image-processing and deep-learning algorithms that will allow us to deduce and identify reliable peptide sequences in a definitive and quantitative fashion. Our long-term goal is to improve on identification of MS based proteomics data using novel and scalable algorithms. The objective of this proposal is to investigate, design and implement machine-learning deep-learning algorithms for identification of peptides from MS data. Since deep-learning is very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data it will be ideal solution for discovering dark proteomics data and more accurate deduction of peptides. We predict that the integration of these methods, along with traditional numerical algorithms, will lead to a multimodal fusion-based approach for an optimized and accurate peptide deduction system for large-scale MS data. Further, we will design and implement data augmentation, memory-efficient indexing, and high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve these outcomes more efficiently with a shorter computational time. Therefore, this new line of investigation is significant since it has the potential to improve on long-stalled effort to increase accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of MS data analysis and search tools. The proximate expected outcome of this work is a novel set of deep-learning and image-processing tools which will allow much better insight in MS based proteomics data. The results will have an important positive impact immediately because these proposed research tasks will lay the groundwork to develop a new class of algorithms and will provide rapid, high-throughput, sensitive, and reproducible and reliable tools for MS based proteomics. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics can allow systematic analysis of thousands of proteins with the promise of discovering new protein biomarkers for different disease conditions and better understanding of human systems biology. Because of high-dimensionality of the big data generated from MS machines efficient, accurate and reproducible tools are required to mine and analyze the data and is the subject of this proposal. Such high-performance tools will be instrumental in elucidating the microbiome which affects virtually all aspects of human health.

"Development of a commercially viable machine learning product to automatically detect rotator cuff muscle pathology PROJECT SUMMARY Rotator cuff tears are highly problematic for large patient populations, and therefore remain a very challenging clinical problem. Roughly 20% to 50% of those 60 years of age have a known rotator cuff tear and the prevalence only increases with age. While surgical reconstruction of the rotator cuff seeks to improve shoulder function and stability, the degrees of successful surgical outcomes vary significantly. These widely differing outcomes are because, pre-operatively, it is difficult under current evaluative methods to predict which patients will benefit from surgery versus those who will not. The focus of this project is to develop unique technology that replaces current methods to produce a rapid, accurate assessment of rotator cuffs capable of large-scale commercial deployment. From a clinical perspective, there is significant scientific evidence that excessive fat infiltration and atrophy of the rotator cuff muscles lead to poor outcomes because the presence of fatty tissue limits the ability for the muscle to recover and regenerate following tendon reconstruction. While current clinical practice utilizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate fat infiltration in the rotator cuff using qualitative scoring systems, previous studies have established that qualitative scoring has a relatively low correlation with quantitative measures of fat infiltration and atrophy. Incorporating quantitative measurements would dramatically improve clinical treatment decision-making. However, such evaluation under existing methods would require substantial manual input and thus is not clinically viable. A fast and accurate method for segmenting the rotator cuff muscles and quantifying fat infiltration is essential for improving outcomes and reducing unnecessary surgeries. This proposal aims to leverage Springbok’s previous technological innovations in machine learning image segmentation to develop an algorithm capable of fast, accurate assessment of rotator cuff muscle atrophy quantification and fat infiltration. The algorithm will be developed so that it can ultimately be seamlessly integrated into the current clinical workflow, thereby not requiring any additional clinician time, and in fact is likely to materially reduce that time. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep-learning-based automatic algorithm for quantification of rotator cuff muscle volumes and fatty infiltration. In Aim 2, we will develop a software prototype to incorporate the algorithm into clinical workflow to support the decision-making process. Completion of this Phase 1 project will lead to a prototype product that is ready for beta-testing during Phase II at multiple Orthopaedic centers, enabling a 510(k) application for market clearance. This project will significantly improve the accuracy of shoulder pathology assessments, thus advancing the diagnosis and treatment of shoulder pathologies, improving the outcomes of costly Orthopaedic procedures, and potentially even eliminating unnecessary procedures, all of which will improve patient care and lower the associated costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rotator cuff tears are highly problematic for large patient populations such that clinicians need innovative tools to better determine who could benefit from surgical repair. This project will result in revolutionary technology capable of fast, precise measures of muscle atrophy and fat infiltration for accurate pre-intervention evaluation.",Development of a commercially viable machine learning product to automatically detect rotator cuff muscle pathology,10268004,R41AR078720,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Client ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Shoulder ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' radiologist ', ' Infiltration ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Unnecessary Surgery ', ' Unnecessary Procedures ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Orthopedic Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Supraspinatus ', ' supraspinatus muscle ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' technological innovation ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Collection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Slice ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' reconstruction ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' rotator cuff tear ', ' improved outcome ', ' cost outcomes ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' DICOM ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,"SPRINGBOK, INC.",R41,2021,208204,VA-05
"Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies ABSTRACT: Endometriosis is a chronic pathologic condition that affects approximately 176 million worldwide, and can cause severe abdominal pain and subfertility. Despite its prevalence, there is currently no widely accepted theory of pathogenesis for endometriosis. Further, there are currently no clinical biomarkers for non- invasive diagnosis as most patients are only diagnosed at the time of exploratory laparoscopy. Thus, application of new molecular technologies to advance the understanding, diagnosis, and intraoperative detection of endometriosis is critically needed to improve patient care and management. Ambient mass spectrometry (MS) techniques offer the chemical specificity and sensitivity to perform rapid and in-depth molecular analysis of unprocessed tissue samples. We propose to conduct a rigorous study applying MS techniques in conjunction with statistical methods to identify, characterize, and validate metabolic and protein markers of endometrial and endometriosis tissues correlated to patient symptoms and disease presentation. Further, we propose to evaluate the performance of ambient MS techniques as tools for rapid diagnosis of endometrial tissues, and in vivo intraoperative disease detection. Combining our team’s expertise in MS, statistics, gynecological surgery, pathology and endometriosis, we are unique poised to successfully carry out the following proposed aims: Aim 1. Characterize metabolic and proteomic markers of endometriosis tissues from endometriosis patients using MS imaging. Characterization of molecular markers that are specific to endometriosis lesions within tissue microenvironment can lead to new understanding of the biological mechanisms governing endometriosis development and pinpoint potential targets for treatment. Using a large cohort of tissues prospectively collected from surgeries, we will use MS imaging and statistical analysis to identify molecular signatures of endometriosis tissues and uncover significant molecular alterations correlated to patient phenotypes and disease presentation within controlled patient subgroups. Aim 2. Define diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissues from endometriosis and unaffected patients. New methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis endometriosis are critically needed to advance patient care. We propose to use MS imaging and statistical analyses to identify diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissue samples obtained from eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients, and endometrium tissues from unaffected patients undergoing other benign gynecological procedures, with the goal of identifying molecular markers that could use for diagnosis of endometriosis from tissue biopsies. Aim 3. Test the MasSpec Pen as an intraoperative tool for in vivo endometriosis detection. Complete excision of endometriosis lesions and preservation of healthy adjacent tissues is of utmost importance in the surgical treatment of patients. We propose to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the performance of MasSpec Pen technology for in vivo detection of endometriosis lesions and surgical guidance in laparoscopic procedures. Narrative  We propose to develop and use mass spectrometry technologies in conjunction with statistical methods to better understand, detect, and diagnose endometriosis. By leveraging the advantages of the chemical sensitivity and specificity of mass spectrometry with the simplicity, speed, and spatial correlation offered by ambient mass spectrometry techniques, we aim to develop new methods that can improve the diagnosis and management of endometriosis at multiple stages of patient treatment using a large cohort of patient samples. The experiments proposed will explore the molecular differences between eutopic and ectopic endometrium tissues, correlate molecular data with patient phenotypes and disease presentation, advance development of a diagnostic method for endometriosis, and improve the surgical resection of endometriosis lesions in vivo during surgical procedures, leading to new understanding of this disease and offering improved treatment options for patients.",Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies,10219741,R01HD101560,"['Abdominal Pain ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biopsy ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' endometriosis ', ' Endometrium ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patient Care Management ', ' Patients ', ' Laparoscopy ', ' Celioscopy ', ' Diagnostic Laparoscopy ', ' Peritoneoscopy ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Robotics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' statistics ', ' Gynecologic Surgical Procedures ', ' Gynecologic Surgery ', ' Gynecological Surgery ', ' Gynecological Surgical Procedure ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Benign ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Endometrial ', ' insight ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' ESI Mass Spectrometry ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization ', ' ionization ', ' Performance ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' reproductive ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Proteomics ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Molecular Diagnosis ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Electrospray Ionization ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' minimally invasive ', ' treatment strategy ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' eutopic endometrium ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' predictive signature ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' in situ imaging ', ' preservation ', ' subfertility ', ' primary infertility ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,1,TX-10

"2022 Chemistry & Biology of Peptides Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Summary/Abstract The 2022 Chemistry and Biology of Peptides Gordon Research Conference (CBP-GRC) will highlight the exciting diversity of peptide science. Attendees will engage in discussions regarding scientific discoveries, challenges and advances in the design, synthesis, characterization, and translation of peptides. We have created an innovative and cutting-edge program encompassing sessions focusing on recent developments in chemical biology and organic synthesis complemented with sessions covering topics such as artificial intelligence (AI), vaccine development, immunology, natural and unnatural products, advances in green chemistry, biosynthesis, and novel technologies. To engage the audience and promote discussion, session chairs will give an overview of the broader field in each session to bring the audience together before the session speakers deliver their lectures. Furthermore, to increase cross-talk amongst scientists, sessions including “peptide mash-up” and the “future of peptides” will bring together scientists from vastly different fields (e.g. green chemistry, drug discovery, and structural biology) in a single session encouraging and stimulating our attendees to think outside of their own scientific boxes and promote collaboration across multiple disciplines. In 2022, the successful and well attended Power Hour will continue, highlighting the challenges women and minorities are still facing, as well as discussing solutions and progress toward equity. Altogether, this conference provides a collegial environment where emerging scientists present their work alongside world leaders in the field and the conference is the highlight of the peptide community conference calendar. The graduate and postdoctoral student-run Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), held in conjunction with the related GRC, will provide opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to foster meaningful connections by discussing their research and networking with their peers. The student- facilitated seminar, as well as the poster session, are designed to foster communication between students and form relationships which are then leveraged at the GRC. In addition, the GRS includes a career panel in which three mid-to-late career professionals provide insights and strategies on various career paths. The objective of the CBP-GRC is to provide opportunities to deepen the impact of peptide science on healthcare and technology through scientific communication and collaboration while actively prioritizing a diversified community and the involvement of underrepresented minorities.

"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention.

"Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis Project Summary After nearly five decades of human voice research, much remains unknown regarding muscle control mechanism of voice production. Studies confirmed that vocal fold pre-phonatory posture (geometry, position, tension and stiffness) is among the primary factors controlling vocal fold vibratory dynamics and voice type. However, very limited data is available on muscle control of these properties, primarily due to experimental difficulties. Muscle control of glottic geometry and dynamics has been studied in in vivo human and animal models, but these studies were limited to an endoscopic superior view, thus cannot to provide 3D deformation/movement of the vocal folds. Moreover, tension and stiffness of the vocal fold tissues are very difficult to obtain in vivo due to a lack of reliable techniques. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding how intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILMs) control voice production through vocal fold posturing as well as how ILM dysfunctions, such as vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP), affect voice production by altering vocal fold posturing. In this project, we propose to use an innovative approach that integrates experimental data and state-of-the-art computer modeling techniques to produce a complete dataset of 3D vocal fold postures (geometry, position, tension, stiffness), 3D vocal fold vibratory dynamics, and voice outcomes in the full muscle control space including symmetric, asymmetric and compensative muscle activations. The PI’s group recently developed a state-of-the-art, physics based, 3D computer model that integrates realistic laryngeal anatomy, physiologically quantifiable inputs, inverse material parameterization and machine learning for simulating vocal fold posturing and flow-structure-acoustics interaction (FSAI) during voice production. For this project, we propose to combine this embodied model with experimental data to generate a holistic view of vocal fold posturing and FSAI with great temporal and spatial details in the full muscle control space. In particular, the model will reveal the 3D complexity of vocal fold postures and vibrations and provide measures of tension and stiffness with muscle activations, which have not been available. We propose to use the dataset to elucidate causal links among muscle activity, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice outcome. Muscle combinations with distinct posturing, vibration and acoustic patterns will be identified. The new knowledge is expected to elucidate the muscle control mechanism of voice production through vocal fold posturing. The proposed work has the potential to improve insight into the function and dysfunction of the ILMs and to serve as a foundation for novel, targeted therapeutic approaches. We hope to develop possible biomechanical metrics for the diagnosis and optimal methodology for treatment of VFP. Project Narrative Vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP) is the most common etiology of voice disorders which affects 9% of the U.S. population. Diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP remain challenging because of incomplete understanding of muscle control mechanism of vocal fold posturing and vibration. This project will build causal links among muscle activation, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice acoustics, allowing for the development of possible biomechanical metrics for diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP.",Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis,10299679,R15DC019229,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Foundations ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Larynx ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' voice box ', ' Methodology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Otolaryngology ', ' otorhinolaryngology ', ' Paresis ', ' Muscle Paresis ', ' Muscular Paresis ', ' paretic ', ' paretic muscle ', ' Physics ', ' Posture ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' vocal cord ', ' Vocal Fold ', ' Voice ', ' Voice Disorders ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' insight ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vibration ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' professor ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' in vivo ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Geometry ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MAINE ORONO,R15,2021,431951,ME-02
"Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field Project Summary Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly, is of increasing relevance in the United States due to its aging population. It is generally agreed that the weakening of the muscle in sarcopenia cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass alone, but the mechanisms behind this remain poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of non-invasive techniques for observing muscle structure and composition in high detail. We propose to develop MRI techniques to measure muscle morphology, microstructure, and fat content to get a detailed view of the changes in muscle quantity and quality in patients with sarcopenia and how they relate to more easily attainable measurements of muscle function such as grip strength and gait speed. This would provide an important contribution to the ongoing debate about how such measurements could be used to define sarcopenia, which would pave the way for treatment development. We aim to develop novel methods to investigate the structure and composition of muscle using ultra-high-field MRI. Specifically, we aim to (1) obtain water-based images of skeletal muscle macro- and microstructure with unparalleled efficiency, image quality, and resolution; (2) obtain images of the spatial distribution of intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, measuring both methyl and methylene to estimate saturation; and (3) to conduct a study comparing skeletal muscle structure and quality by looking at MR measurements of T2 relaxation rates, diffusivity (as proxies for inflammation and fiber size, respectively), fat fraction, and lipid composition, in subjects with sarcopenia and healthy controls and see how these quantities correlate to muscle function. This project has several innovative aspects. First, we will develop a method to estimate muscle morphology, T2 relaxation rates, and diffusivity with a single MRI sequence. Importantly, this will make the developed method easy to run at other MRI sites. Second, we will devise methods to perform robust, efficient imaging of intramyocellular lipid droplet distribution and saturation in human skeletal muscle in vivo at high field. Both of these methods will have unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio and robustness against image artifacts. The significance of this work is the investigation of the role of inflammation, fiber size, and lipid distribution in the weakening of muscle in sarcopenia and how these measurements are related to muscle function. The resulting conclusions and techniques may help establish a common standard for the definition of sarcopenia and aid in the development of future treatments for this condition. Project Narrative Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function with age, is a condition bound to increase in prevalence with an aging population. The muscle changes involved include not only reduction in mass but also changes in muscle quality not easily visualized with current methods. This work aims to develop efficient MRI techniques to investigate these changes in better detail, improving scientific understanding of the mechanisms of sarcopenia and how they relate to muscle function.",Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field,10125507,K99AG066815,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Awareness ', ' Communities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Lipids ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' carbene ', ' methylene ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' falls ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' bone imaging ', ' bone scanning ', ' skeletal imaging ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Fiber ', ' Muscle function ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Measurement ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Soleus Muscle ', ' Soleus ', ' Hand Strength ', ' Grip strength ', ' Metabolic ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' muscle strength ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' muscular structure ', ' muscle structure ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' Gait speed ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,114480,MA-08
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state.

"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community.

"Bruker RapifleX MALDI TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometer Project Summary/Abstract This proposal requests funding for a Bruker rapifleX matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of- flight/time-of-flight (TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) instrument to be placed in the MS Facility in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). The rapifleX will replace a 2008 Bruker Ultraflex III MALDI TOF/TOF for high resolution and MS/MS analysis of biomacromolecules. This is an essential capability for the user community of NIH-funded chemical biology researchers at UPenn synthesizing modified peptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides. The rapifleX is not merely a replacement for the UltrafleX III, its improved resolution and MS/MS capabilities will permit analysis of complex PTMs or cross-links that are challenging on current MALDI and electrospray ionization systems at UPenn. Furthermore, the rapifleX provides new capabilities not currently found in any MS system at UPenn, allowing users to conceive of new areas of research. Ultra-high throughput screening (uHTS) analysis and MALDI MS imaging (MSI) will take biomedical research at UPenn in new directions. The uHTS capabilities will enable experiments to characterize enzyme and small molecule reactions, including monitoring the kinetics of post-translational modifications on authentic peptide and protein substrates and machine-learning enhanced experiments exploring combinatorial effects of reagents and additives in reactions (in collaboration with the High Throughput Experimentation Center and Merck developers of uHTS experiments). Most significantly, the rapifleX will bring the exciting capability of MSI to UPenn. Among the projects included in this application are those that use state-of-the-art imaging methods with the rapifleX to address important research questions in areas such as cancer, viral and bacterial infections, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease, or diabetes and obesity. Also included is a project that pushes beyond the state-of-the-art to develop new MSI technologies using the rapifleX that will vastly increase the information content from targeted imaging. The addition of the rapifleX will have an immediate and lasting impact on more than 20 highly active investigators and more than 200 trainees carrying out research that spans nine institutes of the NIH. This includes chemical biology, biophysics, organic chemistry, neuroscience, and translational research programs, as well as NIH T32-funded trainees. The rapifleX will also significantly benefit NIH-funded research programs in schools across UPenn, including the Perelman School of Medicine, School of Engineering and Applied Science, and School of Veterinary Medicine, as well as at neighboring institutions such as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Drexel University, and Thomas Jefferson University. The rapifleX will be a key instrument in a broad overhaul of the UPenn Chemistry MS Facility, making it a center of excellence for the region. Narrative A proposed mass spectrometry (MS) instrument will add new, state-of-the-art capabilities, such as MS imaging of biological tissues, to the MS Facility in the Chemistry Department at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). More than 20 faculty research groups (encompassing more than 200 researchers) in the Chemistry Department, in other UPenn departments, and at neighboring institutions, will benefit from access to this instrument, leading to MS-enabled breakthroughs in NIH-funded projects of relevance to cancer, viral and bacterial infections, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, and obesity, among other disorders.",Bruker RapifleX MALDI TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometer,10177330,S10OD030460,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chemistry ', ' Organic Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Engineering ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Institutes ', ' Kinetics ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' oligos ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Peptides ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Veterinary Schools ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chemicals ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization ', ' MALD-MS ', ' MALDI ', ' MALDI-MS ', ' Spectroscopy, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization ', ' matrix assisted laser desorption ionization ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Institution ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Electrospray Ionization ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' mass spectrometer ', ' Imaging technology ', ' combinatorial ', ' targeted imaging ', ' biomacromolecule ', ' biomacromolecular ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' translational research program ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,S10,2021,881298,PA-03
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Platelet mass microarchitecture as a regulator of thrombin production Project summary Thrombin is a critical element of the hemostatic/thrombotic response, as evidenced by the large number of clinically relevant pro- and anti-coagulant therapies designed to regulate its generation or activity. Thrombin regulation is not a purely biochemical matter, but rather it emerges from the interaction of the biochemical cascade with the evolving physical microenvironment (i.e., platelet deposition). As such, in order to determine how reaction rates of the coagulation cascade may be impacted inside of a hemostatic (or thrombotic) mass we need to study the tightly-woven interaction between the biochemical reactions responsible for thrombin generation and the physical environment in which they occur. Our primary objective is to answer a fundamental question: can the narrow pores of a hemostatic mass operate as a ‘molecular barrier’ and terminate thrombin generation? If so, this would represent an understudied mechanism mediated by platelets and/or fibrin, and the structure they form following accumulation, at a site of injury. The hypothesized molecular barrier results from the hindered movement of soluble species through the evolving hemostatic mass microenvironment. Hemostatic masses are defined by a complex network of mesoscopic scale pores with dimensions of a few to tens of nanometers, and as a result, biochemical reactions relevant to clotting occur in extremely confined spaces. Previous studies explored the idea that the physical environment of a hemostatic plug may contribute to regulating the hemostatic response, but an accurate knowledge of the microstructure of a hemostatic mass remains elusive. Our proposed studies will address this bottleneck by combining novel volume imaging electron microscopy methods of hemostatic masses with artificial intelligence methods to create anatomically realistic domains for simulations of coagulation biochemistry. In Aim #1, in collaboration with Dr. Weisel (letter attached), we will acquire sequential image stacks of hemostatic masses formed in vivo using correlative multi-photon fluorescence and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron microscopy. In Aim #2, we employ artificial intelligence methods to perform accurate image-driven 3D reconstruction of hemostatic mass microarchitectures, using the image stacks generated in Aim #1. As part of a related research project, we have already acquired an initial set of transmission electron microscopy images of hemostatic thrombi at single-platelet resolution to guide our initial computational efforts. In Aim #3, we will use the reconstructions obtained to examine how the hemostatic mass microarchitecture impedes molecular transport. We will evolve simulations to systematically evaluate how pore size and molecule size interact to regulate molecular diffusion. Finally, we will ask whether limitations in molecular transport through the hemostatic mass are responsible for the termination of thrombin production at a local level. If confirmed, this mechanism will represent a fundamental shift in the way we understand the role of platelet activation and accumulation, the hallmarks of hemostasis and thrombosis. Project Narrative The coagulation biochemical cascade and platelets work together as part of the normal response to vascular injury, called hemostasis, producing a plug that limits blood loss. By contrast, an improper hemostatic response results in numerous clinical problems, including excessive bleeding (e.g., hemophilia), or vascular occlusion that damages tissues such as the heart and brain (i.e., heart attacks and strokes). The goal of this project is to understand if the biochemical reactions of the coagulation cascade are regulated by the architecture of the hemostatic plug, and then translate that understanding into improved methods to treat disorders of the hemostatic system.",Platelet mass microarchitecture as a regulator of thrombin production,10218337,R21HL153946,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor ', ' Coagulation Factors ', ' clotting factor ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Coagulants ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Design ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Fibrin ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Hemophilia A ', ' Factor VIII Deficiency ', ' Hemophilia ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Ions ', ' Structure of jugular vein ', ' Jugular Veins ', ' Kinetics ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Scanning Electron Microscopy ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Platelet Activation ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombin ', ' Thrombase ', ' fibrinogenase ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Thrombus ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' nano meter ', ' nanometer ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Physical environment ', ' particle ', ' success ', ' Hemostatic Disorders ', ' Confined Spaces ', ' Transmission Electron Microscopy ', ' Structure ', ' chemical reaction rate ', ' reaction rate ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Transport Process ', ' Molecular Transport ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' multi-photon ', ' reconstruction ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' Geometry ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' nanometer resolution ', ' vascular injury ', ' injury to the vasculature ', ' thrombotic ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2021,236604,PA-03
"Role of extracellular matrix in age-related declines of muscle regeneration PROJECT SUMMARY  The capacity for muscle regeneration decreases markedly with aging. While regeneration is led by muscle stem cells (MuSC), complex age-related changes in the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) provide potent signals that drive aberrant lineage specification. The complexity of the interactions between aging MuSC and their environmental niche defined by biomechanical, architectural, and dynamic changes in the ECM suggests a data-driven analysis can elucidate underlying mechanisms, increase our fundamental understanding of aging and stem cell biology, and point to novel therapeutic strategies. In this research, -omics data (i.e., single cell RNA-seq and imaging flow cytometry assessments of myogenic markers) obtained from cells cultured onto substrates of varying elasticity and cell-adhesion will be used to probe signaling pathways including mitochondrial/metabolic signaling pathways in cultured MuSCs. We propose that the implementation of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) paradigms represents a critical next step for integrating multi- layer -omics datasets and building predictive models that will more comprehensively elucidate stem cell responses to the extrinsic biophysical environment.  The overarching goal of this Supplement is to test the central hypothesis that Biological data and domain knowledge relating to muscle aging can be embedded in a framework of Bayesian optimization will allow for elucidating mechanisms and accurately predicting regenerative responses. This central hypothesis will be tested by conducting three specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To prepare -omics data for ML models: Curate datasets, identify and impute missing data, compile metadata, and pre-process data to quantify descriptors used in model building. Adopt data management protocols associated with best practices. Specific Aim 2. To perform benchmark ML modeling with Bayesian optimization: Identify environmental variables (ECM stiffness and composition, signaling molecules) and cellular characteristics (age, expression markers) that correlate with epigenetic signatures and myogenicity, then develop mechanistic ML models and estimate posterior distributions. Specific Aim 3. To broaden approaches to ML modeling and broaden researcher engagement in the biology of aging: CMU will host a hackathon with teams that combine students and researchers from regional universities and HBCU partners. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly individuals, muscle injury often results in dramatic functional declines, with these declines being largely a result of an impaired regenerative response. The focus of the parent grant is to investigate how age- related changes in the biophysical skeletal muscle microenvironment contribute to an impaired muscle stem cell function and defective healing after an acute injury. In this Administrative Supplement, we will extend the aims of this project by developing machine learning/artificial intelligence models that estimate biological age of muscle stem cells and predict regenerative potential.",Role of extracellular matrix in age-related declines of muscle regeneration,10410777,R01AG061005,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Elasticity ', ' Environment ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Goals ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Descriptor ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' data management ', ' muscle progenitor cell ', ' muscle stem cell ', ' Muscle satellite cell ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' healing ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Impairment ', ' parent grant ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' stem cell biology ', ' muscle aging ', ' aged muscle ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Regenerative response ', ' regeneration response ', ' model building ', ' hackathon ', ' hack day ', ' hackfest ', ' age-related muscle loss ', ' age associated muscle atrophy ', ' age-associated decline in muscle ', ' age-associated muscle decline ', ' age-associated muscle deterioration ', ' age-associated muscle loss ', ' age-associated muscle wasting ', ' age-related decline in muscle ', ' age-related muscle decline ', ' age-related muscle deterioration ', ' age-related muscle wasting ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' stem cell function ', ' progenitor cell function ', ' regeneration potential ', ' regenerative potential ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,281359,PA-18
"Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease Skeletal muscles are responsible for movement, breathing, posture and metabolism. Loss of muscle function via acute injury or chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. In the US, there are over 12 million cases of sprains and strains injuries each year, an estimated 50 million people living with age-related sarcopenia, and another 250,000 with NMDs. My long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the muscle repair and develop therapies for chronic muscle disorders. A major barrier in this endeavor is our limited of understanding of the multiplicity of cell types involved during muscle regeneration. Little is known regarding functions of each cell type and how they interact with tissue-resident stem cells to regulate the restoration of muscle function. Thus, tissue cytometry, the mapping of single cells within tissues, is necessary to gain novel insights into cellular interactions during muscle regeneration and in dysregulated disease states. My central hypothesis is that local signaling in the cellular microenvironment regulate the behavior of critical cell types to remodel or repair the tissue. To this, I have optimized a novel multiplexed imaging technology (CODEX) that enables visualizes 40+ antibodies on a single muscle section. In the proposed research, I aim to (i) develop technologies to study cellular interactions using high dimensional imaging data and build a single cell resolution spatial map of the localization, abundance, dynamics, and interactions of 25 cell type within normal muscle regeneration and disease states; (ii) elucidate critical cell types and spatially-localized signaling that determine the proper expansion and differentiation of muscle stem cells; (iii) deep profile the function of M2 macrophages and fibroadipogenic precursors in process of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling. The training I will receive during the mentored phase of this proposal will be critical for the success of this project. Moreover, application of this systematic approach to study inter-cellular signaling will allow me to achieve academic independence. The proposed experiments in the K99 phase will provide novel insights into the coordinated process of tissue regeneration and will yield candidate signaling molecules with the potential to modulate the function of muscle stem cells. Further, the proposed project for the R00 phase will lead to better understanding of the cellular responses and fundamental mechanisms of motor neuron and neuromuscular junction remodeling, which has significant relevance for nerve injuries and chronic autoimmune neuromuscular diseases. Loss of muscle function in chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) is debilitating to quality of life and is associated with high healthcare burden. A major barrier in the development of effective therapies for NMDs is our limited of understanding of the various types of cells involved in normal muscle repair and what goes awry in disease. Here, I develop novel technologies to simultaneously visualize and study the interaction of more than 25 cell types in skeletal muscle, which will allow us to uncover critical interactions that determine efficient muscle regeneration as well as pinpoint disruptions in chronic NMD.",Spatial Regulators of Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Disease,10271399,K99NS120278,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Autoimmune Responses ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Denervation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ligands ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Muscular Atrophy ', ' Muscle Atrophy ', ' muscle breakdown ', ' muscle degradation ', ' muscle deterioration ', ' muscle loss ', ' muscle wasting ', ' Myopathy ', ' Muscle Disease ', ' Muscle Disorders ', ' Muscular Diseases ', ' Myopathic Conditions ', ' Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Myopathic disease or syndrome ', ' muscular disorder ', ' Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Nerve ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Neuromuscular Junction ', ' Myoneural Junction ', ' Posture ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sciatic nerve ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sprains and Strains ', ' Standardization ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' mdx mouse ', ' Training ', ' Muscle function ', ' reinnervation ', ' reinnervate ', ' insight ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Muscle Fibers ', ' Myotubes ', ' Rhabdomyocyte ', ' Skeletal Fiber ', ' Skeletal Muscle Cell ', ' Skeletal Muscle Fiber ', ' Skeletal Myocytes ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' cell type ', ' restoration ', ' Myocytes ', ' Muscle Cells ', ' myogenesis ', ' success ', ' muscle progenitor cell ', ' muscle stem cell ', ' Muscle satellite cell ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Experimental Myasthenia ', ' Experimental Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis ', ' Cytometry ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell-Cell Signaling ', ' intercellular communication ', ' B220 ', ' CD45 ', ' GP180 ', ' LY5 ', ' PTPRC ', ' T200 ', ' PTPRC gene ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' tissue regeneration ', ' regenerate new tissue ', ' regenerate tissue ', ' regenerating damaged tissue ', ' regenerating tissue ', ' tissue renewal ', ' tissue specific regeneration ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neuromuscular ', ' muscle regeneration ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' progenitor ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' strain injury ', ' tissue repair ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' stem cell function ', ' progenitor cell function ', ' Autoimmune ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,88722,CA-18
"A data-driven approach towards generation of permeable peptide therapeutics Project Summary  A staggering number of potential targets for combating diseases fall into a category called undruggable, targets that are not accessible to two commonly used drug modalites: antibodies and small molecules. These undruggable targets often reside inside the cells and cannot be accessed by antibodies, which are too large to cross the cell membrane. Their flat surfaces deviate from the common deep pockets that are often hit by small molecules. To untap the potential of these targets, we need a therapeutic modality that can target shallow pockets and cross the cell membrane. Peptides are at the size range and composition that can be an ideal choice as this alternative modality.  Despite efforts in developing high affinity peptide binders, generating permeable binders has been a long-standing challenge. The few examples of cell permeable functional peptides are often developed through error and trial or via many rounds of modification and testing. The challenge in obtaining permeable binders is mainly due to lack of high throughput methods to screen for permeability, which has not only limited the power of library-based screening for obtaining permeable binders, but has also resulted in a limited amount of experimental data from which one can deduce rules that govern a peptide permeable. Thus, the use of peptides as therapeutics to drug the undruggable has remained largely underdeveloped.  This proposal uses an interdisciplinary approach to address this challenge. We generate a network to represent the peptide space in a meaningful manner. We then cluster this network and select for experimental testing a set that is truly representative of the peptide space. The results of our tests, which include both artificial membrane analysis and cellular uptake in bacterial and mammalian cells, can thus be generalized to the entire space. This unprecedented dataset will then be used as a starting point to gain better understanding of peptide permeability and to develop experimental and computational methods for rapid identification of permeable peptide binders that can be used as leads for therapeutic development. We will use this dataset to develop an automated generative algorithm that computationally designs permeable peptides that can target a target interface of interest.  This proposal is a leap in the field of peptide therapeutic development. The dataset generated during this work and methods we develop will be the stepping stone for many researchers interested in drug discovery, physics-based models of permeability, and peptide therapeutics. Project Narrative  A large portion of potential drug targets are inaccessible to the most widely used therapeutic modalities: small molecules and antibodies. Peptides are powerful alternatives for drugging these targets; however, their use has been hugely underexplored due to challenges in the way of obtaining cell-permeable peptides that can access intracellular targets. In this proposal, we use a novel data-driven approach that combines state-of-the-art computational techniques, such as peptide design and machine learning, with experimental data generation to develop methods and datasets that will pave the way for the development of next generation cell-permeable peptide therapeutics.",A data-driven approach towards generation of permeable peptide therapeutics,10241206,DP2GM146249,"['Antibodies ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Libraries ', ' Artificial Membranes ', ' Methods ', ' Peptides ', ' Permeability ', ' Physics ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Surface ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' uptake ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' drug discovery ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' peptide drug ', ' therapeutic peptide ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,DP2,2021,1301850,OR-04
