"Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments Project Summary: My goal is to build an independent research program in the development of causal inference methods for investigating environmental causes of childhood cancer. This K01 will enable me to conduct the focused, intensive research that will lay the groundwork for that program and to acquire the environmental, biological, and epidemiological training needed to maximize the rigor and impact of my work. Research: We propose to develop new causal machine learning (ML) methods that enable rigorous analysis of environmental natural experiments (NE) for estimation of the causal effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer. Classical approaches to studying relationships between environmental exposures and childhood cancer are plagued with challenges and are yielding inconsistent findings. We contend that the recent proliferation of local environmental regulatory programs has created ample relevant NEs, which provide a powerful alternative approach to study these relationships. However, existing methods for NE analysis are poorly-suited for environmental health contexts. In particular, existing methods fail in the presence of rare outcomes like childhood cancer (Aim 1), and they are not able to provide insight into the timing at which children are most susceptible to any adverse exposure effects (Aim 2). We propose causal ML methods that overcome these challenges and apply them to a NE to study the effects of traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia. We also provide open source software implementing these methods (Aim 3). Career Development and Training: Given my extensive prior training and experience in statistics and data science, the primary aim of the training funded by this award will be the acquisition of subject-matter proficiency, which will provide me with the insights needed to create more effective and impactful environmental health methods. Specifically, I will pursue knowledge in the biology and epidemiology of childhood cancer and in environmental health and exposure biology. The training will be achieved through a combination of (1) hands-on collaborative research as described above; (2) intensive cross-disciplinary mentorship, with mentors specializing in environmental health, pediatric oncology, cancer biology and epidemiology, and statistics; (3) carefully-selected coursework in the Departments of Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and Cell Biology at Harvard; and (4) relevant conferences, workshops, and seminars. I will place special emphasis on establishing a network of expert collaborators in all my areas of training. Environment: The Harvard Medical Campus is home to the top research teams worldwide in both childhood cancer and environmental health. Due to Harvard’s position at the forefront of scientific discovery in these fields, its unparalleled resources, its vibrant intellectual atmosphere, and its promotion of collaborative science that integrates knowledge across disciplines, it provides an ideal environment in which to train on these topics. Project Narrative: Decades of research on the relationship between environmental exposures and childhood cancer, relying on classic epidemiologic study designs, has produced a largely inconclusive body of literature, and has generated little robust, actionable evidence to protect children’s health. We propose an alternative methodological approach to this problem, which relies on environmental natural experiments to overcome many of the challenges presented by classic approaches. We develop causal machine learning methods tailored to this setting, which provide a promising new avenue for obtaining robust evidence about environmental causes of childhood cancer, and we apply the methods to study the effects of exposure to traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia.",Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments,10104187,K01ES032458,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Award ', ' Benzene ', ' Benzol ', ' Benzole ', ' Cyclohexatriene ', ' Biology ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Gasoline ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' leukemia ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' workplace exposure ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Work ', ' 1,3-Butadiene ', ' divinyl ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' environmental agent ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Pediatric Leukemia ', ' children with leukemia ', ' leukemia in children ', ' Childhood Leukemia ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Pediatric Oncology ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' health application ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' health data ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' college atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' education atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' school atmosphere ', ' school climate ', ' training atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' Data Science ', ' Time trend ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Child Health ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2021,138538,MA-07

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells Summary/Abstract The development of novel therapies for pediatric cancers, the second leading cause of death in children, is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive pharmacogenomics resources, unlike the well-established ones in adult cancers. However, breakthroughs in deep learning methods allow learning of intricate pharmacogenomics patterns with unprecedented performance. With a uniquely cross-disciplinary background, the candidate for this proposed K99/R00 has already, as a postdoctoral fellow, (i) developed and published several deep learning models that accurately predicted adult cancer cells’ drug sensitivity and genetic dependency using high- throughput genomics profiles, and (ii) demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the model to predict tumors by a ‘transfer learning’ design. The candidate will extend this research to study pediatric cancers and test the central hypothesis that deep learning extracts genomics signatures to predict the responses of pediatric cancer cells to chemical and genetic perturbations. The proposed study will develop novel deep learning models for predicting drug sensitivity and/or genetic dependency for (Aim 1) currently un-screened pediatric cancer cell lines by learning from screens of adult cells, and (Aim 2) pediatric tumors by learning from adult and/or pediatric cells. Prediction results will be validated by in vitro experiments and data collected from patient-derived xenografts. The proposed study is the first attempt to employ modern computational methods to advance pharmacogenomics studies of pediatric cancer, which would be difficult and costly to pursue via biological assays. Findings will shed light on the optimal drugs and novel therapeutic targets for pediatric malignancies, leading to an optimal and efficient design of preclinical tests. The candidate has a remarkable track record of bioinformatics studies of adult cancer genomics. The focus of this K99 training plan is to develop in-depth understanding of pediatric cancer and preclinical treatment models, and strengthen multifaceted components needed for a successful research career in cancer bioinformatics. The primary mentor, Dr. Peter Houghton, is a renowned leader in pediatric cancer research and preclinical drug testing programs. The candidate also has assembled an outstanding mentor team: Dr. Yidong Chen (co-mentor), a cancer genomics expert and pioneer in bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput technologies; Dr. Jinghui Zhang (collaborator), a computational biologist and leader in integrative genomics studies of major pediatric cancer genome consortiums; Dr. Yufei Huang (collaborator), an expert in state-of-the-art deep learning methods; and two highly knowledgeable consultants with relevant expertise. With this team’s guidance and structured training activities in an ideal training environment, the candidate will strengthen his skills in grant writing and lab management, teaching and mentoring, and broad connections. Overall, the K99/R00 award will be an indispensable support for a timely transition of the candidate to a successful career as a multifaceted, cross-disciplinary investigator in cancer bioinformatics. Narrative Pediatric cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, and genetic studies to inform new drug therapies have been challenging. The proposal will utilize deep learning bioinformatics methods to transfer well-established pharmacogenomics knowledge for adult cancers to the study of pediatric cancers. The findings will facilitate the optimal usage of existing drugs and the development of novel therapies for pediatric cancer, and will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research

"Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma Project Summary  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related (HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV+ HCC) attributes to 85% of all HCC cases in China, and therapeutic options are limited. This project will forge a collaboration between a computational team in the US and an HCC oncology team in China to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of a large Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort using the new proteogenomic approach that systematically integrates genomics and mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. This collaborative project will produce new biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC as well as experimentally validated computational methods that can be broadly applied to proteogenomic studies in other cancer types and other diseases.",Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma,10135876,R01CA245903,"['Antigens ', '

"Systems biology of quiescence entry Abstract This proposal aims to provide crucial training for the candidate’s long-term career plan to study how cellular quiescence is established through decision-making processes. The decision to undergo quiescence in response to stress or developmental signals is a fundamental and understudied property of living systems. Failure to maintain quiescence can lead to cell proliferation disorders in humans, such as fibrosis or cancer. Quiescence entry is triggered when multiple nutrient- and stress-sensing signaling pathways arrest the cell cycle machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate stress response pathways with the cell cycle during quiescence remain largely unclear. This is, in part, due to the difficulties to simultaneously quantify multiple stress pathways at the single cell level in vivo. To solve this limitation, the candidate will use a microfluidics- fluorescent imaging system that tracks up to six different pathways simultaneously during the transition from proliferation into quiescence. Using this approach, the coordination between stress responses and the cell cycle machinery can be quantified with unprecedented temporal resolution in the model organism S. cerevisiae. A computational platform based on machine learning and time series analysis will be used to process the large imaging data derived from tracking six biomarkers simultaneously in single cells. An initial version of this framework found that during the onset of quiescence the nuclear levels of the conserved DNA-replication kinase Cdc7 are dynamically regulated. This approach also identified that the nuclear levels of the stress-activated transcriptional repressor Xbp1 define how the cell cycle is stopped during quiescence entry. Combining this computational approach with biochemical techniques will determine the molecular mechanisms for the establishment of cellular quiescence by modulation of stress responses and the cell cycle machinery. The candidate is to acquire crucial training in computational biology during the K99 phase of this proposal to complement his previous training in biochemistry, cell biology and yeast genetics. The candidate will be mentored by a leader in computational biology Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, whose lab develops advanced machine learning and time series analysis to study cellular signal transduction. This proposal harnesses the commitment of an entire bioinformatics core facility and the training environment of a world-class research institution at UTSW. Establishing a unique computational and imaging framework, combined with biochemical approaches for the study of quiescence, will support the candidate’s transition to an independent research academic position and will lead to the discovery of biomedically relevant principles of quiescence and cell cycle regulation. Narrative The precise integration of stress signals during the establishment of cellular quiescence is crucial to prevent cell proliferation disorders, such as fibrosis and cancer. However, it is unclear how stress responses are integrated during quiescence, in part, because of a lack of methods for simultaneously quantifying multiple stress pathways in single cells. To solve this problem, the proposed work will combine machine learning approaches with six color fluorescent microscopy to reveal the mechanisms by which stress responses coordinate

"The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This U24 application is written in response to RFA-AT-20-003 to establish a high-priority research network on emotional well-being (EWB). While psychological research on well-being has dramatically increased over the past 15 years, virtually all of this work has been descriptive and has not emphasized the “how” of well-being: How might well-being be cultivated? In addition, virtually all of the extant work on the correlates of individual differences in well-being has used responses on retrospective questionnaires as the primary tool to assess well-being. While there have been exciting findings, particularly relating individual differences in well-being to various indices of physical health, many questions remain and methodological limitations plague the validity of this work. This U24 network will assemble a highly multi-disciplinary group of 10 investigators across 3 (or more in the future) institutions to significantly advance our understanding of the “how” of EWB, identify the core plastic constituents of EWB, specify and/or develop robust measures of these constituents at biological, behavioral and experiential levels of analysis and characterize the plasticity of these constituents. The measurement strategy will ultimately focus on the development of technology-based passive measures of EWB that require no explicit user input and are highly scalable. The network will also focus its efforts on the development and evaluation of programs to train EWB and will assess whether such programs might serve as prevention strategies. The network will consist of scientists and scholars from a broad range of fields including psychology, neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering, population health and biology, computer science and the humanities. These scientists and scholars will focus on the following major aims: Aim 1: To arrive at a core consensus of the minimal set of constituents that can be described and measured at biological, behavioral and experiential levels that constitute the plastic elements of EWB and to specify already existing measures and /or develop novel measures of each of these constructs at each level of analysis. Aim 2: Using the active measures described in Aim 1, to develop passive measures using digital technologies of at least two of the core constituents of well-being. Aim 3: To develop pilot projects specifically focusing on prevention strategies for learning well-being in various samples. The network will train new investigators and bring established investigators into this new field, disseminate a framework for understanding the plasticity of well- being, a toolbox of measures for assessing the plasticity of components of well-being, and several pilot datasets that showcase the novel passive and field-friendly biological measures. In these ways, the network will dramatically accelerate progress in the nascent field of EWB. PROJECT NARRATIVE This U24 network on emotional well-being (EWB) will catalyze the emerging field of the plasticity of well-being and will showcase how well-being can be learned and the consequences of such skill development on physical and emotional health and on prevention of disease. A framework for understanding how well-being can be learned along with measures of the core components of well-being that can be learned will be developed and disseminated. The network will also train new investigators in this area and will engage established investigators to contribute to this field.","The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing",10151850,U24AT011289,"['Program Evaluation ', ' Psychology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' meetings ', ' computer science ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Population Biology ', ' Subgroup ', ' To specify ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' standard measure ', ' mindfulness meditation ', ' population health ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Humanities ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U24,2021,620542,WI-02
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",10166783,U54CA209988,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Heterograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' everolimus ', ' SDZ RAD ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Genomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' microarray analyses ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' therapy resistant ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' epigenomics ', ' image visualization ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' analytical tool ', ' combinatorial ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' tumor ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' MDA-MB-468 ', ' bioprinting ', ' bio-printing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computational suite ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Visualization ', ' feature extraction ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2021,1851265,OR-03
"Protein Knowledge Networks and Semantic Computing for Disease Discovery Protein Knowledge Networks and Semantic Computing for Disease Discovery The growing volume and breadth of information from the scientific literature and biomedical databases pose challenges to the research community to exploit the content for discovery. This MIRA grant application will advance our knowledge mining and semantic computing system to accelerate data-driven discovery for understanding of gene-disease-drug relationships. We have employed natural language processing and machine learning approaches in a generalizable framework for bioentity and relation extraction from large-scale text. Our Protein Ontology supports protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data for both human understanding and computational reasoning. We have also developed a resource to support functional interpretation and analysis of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) across modification types and organisms. Building on our computational algorithms, bioinformatics infrastructure and community interactions, we will further develop literature mining tools to support automated information extraction across the bibliome and open linked data models for semantic integration of biomedical data from heterogeneous resources. Our text mining tools will be trained for different use cases using deep learning methods. We will develop RDF (Resource Description Framework) semantic models in an increasingly computable, inferable and explainable knowledge system to assist in hypothesis generation. We will present evidence in the form of textual artifacts and semantic models to ensure unbiased analysis and interpretation of results to promote rigorous and reproducible research. We will develop scientific case studies to drive the system development. Examples include PTM disease variant and enrichment analyses for drug target identification, genotype- phenotype knowledge mining for Alzheimer's Disease understanding, and gene-disease-drug knowledge network construction for COVID-19 drug repurposing. To foster community engagement, we will host workshops and hackathons to address critical fundamental research questions and emerging disease scenarios. We have fully adopted the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for resource sharing. All data, tools and research results will be broadly disseminated from the project website, accessible programmatically via RESTful API, queryable via SPARQL endpoints, and dockerized for community code reuse. The successful completion of this research will thus support scalable, integrative and collaborative knowledge discovery to accelerate disease understanding and drug target discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The accelerated growth of research data of increasing volume and complexity is profoundly transforming biomedical research, allowing scientists to ask new research questions and address emerging disease scenarios.

"GENCODE: comprehensive reference genome annotation for human and mouse Project Summary The GENCODE consortium creates foundational reference genome annotation for the human and mouse genomes in which all features are identified and classified with high accuracy based on biological evidence, and then freely released for the benefit of biomedical research and genome interpretation. GENCODE seeks to create annotation that increases the understanding of genome function in both human and mouse by prioritizing human disease genes and respecting the role of mouse as the major mammalian model organism. To effectively annotate genomes, GENCODE has created a suite of tools and draws on deep expertise across its partners across four fundamental components: 1) a comprehensive gene annotation pipeline leveraging manual and computational annotation; 2) a set of computational methods to evaluate and enhance gene annotation; 3) experimental pipelines targeted to expressed sequences less detectable in standard protocols; and 4) a machine learning capacity to improve all facets of the project. GENCODE will maintain a major focus on protein-coding and non-coding loci, including their alternatively spliced isoforms and pseudogenes and will extend expert manual review to small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and the annotation of non-polyadenylated transcripts. GENCODE will also expand regulatory annotation to a defined set of gene-associated features to more accurately reflect the interconnections between regulatory regions, including those with transcribed sequences such as ncRNA, and overall transcriptional output. GENCODE will take advantage of the increasing maturity of genomics technology including long-read transcriptome sequencing, functional genomics assays, and graph- based genome representations to identify features such as genes, pseudogenes, exons and splice sites that are incorrect, incomplete or in genome regions simply not present in the current reference assembly. More specifically, in the next four years GENCODE plans to 1) extend its human and mouse gene sets to as near completion as possible given available data and current experimental technology; 2) leverage new, high-quality human genome assemblies and targeted transcriptomic data to expand representation so that more human haplotypes will have high-quality annotation 3) annotate gene-associated regulatory regions including enhancer- promoter connections 4) collaborate with other resources to ensure a consistent representation of genic and regulatory features and reference transcripts for reporting clinical variation; and 5) distribute GENCODE annotations and engage with community annotation efforts to ensure accuracy and consistency. Primary GENCODE data will continue to be available from the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers and the GENCODE web site. We will develop new mechanisms for effective two-way outreach, training and communication with the community with the long-term aim of establishing GENCODE as the standard annotation set for research and clinical genomics applications. Project Narrative The GENCODE project produces reference genome annotation for the human and mouse genomes. The annotation provides a reference from which to conduct clinical and genomics research in the short term; in the long term it informs all research that will contribute fundamental knowledge to benefit public health.",GENCODE: comprehensive reference genome annotation for human and mouse,10186568,U24HG007234,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exons ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudogenes ', ' Public Health ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Performance ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' UTRs ', ' Untranslated Regions ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Mouse Protein ', ' Small RNA ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Transcript ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Automated Annotation ', ' annotation schema ', ' computational annotation ', ' computer annotation ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mouse genome ', ' human disease ', ' loss of function ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' genome annotation ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' reference genome ', ' reference assembly ', ' genome browser ', ' computational pipelines ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' community engagement ', ' ']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2021,2973167,
"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,10224676,RC2DK114777,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aorta ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' blastomere structure ', ' Blastocytes ', ' Embryonic Cell ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell-Free System ', ' Cellfree System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' gonad ', ' gonads ', ' Grant ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' blood stem cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hemopoietic progenitor ', ' hemopoietic stem cell ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mesonephric structure ', ' Mesonephros ', ' Wolffian Body ', ' Methods ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Generations ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' Agonist ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' ES cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' novel ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Bypass ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Stem Cell Development ', ' progenitor cell development ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' loss of function ', ' self-renewal ', ' self-renew ', ' stem ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' stem cell population ', ' Systems Development ', ' clinical translation ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' hematopoietic stem cell expansion ', ' HSC expansion ', ' blood stem cell expansion ', ' hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal ', ' HSC regeneration ', ' HSC self-renewal ', ' hematopoietic stem cell regeneration ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Specification ', ' HSC Specification ', ' ']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2021,650976,WA-07
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,10223132,R24MH114788,"['Archives ', ' Atlases ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Cytosine ', ' Data Collection ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' indexing ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Staffing ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Familiarity ', ' member ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', "" Rh (2,2'-biquinoline) complex "", ' cis-(Rh(biq)2Cl2)Cl ', ' complex R ', ' histone modification ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' data integration ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' next generation ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Bioconductor ', ' brain research ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' operation ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' data archive ', ' data library ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' cloud storage ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' data resource ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Data Management System ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' data pipeline ', ' Visualization ', ' multiple data types ', ' data centers ', ' data ecosystem ', ' data sharing ecosystem ', ' public repository ', ' publicly accessible repository ', ' publicly available repository ', ' data ingestion ', ' query tools ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' data submission portal ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' archived data ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' Data Store ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2021,1263611,MD-07
"Center for Modeling Complex Interactions Biomedical problems are innately complex, and their solutions require input from many fields. Many centers focus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuses on an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based, interdisciplinary research centered around modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling into interdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stages—hypothesis formulation, experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlight commonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into this unifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everything from deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches, to physical and computational models of three- dimensional objects, to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible. We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers, and by giving them opportunities to play on interdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertise, and by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual, cultural, and physical environment to promote team- based, interdisciplinary research. In Phase II, we will build on that foundation by maintaining a strong interdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect, and by adding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry out model-based, interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding. Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groups—zero-barrier, interdisciplinary, goal- focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research Projects, Pilot Projects, Modeling Access Grants, and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparation improves grantsmanship, and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase University of Idaho’s faculty participation in biomedical research. We will add six new faculty as a commitment to this Phase II COBRE and attract broader participation from across the University. 3) Extend the reach of the Modeling Core into new areas of modeling to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Modeling Core accelerates interdisciplinary research by placing Core Fellows at the hub of the research community. We have added new Core Initiatives in machine learning and geospatial modeling to stimulate research in these areas with high potential for future growth. 4) Establish a path to long-term sustainability under the umbrella of the Institute for Modeling Collaboration & Innovation. The major hurdle for sustainability is to maintain a robust Modeling Core. We have developed a business plan that calls for us to diversify our funding sources to include institutional, state, and private support to supplement federal grants. Human health is determined by interactions of complex biological systems at multiple scales, from the ecological to the biophysical; these are layered with spatial and temporal variation. To decipher these systems requires predictive modeling, coupled with strong empirical work, to be guided by and to feed the models.

"Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY Avinash D Sahu, Ph.D., is a computational biologist whose overarching career goal is to solve longstanding problems in cancer immunology and translational precision oncology using artificial intelligence (AI) and to devise new therapeutic strategies for late-stage cancer patients. Entitled Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy, the proposed research combines cutting-edge AI technology with Immuno-oncology (IO) to produce a systematic approach to identifying drugs that synergize with immunotherapy, and prioritize them for clinical trials for advanced melanoma, bladder, kidney, and lung cancer. Career development plan: Dr. Sahu is a recipient of the Michelson Prize, and his research mission is to initiate precision immuno-oncology by moving patients away from palliative chemotherapy to more personalized IO treatments. His previous training in AI, statistics, method development, cancer, and translation biology have prepared him to conduct the proposed research. Dr. Sahu has outlined specific training activities to expand his skill set in four areas: 1) cancer immunology, 2) AI, 3) translation research and 4) new immunological assays. This skill set will be necessary to gain research independence. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Sahu mentoring and the advisory team assembles world-leading experts in computational biology, translation and clinical research, AI, statistics, and immunology. Also, Dr. Sahu has developed academic collaborations and industry partners to provide him experimental support for the proposal. Leveraging the state-of-art software and google-cloud infrastructure provided by Cancer Immune Data Commons (CIDC); computational resources from DFCI, Harvard, and Broad Institute; as well as unique access to largest immunotherapy patient data from collaborators, Dr. Sahu is uniquely placed to identify most promising IO drug combinations. Research: There is a lack of a principled approach to identify promising IO drug combinations that has often led to arbitrarily designed IO clinical trials without a sound biological basis. The proposal formulates the first in silico predictor to estimate drug’s immunomodulatory effect and potential to synergize with immunotherapies. Aim 1 builds a novel deep learning predictor —DeepImmune— to predict immunotherapy response from transcriptomes. Aim 2 estimates the immunomodulatory effects of drugs from for its drug-induced transcriptomic changes using DeepImmune. Aim 3 prioritize top predicted immunomodulatory drugs and validate their effect in pre-clinical models. Outcomes/Impact: The successful completion of the proposal will result in a robust predictor to rationally combine cancer therapies with immunotherapy and set the basis for a clinical trial to test the most promising combination therapy. The career development award and mentored research will enable Dr. Sahu to become a leader in the new field of research at the intersection of precision immuno-oncology and AI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Combining immunotherapies with other cancer drugs has emerged as a new hope for late-stage cancer patients, however, the lack of a principled approach to identify such effective combinations often led to poorly designed clinical trials. The proposed research engages state-of-art Artificial Intelligence techniques with drug-induced transcriptomic changes to identify drugs that synergize with immunotherapies and prioritize them for clinical trials. Its application, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will rationalize clinical trials, identify new treatments for advanced cancers, and advance precision

"UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center Project Summary / Abstract A major shortcoming of most efforts to understand the 4D nucleome is that they have mainly focused on in vitro cell lines, rather than on dynamic, in vivo systems. Arguably, the most important in vivo system, which also happens to be the most dynamic, is development itself, wherein the nucleome both shapes and is shaped by the initial emergence of the myriad mammalian cell types. While these in vivo dynamics are presently poorly documented and understood, recently emerged technologies offer a path forward. Here we propose to establish the University of Washington 4-Dimensional Genomic Nuclear Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME Center), which will address these massive gaps in our understanding by generating systematic datasets on nuclear morphology and associated molecular measurements in mammalian tissues and cell types. These datasets will be generated in the context of the leading model organism for mammalian development, the mouse. Our approach focuses on following nuclear structure, chromatin and gene expression changes at a “whole organism” scale, using a combination of scalable single cell profiling and “visual cell sorting” (VCS) methods, all well-established and mostly developed in our own labs. Our goal is to generate a high- resolution 4DN atlas of mouse embryogenesis for the community. The different types of data will be integrated, including cross-species imputation to integrate with human data, as well as models and navigable maps applied to pathways relevant to mammalian development. Project Narrative The UW 4D Genome Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME) aims to elucidate chromatin dynamics during the early stages of mammalian development. Accordingly, the proposed center will carry out systematic generation of sequencing and imaging data during mouse embryogenesis, summarizing and visualizing the resulting data using machine learning models.

"Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services. In coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, we will support a new Geropathology Research initiative.

"Informatics Tools To Analyze And Model Whole Slide Image Data At The Single Cell Level Project Summary  Digital scanning of tissue slides, including both hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained slides, is becoming a routine clinical procedure. Technological advances in imaging, computing and molecular profiling have enabled in-depth tissue characterization at single-cell resolution while retaining the cell spatial information and its histological context. The confluence of these developments has created unprecedented opportunities for studying the relationships among tumor morphology, molecular events, and clinical outcomes. However, there is a lack of computational tools that can fully utilize the comprehensive information in tissue images at the single-cell level. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop iSEE-Cell (image-based Spatial pattern ExplorEr for Cells), a suite of informatics tools to enable image data analysis, spatial modeling and data integration at single-cell resolution. In order to achieve this goal, we have built a strong research team with complementary expertise in image analysis, machine learning, spatial modelling, single cell genomics, cancer pathology and software development. Specifically, we will: 1. Develop algorithms to classify different types of cells based on nucleus morphology, that will be applicable to all types of tissue images. 2. Develop a powerful image restoration tool and quality enhancer for restoring blurred regions, enhancing low resolution/magniﬁcation into high resolution, and normalizing staining colors. 3. Develop and integrate tissue image analysis, spatial modeling and visualization tools into the iSEE-Cell platform. We will engage users, including informaticians, oncologists, pathologists, surgeons and cancer biologists, in the process of algorithm and tool development to collect feedback for the proposed informatics tools. All proposed methods were motivated by real-world biological and clinical applications. If implemented successfully, the proposed study will facilitate users in studying the tumor microenvironment and in improving cancer risk assessment, diagnosis, and outcome prediction.

"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,10246414,F32GM134595,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biology ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Fellowship ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Biological ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' professor ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' disease phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' driving force ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' math sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' genomic profiles ', ' genetic signature ', ' gene signatures ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,70458,MI-08
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy.

"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",10247827,UH3CA246633,"['Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biopsy ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Decidua ', ' Decidua Graviditas ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Freeze Drying ', ' Freeze Dryings ', ' Lyophilization ', ' Goals ', ' Granuloma ', ' Granulomatous Lesion ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Institutes ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ions ', ' Metals ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Phenotype ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 1st trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Trimester ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Pulmonary Tuberculosis ', ' Lung TB ', ' Lung Tuberculosis ', ' Pulmonary TB ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Tissue Embedding ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Organ ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion ', ' SIMS Microscopy ', ' Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry Microscopy ', ' Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy Microscopy ', ' Spectroscopy, Mass, Secondary Ion ', ' Funding ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' immune-based cancer therapies ', ' immunotherapy for cancer ', ' immunotherapy of cancer ', ' Letters ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' human tissue ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Medical center ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Allergic ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Formalin ', ' protein expression ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' reagent standardization ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' technology validation ', ' technology implementation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' ion source ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' user-friendly ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging platform ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' human imaging ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' Human BioMolecular Atlas Program ', ' HuBMAP ', ' computational pipelines ', ' feature extraction ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2021,547000,CA-18
"Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY This administrative supplement request aims to develop a cloud-enabled, highly scalable version of the computational core of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA-CC: www.megasoftware.net). The development of MEGA-CC is a significant component of the NIH-funded research project to develop machine learning methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences. With big advances in genome sequencing, researchers are assembling datasets containing large numbers of species, strains, genes, and genomic segments. Phylogenomic analyses of these data are essential to understanding the dynamics of evolutionary change of pathogens, humans, and species across the tree of life. Machine learning methods and software tools for phylogenomics are now necessary because the expanding size of phylogenomic datasets limits the practical utility of currently available methods and tools due to excessive computational time and memory requirements. One component of the funded grant is implementing our new machine learning methods in the MEGA software suite (www.megasoftware.net), an extremely popular bioinformatics software (>20,000 peer-reviewed citations and 350,000 software downloads in the year 2020 alone). The MEGA software includes a large repertoire of tools for assembling sequence alignments, inferring evolutionary trees, estimating genetic distances and diversities, inferring ancestral sequences, computing timetrees, and testing selection. These analyses are now required in all research investigations and fields in which multiple DNA or RNA sequences are used. However, MEGA and its computational core (MEGA-CC) are not optimized for distribution and execution on cloud infrastructure and high-performance computing clusters. This supplement to the funded grant will enable us to advance MEGA for cloud readiness to harness the scalability, elastic computing power, and easy software upgrade and maintenance enabled by cloud infrastructure (MEGA-CR). It will also make MEGA interoperable with existing and future cloud infrastructure. Additionally, this supplement will facilitate using the new machine learning methods in MEGA with big genomic data in practice, thus addressing an imminent and fast-growing need for an increasingly larger community of researchers using MEGA. MEGA-CR will increase the usability of MEGA for the scientific community analyzing very large datasets for which greater accessibility, cost-efficiency, and scalability of cloud-readiness is becoming crucial. Narrative We propose to develop a cloud-enabled, highly scalable version of the computational core of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA-CC: www.megasoftware.net).

"Informing the Emergency Care of Septic Shock Patients: A Novel Application of Data-Driven Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Septic shock is a commonly, costly, and deadly condition. There is increasing recognition that septic shock patients vary significantly in terms of (1) clinical presentation, (2) response to treatments, and (3) clinical outcomes. This patient-level heterogeneity may explain why optimal early septic shock management remains poorly understood. Patients with septic shock are four times more likely to die than septic patients without shock. Our preliminary data shows that Black patients have higher odds of mortality from septic shock compared to White patients. Current studies do not characterize patient heterogeneity among septic shock patients and do not explicate pharmacogenetic factors that may influence disparities in outcomes. Objective: Insights from synergistic data types are necessary to provide a more complete understanding of septic shock heterogeneity and hereditable factors that may influence vasopressor response and disparities in outcomes. The overall objective of the proposed research is to characterize both phenotypic and genetic aspects of heterogeneity in septic shock. This work is organized into two aims: (1) Identify Septic Shock Phenotypes Using Advanced Analytic Methods and (2) Quantify Vasopressor Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms by Race and Vasopressor Response. Our overall hypothesis is that advanced analytic methods applied to clinical and genetic data can identify defining features of septic shock heterogeneity that are relevant to early septic shock management in the Emergency Department and disparities in outcomes. Methods: (Aim 1) We will use a national dataset of septic patients with hypotension refractory to initial Emergency Department fluid resuscitation and apply unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to define clinically relevant phenotypes of early septic shock patients. We will analyze phenotypic variation in clinical characteristics and outcomes. Then, we will develop a supervised model for phenotype classification. (Aim 2) We will perform targeted pharmacogenomics of 100 samples balanced for race, 73 of which are part of an existing research biobank of septic shock patients from our urban, safety-net hospital. We will enroll an additional 27 patients to complete the sample. We will examine the presence of risk alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms for vasopressor-relevant genes by race. We will also examine the association between the targeted genetic polymorphisms and shock reversal. Career Development: During the proposed Career Development Award, I will work with my mentorship team to build the skills necessary to achieve independence as a clinical researcher. Specifically, I will 1) receive hands-on experience in the design and conduct of translational clinical research studies, 2) take didactic coursework in data science, biomedical informatics, and implementation science, 3) receive training and education in translational data science, clinical decision support, pharmacogenomics, and precision public health, and 4) become a leader and an effective mentor in academic emergency medicine. Project Narrative Septic shock is the most severe manifestation of sepsis and has a mortality rate above 40%. Unfortunately, existing sepsis research is limited by poorly understood variation and heterogeneity within septic shock patient populations. This study innovatively combines electronic health record and genetic data to improve the care of critically ill Emergency Department patients with septic shock, and addresses disparities in racial

"Developing data science solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa: the HE2AT Center HE2AT Center Overall - Project summary/abstract The world's climate is changing rapidly, with global temperatures having risen more than 1°C since the industrial revolution, and a further 0.5°C increase is likely by 2040. Heat waves and rising temperatures have major, though underappreciated, health implications, particularly for vulnerable populations in low-income settings. The overarching objective of the Heat and Health African Transdisciplinary Center (HE2AT Center) is to develop innovative solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa. The consortium of academic and non-academic partners is drawn from across sub-Saharan Africa and from the United States, and constitutes a transdisciplinary group, including heat physiologists, biomedical and climate content experts, public health practitioners, social-behavioral scientists as well as statisticians, and computer and data scientists. The Center will systematically develop a data ecosystem containing biomedical data, integrated with weather, air quality and other environmental data, and other geospatial data within two existing highly- complementary data platforms (IBM-PAIRS and the University of Cape Town). Over five years we will implement two Research Projects and 10-12 Pilot Projects, all streamlined and supported by the Administration, Data Management and Analysis, and Training and Engagement Cores. The first Project will implement an innovative data science approach to characterize the clinical outcomes of heat exposure in pregnant women and neonates. We will reuse data from cohorts and trials among pregnant women and neonates conducted across sub-Saharan Africa since the year 2000. Data from systematically identified studies will be integrated in an Individual Participant Data platform from data repositories and data owners. Then, analyses of relationships between heat exposure and outcomes (preterm birth, birth weight and pre- eclampsia) will inform quantification of heat-related disease burden. Finally, taking all findings together, we will pilot a district-level climate change indicator, the first of its kind. The second Project assesses the burden of heat-related morbidity in vulnerable urban settings using geospatial and heat hazard analyses in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire and Johannesburg, South Africa. This Project uses more complex data and data sources on the built environment and topography, for example, to assess heat-health impacts, and how these vary across urban geographies. Activities will inform development of an Early Warning System, including a digital App that delivers information to people on their forecasted risks of heat-health disease, based on their individualized risk profile, as determined by a machine learning algorithm which takes into account weather conditions, individual characteristics, geolocation and other factors that drive risk. These systems are a central element in heatwave responses, allow for adequate preparations for heat events, which is especially important for vulnerable groups and industry. We will collaborate closely with other Hubs and parts of the DS-I Africa consortium, supporting them to incorporate climate data within their research activities, and vice versa. HE2AT Center Overall - Project Narrative The Heat and Health African Transdisciplinary Center (HE2AT Center) will generate new knowledge on the impacts of heat waves and extreme heat on clinical conditions and on people living in vulnerable urban settings, applying data sciences approaches to existing environmental and high-quality health outcomes data. Perhaps more importantly, the Center will develop and test innovative solutions for tracking heat-related conditions at a district level and for providing individualized early warnings of dangerous heat periods relevant to high-risk groups, industry and the general population. In all Center activities we will build capacity of the team and key organizations, engage with communities, government and other stakeholder, and work across the DS-I Africa Program.",Developing data science solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa: the HE2AT Center,10314149,U54TW012083,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Air ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Influentials ', ' Ivory Coast ', "" Cote d'Ivoire "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' South Africa ', ' Specificity ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Planets ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' urban location ', ' urban region ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' data management ', ' hazard ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' neonate ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' digital ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Heat Waves ', ' heatwave ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care. As part of the feasibility phase of the Translator program, we have developed a disease-agnostic framework and approach for openly exposing clinical data that have been integrated at the patient- and visit-level with environmental exposures data: the Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES). We have validated ICEES and demonstrated the service’s ability to replicate and extend published findings on asthma, while also supporting open team science, accelerated translational discovery, and integration with the broader Translator ecosystem. This proposal aims to move ICEES from prototype to development via creation of an ICEES+ Knowledge Provider (KP). Specifically, we aim to address three major challenges that we have identified through research and development (R&D) of the prototype ICEES in an effort to improve the quality, value, and impact of query answers and assertions. Specific Aim 1. Advance the rigor of insights and assertions that ICEES provides. Our prototype ICEES currently provides the ability to dynamically define cohorts and conduct simple statistical associations to examine bivariate relationships between feature variables. Recently, we have identified an approach to extend the bivariate functionalities to support multivariate analysis of the data. For the proposed work, we will apply multivariate analyses, including traditional statistical methods (e.g., regression models) and machine learning methods (e.g., bayesian neural network models, variational autoencoder models), and systematically quantify the extent of data loss and analytic bounds when algorithms are imposed on the ICEES+ KP open application programming interface (API) versus the Institutional Review Board (IRB)– protected, fully identified, pre-binned, underlying integrated feature tables. The overall goal is to provide users with more rigorous insights and estimates of the robustness, validity, accuracy, and specificity of knowledge and assertions generated via the ICEES+ KP OpenAPI. Specific Aim 2. Address issues related to space–time and causality. Clinical and environmental data are inherently spatiotemporal, with observations or events that are contingent on space and time and may be causally related. For the proposed work, we will evaluate and implement technical approaches (e.g., ICEES+ design modifications), spatiotemporal statistical algorithms (e.g., conditional auto-regression), recurrent neural network models, and causal inference models. As part of this effort, we will derive insights from and contribute real-world evidence to support Causal Activity Models and Adverse Outcome Pathways. We also will explore approaches for incorporating into ICEES+ nationwide public data on school exposures—data that will allow us to begin to address patient mobility. Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the security of the ICEES+ KP to ensure that patient privacy is preserved as new capabilities are enabled. ImPACT is an NSF-funded package of tools and services that provides end-to-end infrastructure and support for privacy-assured research and computation on sensitive data. Over the award period, we will implement and evaluate ImPACT security protocols, focusing initially on application of the ImPACT secure multiparty computation (SMC) algorithm as a method to support secure multi-institutional sharing of data on rare diseases and events—a functionality that is not currently supported by ICEES. In addition, we will evaluate other ImPACT security protocols, working under the guidance of a security advisor and in the context of driving use cases and capabilities developed under Specific Aims1 and 2. Importantly, the project aims will be driven by three use cases and associated high-value queries designed to complement and extend our asthma-focused work on the prototype ICEES: (1) an asthma cohort from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR) at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS); (2) a primary ciliary disease cohort (PCD) from the UNC PCD Registry; and (3) a drug-induced liver injury (DILI) cohort from the National DILI Network. These use cases will invoke new diseases, new data types, new organ systems, new institutions, and new queries, thereby stress-testing the ICEES framework and approach and moving it from prototype to development as the ICEES+ KP.

"Medical Image Perception Society XIX Conference MIPS XIX brings together an international community of experts from different fields including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians, psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists, all investigating the extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. The meeting forges research and learning opportunities for new trainees and young researchers in a dedicated multidisciplinary forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XIX is being organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society; Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD President) in conjunction with local hosts Karla Evans, PhD (University of York Psychology) and Mark McEntee, PhD (University College Cork Clinical Therapies); and committee (University of York) trainee member Emma Raat. It will run July 19-21, 2021 at the Novatel York Centre located near the University of York campus. Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XIX, reflecting important dimensions of medical image interpretation. This year’s special focus themes are 1) Improving Diagnostic & Screening Performance (or outcomes) in Radiology Using Human & Machine Expertise and 2) Technological & Human Interventions for Enhancing Medical Image Perception. Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on “meaningful use” and “accountable care” to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care, the role the clinician as decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern methods to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding basic aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making quality. This grant will support 10 students to attend and present their research at MIPS XIX. To date, 122 students have been awarded scholarships. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success. The meeting brings together diverse researchers investigating the process of extracting diagnostic information from medical images to render accurate and efficient diagnostic decisions. Opportunities for advanced, interdisciplinary training of young scientists interested in medical image perception research and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment are often quite limited at the university level. Since 1997, 122 trainees have been awarded MIPS scholarships, having a significant impact on the field by creating opportunities and offering supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success as independent basic science and clinician-scientist researchers.",Medical Image Perception Society XIX Conference,10235401,R13EB031602,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Engineering ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Malpractice ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', "" Physician's Role "", ' Physicians ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Scholarship ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Modern Medicine ', ' radiologist ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' car accident ', ' automobile accident ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical practice ', ' imaging system ', ' diagnostic screening ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R13,2021,10000,GA-05
"Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center (Overall Application) Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center - Overview Project Summary Musculoskeletal disorders remain an enormous public healthcare problem, accounting for more than fifty percent of chronic conditions in developed countries. The current financial landscape not only challenges investigator- led scientific programs, but particularly threatens collaborative research because lack of flexibility in individual budgets restricts resources and ability to share valuable techniques with our scientific neighbors. The Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center (MiMHC) enables vertically integrated, multi-scale musculoskeletal science from molecular and omic-level mechanisms to organismal function and clinical outcomes by increasing access to critical, specialized resources and expertise that are fundamental to the musculoskeletal research programs of 90 Center investigators. The MiMHC is structured to be consistent with initiatives at the University of Michigan aimed at promoting collaborations across disciplines and between basic scientists and clinicians to promote health by better understanding disease and injury mechanisms. The MiMHC not only enhances the capabilities of a group of outstanding musculoskeletal researchers but also leverages their collective talent through an Enrichment Program that promotes novel and emerging musculoskeletal research in cross-tissue interactions and sex-specific differences throughout the life course. An outreach program creates a rich community of musculoskeletal scientists through a novel monthly seminar series that builds on existing momentum toward accelerating discussion, critical thinking, research rigor and reproducibility, and innovation. To accomplish these goals, an Administrative Core will oversee core operations and three Resource Cores to provide Structure, Composition, and Histology services, Functional assessment services, and Integrative Data Analytics services to all members of the MiMHC research community. The Resource Cores are structured to facilitate hierarchically mechanistic studies from the molecular and omic-levels through the organ-level and to the clinical setting. Access to the Resource Cores has been and will continue to be financially and scientifically impactful to Center investigators by centralizing core technologies and by providing access to Core Directors who are experts in their field and who will provide guidance on the best choice of technologies, experimental design, and data interpretation. The UM environment is ideal for continuing to build a strong research community and to sustain an innovative, collaborative venture aimed at advancing understanding of musculoskeletal health and disease and to conduct science highly relevant to the NIAMS mission.

"Studying pseudogout using natural language processing and novel imaging approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (FROM FUNDED PARENT K23 APPLICATION) Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE (FROM FUNDED PARENT K23 APPLICATION) The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using natural language processing and novel imaging approaches,10292824,K23AR075070,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Award ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Pseudogout ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rheumatology ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P30 Protein ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunology ', ' career ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' instructor ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' phonoarthrography ', ' skeletal muscle ultrasound ', ' skeletal sonography ', ' musculoskeletal ultrasound ', ' Manuscripts ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Flare ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' musculoskeletal imaging ', ' musculoskeletal scanning ', ' musculoskeletal visualization ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' stem ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' crystallinity ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,54000,MA-07
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory

"Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites Abstract/Summary Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) outrank infectious diseases in terms of public health burden. Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death worldwide. In this application we will explore the genomic risk for common CMD, including hypertension, stroke, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and kidney disease, and related traits (including BMI, blood pressure, lipid, glucose, insulin and creatine) across populations with African ancestry (AA). There is evidence to suggest that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) translate poorly from a discovery study in one ancestral population (e.g. European Americans) to a target population (e.g. sub-Saharan Africans), especially when they are separated by large genetic differences. However, this has not been evaluated with large, well-powered AA datasets. Furthermore, the high genetic diversity and population structure among non-European Ancestry (EA) populations need to be investigated to understand the performance of PRSs in other regions populated by people with diverse genomic backgrounds. We bring together the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Consortium (H3Africa), other African, Jamaican and African American core cohorts, to develop a joint resource of over 50,000 participants with relevant phenotype and genomics data, referred to as the CARdiometabolic Disorders IN African-ancestry PopuLations (CARDINAL) Study Site. In addition, the CARDINAL Study Site will include 5 replication cohorts with >100,000 participants from diverse ancestry populations. Our main objective is to establish a Study Site for PRS Methods and Analysis for AA Populations and to collaboratively generate and refine PRS for other populations of diverse ancestry by integrating existing datasets with genomics and phenotype data for a range of complex diseases and traits. Our first aim is to integrate phenotype and genomic datasets from ~50,000 African individuals from seven individual cohort studies. Subsequently, we will evaluate PRSs and develop a novel method that takes into consideration, ancestry-specific genomic regions to improve prediction of PRSs in populations characterised by genetic sub-structure. Finally, we will develop an interactive dashboard for dissemination of PRS-related data from diverse ancestry populations. CARDINAL Study Site is ideal for generating novel biologic insights into complex disease etiology, with applications in global populations. Members of the CARDINAL team have successfully worked together for about a decade, generating and disseminating scientific knowledge through high impact publications. By establishing a Study Site in the Polygenic Risk Score Diversity Consortium, CARDINAL brings the largest cohort of African-ancestry participants to the table, to explore the genomics contribution to common CMDs and other NCDs. Narrative Cardiometabolic diseases are on the increase worldwide, contributing to high levels of morbidity and mortality, with limited resources among lower-resource populations in North America and Africa to prevent disease, make diagnosis and clinically manage patients. In this study we bring together ~50,000 African-ancestry participants (African American, Jamaicans and continental African) to form the CARDINAL study to assess and develop polygenic risk scores for cardiometabolic diseases and traits, and to develop analytic approaches for multi-ethnic cohorts leveraging the increased genetic diversity and lower linkage disequilibrium in African genomes.

"Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer Project Summary In 2010, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and D.E. Shaw Research (DESRES) partnered to make the Anton special-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) supercomputer available to the national biomedical research community for the first time. Anton enabled researchers to simulate biomolecular systems two orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer, allowing researchers access to critical multi- microsecond and longer timescales on which most biologically-significant molecular processes take place. In 2016, with operational support from NIH, DESRES made available a next generation Anton 2 system at PSC at no cost. This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions by simulating systems as large as 700,000 atoms at a rate of multiple microseconds per day. The goal of this renewal project is to provide the national biomedical research community with continued access to this unique and powerful Anton 2 resource and to maximize the benefit of this resource to the community. Since 2010, PSC has supported 589 research projects conducted by 202 unique PIs on the Anton systems hosted at PSC. So far, these projects have resulted in 292 publications, many of which have had significant impact on their fields of research. These fields cover the entire spectrum of biomolecular processes that form the fundamental underpinnings of biology, including protein folding, ion channel selectivity and gating, membrane dynamics and organization, protein- ligand binding, and many others. Demand for Anton 2 is quite high, with 2-3x higher demand than can be met each year. Given this, our goals are focused not only on providing continued access but also on maximizing the value of this limited resource to the community—recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse Anton 2 research community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation. Anton 2 will be integrated as an XSEDE service provider, and the accessibility and impact of Anton 2 will significantly increase by engaging in their extensive broadening participation, outreach, and training programs. Through these outreach efforts, researchers at many more institutions will have the opportunity to use Anton 2, especially researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups in biomedical research. The hundreds of long-timescale MD trajectories researchers generate on Anton 2 constitute a unique and valuable dataset that can be used to gain additional biomedical knowledge and advance the application of machine learning protocols to augment molecular dynamics simulations. This important dataset will be available to researchers and educators worldwide through a web portal and co-located on the PSC's Bridges-2 system for classroom instruction and research, including reanalysis, machine learning, and data mining. Project Narrative The Anton 2 supercomputer made available at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through this award will enable researchers to simulate biomolecular systems orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer. This powerful resource will enable biomedical researchers to better understand the fundamental biomolecular processes of biology, leading to better ways to treat disease and improve quality of life.",Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer,10211715,R01GM116961,"['Academy ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community Education ', ' Creativeness ', ' creativity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' United States National Academy of Sciences ', ' National Academy of Sciences ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' National Research Council ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' price lists ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' supercomputer ', ' outreach ', ' outreach program ', ' Gifts ', ' Institution ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Supercomputing ', ' super computing ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' anxious ', ' broadening participation research ', ' Broadening Participation ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' Data Science ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' service providers ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' archived data ', ' ']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,408856,PA-18
"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression. Developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. The proposed work will identify disease phenotypes in knee OA that will allow for the assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effect in clinical trials and ultimately lead to the development of targeted interventions and therapies.",Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression,10208726,K01AR075879,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old

"Institutional Career Development Core The KL2 Mentored Clinical Scholars Program attracts a diverse group of highly talented junior faculty across multiple disciplines from across Yale University (Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Science) who will pursue careers in T1-T4 translational research. This Program has been extremely successful, attracting 151 Scholars who have authored >5200 publications, have been PIs on 258 NIH grants, and have received a total of $557 million in grant funding. Remarkably, 99% of our KL2 Scholars have attained positions in academia, industry or public health conducting, and often with leadership responsibilities for, clinical and translational research. We aim to build on this success by providing Scholars with individualized, competency-based training in translational research that prepares them to contribute to the learning healthcare system, to advance personalized health, and to address health disparities. This preparation includes training in clinical trials, big data, machine learning, bioinformatics, multidisciplinary translational research, team science, implementation science and community-based participatory research. It also introduces them to regulatory issues, bioethics, Good Clinical Practices, and factors that drive rigor, transparency, and replicability. The KL2 promotes the development of relevant competencies among the Scholars by providing: 1) opportunities to work successfully in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research teams, 2) access to mentorship by senior mentors and recent Clinical Scholars, 3) externships in industry, public health and regulatory agencies, and 4) intensive training in grant-writing and in multidisciplinary team science. To oversee these diverse, highly motivated junior investigators, we have an educational leadership team of: 1) three outstanding investigator mentors who work in different areas of translational research, 2) an experienced Diversity Officer, and 3) an expert in evaluating and dynamically reshaping medical education programs. This leadership team has used feedback from prior Scholars and their mentors to add new initiatives to the already successful program. We expanded our logic model to implement social network analyses to track the activities of the Scholars, and we will expand the curriculum to include a new course. That course will mix Scholars and TL-1 trainees who will work in teams as they get formal training and peer mentoring in a variety of areas such as big data/machine learning, diversity and inclusion, and running a research laboratory. With these additions to an already strong curriculum, we believe that the Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program will be ideally positioned to train the next generation of leaders in T1-T4 translational research who will transform healthcare in ways that alleviate the burden of disease and improve health in the US and around the world. The Specific Aims of the KL2 are: Aim 1: The Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program: To provide a program comprised of a mentored research experience, coursework, and seminars that are intended to promote the emergence of scientific independence and the career development of talented young T1-T4 translational scientist Scholars. Aim 2: The Yale Masters in Health Science Program: To provide those M.D. Scholars who do not possess an advanced research degree with additional coursework and scholarly activities to qualify for a Masters in Health Science (MHS) to address limitations in their scientific preparation for a research career.

"Dominance on the human genome and non-additive polygenic models for predicting complex traits Project Abstract Dominance is one of the most fundamental concepts in genetics and has many key implications in population genetics, as it ultimately determines how selection manifests in a population. However, despite its unarguable importance, dominance is also one of the least characterized quantities in genetics, especially in humans, with the major challenge being current methods cannot distinguish dominance from the fitness effect of genomic variants. This proposed K99/R00 work will systematically address this longstanding problem from a dual- perspectives, by inferring dominance in humans and quantitatively model its role in shaping the phenotypes of complex traits and diseases. Specifically, in Aim1, I will develop a powerful machine learning-based method to infer the realistic distribution of dominance on the human genome in megabase-scale, leveraging archaic introgressed ancestry in non-African populations that is sensitive to dominance variation in genomic regions. In Aim 2, I will develop non-additive polygenic models accounting for dominance in full genomic regions to identify complex traits profiled in UK Biobank that deviate from additive models, improve the accuracy of phenotype and disease risk predictions, and contribute to an in-depth understanding of complex trait biology. Finally, in Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will extend these approaches to infer dominance variation in worldwide populations and investigate how dominance, combined with selection and admixture, determines complex trait phenotypes in diverse human populations. The mentored phase of this work will take place at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UCLA, where Dr. Zhang will have access to rich training opportunities and be supported by active scientific communities, including numerous seminar series, journal clubs, and networking activities. Dr. Kirk Lohmueller (primary mentor) and Dr. Sriram Sankararaman (co-mentor) will train Dr. Zhang in computational and statistical methods in population genetics, machine learning applications, and large-scale disease association data analysis. The research trainings, collaborations, and professional development during the K99 phase will assist Dr. Zhang in becoming an independent investigator in human population genetics. Project Narrative Dominance plays a vital role in human evolutionary genetics both in terms of its fitness effect on functional genomic variants and how it shapes complex trait phenotypes, while its distribution on the human genome and biological effects on complex traits are poorly characterized. This work will fill a critical knowledge gap by producing a complete picture of dominance distribution in humans, which will shed a light into many unsolved questions in genetics, including the evolution of dominance. This work will further provide comprehensive statistical frameworks to model the relationship between dominance and complex trait phenotypes, which will substantially improve the transferability of biomedical applications in historically understudied populations, including disease risk prediction and the development of precision medicine.",Dominance on the human genome and non-additive polygenic models for predicting complex traits,10283330,K99GM143466,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demography ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Bionomics ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Evolution ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' human population genetics ', ' trait ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Study Subject ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Admixture ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' training opportunity ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2021,82828,CA-33
"POR and Training Program on Multidrug-Resistant Organisms ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most pressing public health priorities. AMR is thought to be re- sponsible for more than 35,000 deaths in the US with a projection of 300 million deaths worldwide by 2050. My original K24 application sought to increase my ability to conduct patient oriented research (POR) on antibiotic resistance and mentor a new generation of clinicians scientists on different aspects of this important public health threat. With support from the K24 award, I was able to markedly increase my research portfolio, launch a microbial genomics mission and increase my mentoring activities. Thus, the overarching goal of this com- petitive K24 renewal is to fully transition to an established investigator by continuing and further strengthening my POR portfolio and mentoring abilities. I also aim to fortify my leadership skills to expand an ambitious re- search and training program, focused on AMR. Supported in part by my original K24 award, I founded the Cen- ter for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics (CARMiG) at UTHealth. The vision of CARMiG was to amalgamate the world-class expertise available in the Houston’s Texas Medical Center (TMC) to serve as a major platform for cutting edge research programs and integrate a training mission to the highest level. I also led the creation of the Gulf Coast Consortium on Antimicrobial Resistance (GCC-AMR), an inter-institutional hub for AMR researchers across the TMC to interact and foster collaborations. We developed a robust training program on AMR, recruiting and supporting the career of a diverse pool of trainees (MD, PhDs and PharmDs) at different stages of their careers. My trainees have secured 4 NIH K developments awards (2 with perfect scores), and equivalent independent grants. Furthermore, the number of trainee’s publications has markedly expanded (94 publications as firs/corresponding author). Our NIH grant portfolio also grew with more than $ 20 million brought in as PI of NIH grants in the last 5 years, including a recent P01 program ($11m). We were also able to secure the first post-doctoral inter-institutional T32 training program on AMR. Thus, the foundations of my initial K24 program put me in an ideal position to sustain and further strengthen my research and training objectives. In my original K24 program I focused on the clinical and genomic aspects of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) one of the most challenging organisms in clinical settings. Using the expertise acquired in VRE, my K24 renewal will support new areas of research, including the intersection of microbiome science and AMR, genomics and molecular epidemiology of Gram-negative pathogens and use of machine learning to es- tablish clinical/genomic correlates in patients infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). The spe- cific aims are: i) strengthen my portfolio of POR related to AMR as the foundation for trainees to develop their careers, and ii) mentor talented young investigators in translational and POR focused on AMR. I plan to con- tinue my robust mentoring program that integrates the understanding of the molecular and genomic bases of resistance and their translation into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a top public-health priority.

"Center for Live Cell Genomics ABSTRACT Center for Live Cell Genomics We will build new methodology and capacity for large-scale, long-term, inexpensive, modular, customizable, shared, Internet-of-Things-controlled, reproducible live cell culture and tissue-based experimental genomics disease models. Tissue models include traditional cell culture as well as organoid and primary tissue explants obtained from surgery or biopsy. Organoid factories supporting tissue growth and maintenance will be integrated with external and on-chip electro-optofluidic analytical modules to become part of an ecosystem that is modeled after open-source software. It will use commodity sensors, cameras, and computers linked in platforms flexibly designed using simple 3D printing, molding, etching and milling techniques potentially available at any institution. This will stimulate rapid innovation in experimental platforms for tissue culture. We will push this technology and use its best-in-class capabilities to make progress in neurodevelopment and pediatric cancer, addressing big questions. What genes contribute most importantly and specifically to human brain development? How do they go wrong in neurodevelopmental disease or brain injury? What specific molecular pathways are disrupted in individual pediatric cancer cases? How can we test pathway-specific treatments in a tissue model specific to each patient? Our education and outreach plans include a training program to develop a diverse and inclusive cohort of undergraduate students trained in genomic science through secondary school and community college outreach as well as coding workshops and research-based laboratory classes for UCSC undergraduates to develop core competencies. Participation in these activities serve as a basis for training graduate students and postdocs in inclusive pedagogy and mentorship. We are also developing a one-stop information hub to form an online community and to share our technology through immersive webinars and tutorials aimed at a broader audience with a range of expertise from the general public to scientists and clinicians at research institutions. Our work will enable significant advances in neuroscience and cancer research and education, stimulate a new open-source culture in cell biology and genomics, and democratize scientific and educational access beyond elite institutions, extending sharing projects like NHGRI ANvIL beyond data and code to include experiments and Internet-connected experimental platforms. Project Narrative We will introduce a new experimental platform paradigm to genomic studies of live cells and tissues that will allow scientists to be more creative, more productive, more collaborative and use fewer resources for their live cell genomics experiments. We will create new platforms that provide living cells growing in realistic 3D cultures that mimic actual tissues in the body and incorporate Internet-based remote control and analysis capabilities. We will deploy this technology to perform new, more robust and more reproducible experiments leading to discoveries in neurodevelopmental disease and cancer.",Center for Live Cell

"Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Project Summary/Abstract  The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have enabled the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of disease phenotypes, at the tissue and even the single cell level. This has allowed development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients. Thus, new genomic science educational initiatives need to be continually updated to educate the clinical and translational workforce on how to effectively interpret and apply the findings from genomics studies. Patients of providers who have participated in these educational initiatives also benefit as it allows for more rapid integration of genomic study findings into the clinical care setting. Thus, in response to PAR-19-185, we propose to develop and implement the Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) program that will not only focus on the analysis of genomic data, but also on gene-expression data, the integration of these two data types, as well as introductory theory and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Specifically we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Develop and successfully implement the online and in-person phases of CREiGS to increase the methodologic ingenuity by which researchers tackle important genomics-related clinical problems. 2. Establish a Diversity Recruitment External Advisory Board to ensure that the most effective strategies are employed to recruit URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from academic institutions nationwide into CREiGS. 3. Enhance the dissemination phase of CREiGS by packaging and uploading the asynchronous lectures and the online critical thinking/problem solving assessments with solutions for publicly available, online teaching resources. 4. Implement effective methods to evaluate the efficacy of CREiGS by examining:1) the participants' grasp of the CREiGS core competencies, 2) the clarity and quality of the curriculum, 3) program logistics and operation, and 4) the participants' short-term and long-term success attributed to participation in CREiGS. In summary, we posit that CREiGS will provide participants with a solid foundation in genomics science to answer complex, clinical questions. We believe that CREiGS supports the mission of the NHGRI by providing researchers with rigorous training to “accelerate medical breakthroughs that improve human health.” Project Narrative The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have allowed for the development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients.

"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied.

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,10137788,K23AR075070,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', '

"Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders supports a full day of presentations by leading scientists in areas that are having transformational effects in the communication sciences and disorders (CSD) discipline. The Research Symposium is held at the annual Convention of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and is open to all of the approximately 15,000 Convention attendees, which includes students, practitioners, and researchers. Following Convention, the Symposium content is widely disseminated through audio recordings of the presentations, which are synced with the slides and transcribed, and by making them freely accessible on the ASHA website. Additionally, each presenter submits an article based on their presentation to the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research to be published in the annual Research Symposium Forum. An innovation that will be implemented in this current funding cycle is that ASHA will make these articles freely accessible upon publication on the ASHA Journals website and will deposit them in PubMed Central without embargo. The first aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance scientific discourse and dissemination of scientific discovery and innovation on five topics that are having transformational effects across several subareas in CSD. This will be accomplished, in part, by making the Research Symposium Forum open access and by widely promoting both the recorded and the written content across ASHA’s many communication channels. Over the next 5-year funding cycle, the Symposium will address five topics that cut across the areas of hearing, speech, language, and other aspects of cognition, including (1) Health and Healthcare Equity of People With Communication Disabilities, (2) Bilingualism, (3) Artificial Intelligence in CSD, (4) Genetics in CSD, and (5) Intervention and Implementation Clinical Trials in CSD. The second aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance the research career development of early- career scientists focused on research in CSD. Between 2021 and 2025, the Research Mentoring- Pair Travel Award and ASHA’s in-kind contribution will provide funding to attend the Symposium and mentoring support to 130 early-career scientists in CSD. The Travel Award recipients will attend the Symposium along with a mentor and engage in mentored research activities before, during, and after each Symposium. These activities are designed to help integrate the protégés into their scientific community and encourage them to pursue a research career and become productive scholars. The scientific base of the CSD discipline will be strengthened by these scientific dissemination, research education, and mentoring activities. The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders aims to strengthen the scientific base and increase the research capacity of the discipline, which will lead to improvements in the communication health of millions people with communication or related disorders. The Symposium presentations will advance the scientific dialogue and be broadly disseminated through freely available peer-reviewed publications and transcribed recordings. The associated Travel Award will provide funds to support 130 promising early-career scientists in attending the Research Symposium and engaging in mentored research activities before, during, after the Symposium to increase their recruitment and retention in a research career.",Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders,10070224,R13DC003383,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Speech ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' American Speech-Language-Hearing Association ', ' Generations ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Discipline ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Slide ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Reporting ', ' Communication Disability ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' PubMed ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctorate Degree ', ' doctoral degree ', "" Doctor's Degree "", ' health communication ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Seminal ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' dissemination research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' stem ', ' doctoral student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,10086862,K25DK115904,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Barrett Esophagus ', ' Barrett Syndrome ', ' Barrett Ulcer ', ' Columnar Epithelial-Lined Lower Esophagus ', ' Columnar-Lined Esophagus ', ' esophageal intestinal metaplasia ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Esophagitis ', ' Esophagus ', ' Exhibits ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' IL-1 β ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1β ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL1-β ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1β ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' Interleukin-1β ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Competence ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' career ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology Parent award: OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. Parent award: OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.",Center of Excellence in Environmental

"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all.

"NNLM Center for Data Science and Delivery of Data Services National Center for Data Science Abstract Scientific progress is impeded when researchers lack the knowledge and skills to engage in effective data management, reproducible research practices, and meaningful data sharing. A growing number of librarians are providing support for best practices in data management and data science, but there is still tremendous untapped potential across the library community. The Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM) Center for Data Science and Delivery of Data Services (NCDS) will coordinate national efforts to provide training and resources to increase capacity among librarians to support two of the National Library of Medicine’s strategic goals: 1) accelerate discovery and advance health by providing the tools for data-driven research, and 2) build a workforce for data-driven research and health. The NCDS team brings a broad set of data skills to this undertaking, as well as experience in successful development of institutional data support and in developing resources for, training, and mentoring librarians on the national level. The NCDS will work collaboratively with the NNLM’s Regional Medical Libraries, Offices and Centers (ROCs), draw upon extensive connections with national data organizations to increase outreach and partner on programming, and assemble an external advisory board with expertise in clinical informatics, bioinformatics, community engagement, machine learning, data ethics, and open science to solicit feedback on our efforts and to maintain awareness of a breadth of current data issues. The NCDS will partner with the National Evaluation Center (NEC) to better understand the needs of the communities we are serving, ensure that training, resources, and support are designed and delivered in ways that meet those needs, generate information on best practices, and evaluate the achievement of the program aims. The proposed education programs will emphasize careful curation of existing content over “reinventing the wheel” in order to build resources such as an online Data Roadmap for self-directed learning and a repository of curricular resources. The NCDS will also focus on support for knowledge application and consolidation, offering courses with coaching to assist in bringing knowledge into practice and training in coding followed by codeathons to consolidate knowledge. Other programming will include a series of unconferences to support community building and development of resources. We will develop a pipeline program to provide data librarianship internships to Library and Information Science and college students from communities currently underrepresented in the profession. The NCDS will take advantage of multiple channels to communicate, including website, blogs, and social media, as well as collaborating with the ROCs and external partner organizations for outreach. The NCDS will use a coordinated, data-driven, innovative approach, to build capacity for providing data services among health information professionals, and in this way facilitate efficient and reproducible research and promote greater collaboration.

"A Data and Administrative Coordinating Center for the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The goals of the IGVF Data Administrative and Coordinating Center (DACC) are to support the IGVF Consortium by defining and establishing a strategy that connects all participants to the project’s science. By creating avenues of access that distribute these data to the greater biological research community, the DACC provides a critical connection between scientific producers and consumers. The IGVF Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via novel experimental assays, often focusing at the single-cell level of gene expression. This work is extended and regularized by laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover the associations and networks between human variation, chromosomal elements and molecular phenotypes for the purpose of elucidating their complex relationship in human cells and tissues. The DACC’s participation enhances the data created by the consortium through the creation of structured procedures for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created, the DACC will construct a state of the art data warehouse, design and develop robust software to enable data submission, and harden unified data processing pipelines. All experimental and computational results will be made available via the IGVF Portal, developed by the DACC. The Portal will integrate these data resources and provide enhanced search and browsing capabilities, along with powerful web services. The DACC will develop tools for semantically-enhanced graph-based searches of experiment metadata, individual genomic elements, variation and phenotype, and will implement methods to distribute these results in matrices suitable for machine learning. Beyond computational infrastructure to house and distribute consortium data, the DACC will also function as the administrative hub of the IGVF. Consortium science thrives on clear and forthright communication between its component parts, and it is the DACC’s responsibility to manage this relationship. This effort will be facilitated by management of consortium working groups, organization of scientific results and publications, and providing regular reporting and feedback to the Steering committee. To fully support the community, the DACC will act as a service organization, allowing biomedical research to take full advantage of the results from the IGVF. To this end, the DACC will organize and host consortium- focused and user-focused meetings, and will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The various component projects of the IGVF (DACC, mapping, systematic characterization, genetic network regulation, modeling of genomic variation centers and groups) will be tightly woven together to create the IGVF Consortium. Relevance to Public Health, Project Narrative Through this project we will create a Data Administration and Coordinating Center (DACC) for the NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation and Function (IGVF), which promises to transform our understanding of the associations between genetic variation and phenotype. Our proposed DACC will serve as the primary administration, communication, outreach and data center for IGVF awardees and provide leadership for standards and processing pipeline implementation, and facilitate FAIR databases and software. Due to our cross-cutting and unparalleled technical expertise in data management, genomics, informatics, network analysis, and privacy-preserving application as well as our role leading a large data coordination center, managing, coordinating data and metadata, as well as creating gold standard knowledgebases, Stanford is in a strong position to serve as the IGVF DACC.",A Data and Administrative Coordinating Center for the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function Consortium,10296944,U24HG012012,"['Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Students ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' scientific organization ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' distributed data ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' computer infrastructure ', ' computational infrastructure ', ' verification and validation ', ' genomic variation ', ' social media ', ' webinar ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' cloud storage ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' data resource ', ' service organization ', ' data warehouse ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' data centers ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' complex data ', ' privacy preservation ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' implementation facilitation ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,2739389,CA-18
"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,10251876,R01HG010749,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' file format ', ' data sharing ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,526482,CT-03

"The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD) PROJECT SUMMARY The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a major public health and clinical challenge in the United States. Identification of ADRD causes to inform prevention and policy is the most efficient way to address these challenges. Most research to date has focused on identifying genetic causes of ADRD, however, recent population-scale studies have shown that environmental exposures, such as lead and cadmium, also contribute to ADRD risk and etiology. Initial findings on environmental factors linked to ADRD risk is promising, but human evidence is limited. A wide range of environmental exposures (exposome) have never been evaluated systematically in relation to incident ADRD. While there is a growing demand to predict future risk for ADRS more precisely, the role of exposomic data in improving ADRD risk prediction has never been evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a prospective cohort study by capitalizing on existing large-scale, United States nationally representative, multi-ethnic population-based data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, from 1998-2010, n>15,000) has a variety of environmental chemical exposure measurements, behavioral risk factors, and clinical phenotypes, and when linked to Medicare data, provides up to 25 years of incident ADRD. We aim to (1) conduct a biologic hypothesis-based approach to test the associations of chronic exposure to lead and cadmium with incident ADRD; (2) conduct a data-driven environment-wide association study to systematically evaluate a wide-range of environmental toxicants with incident ADRD; and (3) develop and validate an exposome-based risk prediction model for ADRD using machine learning methods. The proposed study will advance scientific understanding on how modifiable and currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants can lead to the development of ADRD. This study assesses the exposome to improve prediction of future disease risk and define vulnerable populations more precisely. This research will highlight individual-level and population-level interventions (i.e. precision health) to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of ADRD in the US population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health and precision health because comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of modifiable environmental exposures, including the currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants lead and cadmium, will advance scientific understanding on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and inform individual-level and population-level interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the burden of ADRD. The proposed study is directly responsive to the 2018 National Institute on Aging AD Research Summit recommendations related to Understanding the Impact of the Environment to Advance Disease Prevention and Enabling Precision Medicine Research for AD/ADRD, and to the research goal of NOT-AG-18-053, Enabling precision medicine for AD/ADRD through deep molecular phenotyping.",The Study of

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,10120729,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' clinical outcome measures ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,186408,CA-18
"OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function Project summary Over the past five years, the Allen Institute has built two unique in-house pipelines for in vivo electro- and optical-physiology: together they form the Allen Brain Observatory. We used this observatory to freely and openly share calcium imaging data from ~60,000 cells from 221 running mice viewing standard visual stimuli; in October 2019, we will release Neuropixels electrophysiology recordings from ~100,000 cells from 100 mice under the same conditions, all registered to a common anatomical coordinate system (CCFv3). We wish to open the Brain Observatory pipeline to the community, enabling theoretical, computational, and experimental scientists to test sophisticated hypotheses on brain functions in a process analogous to astronomical observatories that survey the night sky. Our observatory, called OpenScope, will accept, once a year, experimental proposals from external scientists, which will be reviewed by a panel of leading experts for their feasibility and scientific merit. The Allen Institute will carry out the selected experiments by following verified, reproducible, and open protocols for in vivo single- and multi-area two photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels electrophysiology, making the data freely available to these scientists. Funding for this proposal will give the entire community access to a modern experimental platform that operates under standardized, reproducible, and high-throughput conditions. This resource will be particularly attractive to the computational and theoretical communities with limited access to experimental facilities. Our project has the potential to transform systems neuroscience by implementing an observatory model that has been tremendously successful in other scientific fields. By reducing variability in training, imaging and quality control across animals and experiments and by lowering the barrier to select, test, and validate the best ideas, we hope to accelerate progress toward an integrated view of neural circuits. Project narrative Scientific fields such as astronomy and particle physics have had tremendous success using an “observatory” based approach to data collection, in which researchers propose experiments to be carried out in centralized facilities too complex and expensive to be operated by individual laboratories. We will apply this model to neuroscience by opening the Allen Institute Brain Observatory’s state-of-the-art optical and electrophysiological data collection pipelines to the entire neuroscience community. This will lower barriers to testing new hypotheses about brain function, bring in new computational and theoretical talents into the field, and enhance the reproducibility of results in brain research, thereby accelerating progress toward an integrated understanding of neural activity in health and disease.",OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function,9967446,U24NS113646,"['Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' success ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' implantation ', ' brain research ', ' data format ', ' cloud based ', ' imaging platform ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' particle physics ', ' flavor physics ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Astronomy ', ' space science ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Incentives ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Physiology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' falls ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' ']",NINDS,ALLEN INSTITUTE,U24,2021,1501246,WA-07
"An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology Hazardous pollutants in the environment continue to threaten public health and environmental  safety. Human exposure to major contaminant classes, such as polyfluorinated compounds  (PFCs), hazardous organic compounds (HOCs), and heavy metals, has been linked to a variety of  diseases and is subject to stringent State and Federal environmental regulations.  Bioremediation is a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach with many successful  use-cases; however, conventional bioremediation technologies can suffer from unreliability, low  degradation rates, and incomplete degradation. As stakeholders to Superfund sites and other sites  with water or soil pollution urgently demand more efficient, less costly and more reliable  remediation technologies, it is critical to look to advancements in computational  modeling to develop next-generation, precision-engineered bioremediation technologies. The proposed project builds on successful outcomes from Phase I in which a new computational  platform was designed and validated to accurately predict the bioremediation kinetics of  a multi-organism microcosm degrading a combination of HOCs in groundwater. The basis of  this platform is an approach called agent-based modeling (ABM), where the functions of  individual components (e.g. microorganisms) within complex ecosystems are used to predict and  optimize system-level properties (e.g. bioremediation kinetics). In this Phase II project, the novel computational platform developed in Phase I is  further improved with a machine learning component that leverages bioinformatics  databases to develop rationally tailored microbiomes for degrading complex pollutant  mixtures. Iterative experimental validation of model outputs is conducted using an innovative  materials science platform that maintains the relative concentration of different species in the  microbiome constant within the multi-zone treatment barrier (in-situ) or multi-zone bioreactor  (ex-situ). The project includes focused development of a prototype for one bioremediation use-case,  which is directly compared to a conventional (non-precision) bioremediation system treating   actual contaminated groundwater. This will be performed in order to assess and quantify  the expected technical and economic benefits of harnessing the project's novel computational  platform in biotechnology development. The broad, long-term impact of the proposed project will be to transform the development and  implementation of bioremediation by integrating advancements in computational modeling, machine  learning, bioinformatics, and materials science. By leveraging novel tools across disciplines, the  project will accelerate the development of more precise, reliable and inexpensive technologies for  environmental remediation. The successful outcome of the proposed project will also provide new  collaborative opportunities for industry and academia to more rapidly address the remediation of  high-priority pollutants in the environment, and ultimately help mitigate the effects of hazardous  pollutants on communities impacted by the presence of environmental contamination.

"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,10167757,U24HG003345,"['Biology ', ' Cattle ', ' Bovine Species ', ' bovid ', ' bovine ', ' cow ', ' Chickens ', ' Gallus domesticus ', ' Gallus gallus ', ' Gallus gallus domesticus ', ' Communication ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' P450 ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Family ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Gene Duplication ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Glutathione S-Transferase ', ' EC 2.5.1.18 ', ' Glutathione Organic Nitrate Ester Reductase ', ' Glutathione S-Alkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aralkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aryltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Epoxidetransferase ', ' Glutathione Transferase ', ' Heme Transfer Protein ', ' Ligandins ', ' S-Hydroxyalkyl Glutathione Lyase ', ' glutathione aralkyltransferase ', ' glutathione aryltransferase ', ' Goals ', ' Equus caballus ', ' Domestic Horse ', ' Equine ', ' Equine Species ', ' Equus przewalskii ', ' Horses ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Manuals ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' detoxification ', ' Study models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudogenes ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' Glucuronic Transferase ', ' Glucuronyltransferase ', ' UDP Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' UDP Glucuronyl Transferase ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Work ', ' Xenopus ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,10198898,K08DE027720,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Health Services ', ' Dentists ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' decision tree learning ', ' econometrics ', ' multiple data sources ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2021,130317,MA-07
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis. NARRATIVE This project will provide infrastructure support for a cutting edge program of research on population dynamics at the Carolina Population Center. Research at the Center will analyze state-of-the art data to address fundamental questions regarding fertility, adolescent health, and links between the environment and health.

"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics,10136665,R01HG007352,"['Algorithms ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Crete ', ' Cytology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Lamin Type B ', ' Lamin B ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Nuclear ', ' insertion element ', ' insertion sequence ', ' DNA Insertion Elements ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Nuclear Lamina ', ' Temporal DNA Replication Order ', ' Temporal DNA Replication Pattern ', ' DNA Replication Timing ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' comparative genomics ', ' mental function ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Visualization ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,345658,PA-18
"Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis PROJECT SUMMARY This overall goal of this mentored patient-oriented research career development award is to improve our understanding of pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Dr. Barnes is a motivated clinical researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), with a specific interest in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases. Over the next five years, Dr. Barnes will work with his mentorship committee to continue his progression towards his goal of independence. His mentorship committee includes experts in gastrointestinal epidemiology and comparative effectiveness (Kappelman), patient reported outcomes [(PROs) DeWalt], and precision medicine (Kosorok). Each member has an established track record of mentoring junior faculty, consistent peer-reviewed support, and high research productivity. Dr. Barnes’s career development objectives are as follows: 1) develop a new skillset in comparative effectiveness research using real-world data; 2) obtain knowledge and experience in the development of PRO assessments; 3) acquire new skills in machine learning and precision medicine principles which will allow for the incorporation of clinical and microbiota data into new risk modeling for patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, and 4) transition to independence. To achieve his career development objectives, Dr. Barnes will participate in structured coursework, conduct mentored research, and will participate in workshops through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, including the R-Writing Group. The research and training environment at UNC is well established. For fiscal year 2019, UNC ranked tenth among both private and public universities nationwide for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding to domestic institutions of higher education. The specific aims of this research project are 1) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific biologic therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pouch after IPAA; 2) to develop PRO items for evaluating quality of life and specific symptom domains among patients after IPAA. Techniques for PRO development will include identifying symptom domains relevant to patients after IPAA using qualitative research methods, selecting candidate items for IPAA-specific PROs using existing PRO instruments where appropriate, and performing cognitive interviews with patients after IPAA to ensure content validity; and 3) to demonstrate novel methods for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis using a machine learning approach. Expanding an existing prospective cohort, Dr. Barnes will utilize the stool microbiome, laboratory data and clinical variables to create signatures for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis. The combination of mentorship, didactics, and research experiences offered through this K23 proposal will allow Dr. Barnes to develop a unique skillset that will aid in his ultimate transition to independence as a clinical investigator and research scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the most common surgery for refractory ulcerative colitis and ulcerative colitis-related dysplasia, multiple complications can occur. Short and long-term complications include inflammatory conditions of the pouch such as acute and chronic pouchitis and Crohn’s-like disease of the pouch, each of which can require new medical treatments after surgery and can significantly impact the quality of life of individual patients. This mentored patient-oriented research career development project will generate evidence about the comparative effectiveness of therapies for the treatment of these inflammatory conditions of the pouch, will develop new IPAA-specific patient-reported assessments of pouch symptoms and quality of life, and will utilize precision medicine techniques including machine learning to identify patients at high-risk for developing chronic pouchitis.",Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis,10103883,K23DK127157,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Award ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colectomy ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Counseling ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's "", "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' Crowding ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Privatization ', ' Productivity ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Restorative Proctocolectomy ', ' Restorative Coloproctectomy ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Ileal Reservoirs ', ' Ileal Pouches ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', "" large bowel Crohn's disease "", "" Crohn's Colitis "", ' granulomatous colitis ', "" large intestine Crohn's disease "", ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy ', ' anti-TNF therapy ', ' anti-TNF-alpha therapy ', ' Inflammatory ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Dysplasia ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pouch Ileitis ', ' Pouchitis ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Anastomosis ', ' Anastomosis -

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand

"Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Career Development K12 Program PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overall objective of the NEI Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program Award at UCSD is to develop outstanding clinician scientists to successfully compete for NIH grants and emerge as leaders within academic ophthalmology. Through this institutional career development award, we will continue to mentor clinician scientists toward independent academic appointments in ophthalmology. Since 1991, the UC San Diego Shiley Eye Institute has excelled in mentoring the career development of clinician scientists throughout ophthalmology. Many of these individuals now have successful research and clinical careers around the world; they include Department Chairs, Division Chiefs, and impactful academicians. With continued funding, we will amplify these strengths through a structured program of mentoring, research, and education to identify and mentor the next generation of academic clinician scientists, across all subspecialty areas of ophthalmology. With an emphasis on recruiting strong applications from women and minority applicants, Scholars will be selected each year after their completion of a post-residency clinical fellowship in ophthalmology. The Scholar will undertake these activities in the area of basic and/or clinical sciences appropriate to their scientific focus, and by partnering with mentor(s) to facilitate career development. Each Scholar will be trained in clinically relevant research, statistics, scientific writing, grant preparation, ethics, leadership, and the responsible conduct of research. Additional aspects of the curriculum of each Scholar will be individualized by the Program Director (PI), Research Directors, Education Director, Executive Committee, Mentoring Group, and lead mentor based upon the Scholar's selected primary research track and his/her skills, background, and career goals. Each Scholar will create an original research program and through this Award develop an independent academic career. We propose six primary research tracks: (1) Visual Neuroscience, (2) Genomics and Proteomics, (3) Bioengineering, (4) Stem Cell Biology, (5) Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, and (6) Clinical (human subjects) Research. In the first K12 funding period, we trained and recruited four clinician scientists in the subspecialty areas of retina (2), glaucoma (1), and pediatric ophthalmology (1). Two of these Scholars already have received NIH K08 awards, and the other two have submitted K08 proposals that are under consideration.

"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics.

"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response.

"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.

"Development of novel computational protocols to study amyloid oligomerization Project Summary Dr. Viet Man is a biophysicist whose overarching career goal is to prevent the development of neurodegenerative diseases which are associated to the aggregation of amyloid proteins/peptides. He received his Ph.D. degree in physics from Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences (IFPAN). He completed two postdoctoral fellowships before joining the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at The University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy (PittPharmacy) as a scientist. The research proposal entitled “Development of Novel Computational Protocols to Study Amyloid Oligomerization” combines Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation integrated innovative system designs and special data analysis, advanced statistical methods and scientific programming development to investigate the oligomerization of amyloid proteins/peptides, to identify inhibitors for the formation of amyloid oligomers, and to establish theoretical bases for physical therapies that target the elimination of the toxic amyloid oligomers. The research proposal includes three aims: 1) investigate the oligomerization of amyloid proteins/peptides; 2) identify inhibitors for the formation of amyloid toxic oligomers from approved drugs and natural compounds; 3) study physical therapies for eliminating the toxic oligomers. The completion of these aims will reveal important insights of the amyloid oligomerization process, provide potential drugs and promising physical therapies for preventing the development of some diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer's disease, which are both associated to the amyloid oligomerization. The proposed career development plan is built upon his previous training with four training goals to enhance his trajectory toward becoming an independent investigator: 1) Experiential and didactic learning in experimental methods used for amyloid aggregation; 2) Acquire and apply advanced statistical analyses, machine learning as well as artificial intelligence; 3) Become an expert in force field and scientific program development; and 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to execute multicenter studies. Dr. Man and his primary mentor, Junmei Wang, Ph.D., have assembled a strong team of co-mentors and advisors to guide Dr. Viet through the proposed training and research activities.

"UCSF Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement ABSTRACT - OVERALL Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating estrogen-dependent disease wherein tissue similar to the uterine lining (endometrium) is found mainly on pelvic tissues and organs where it causes an inflammatory response, scarring, pelvic pain, and infertility. It affects millions of reproductive age women and severely impacts quality of life and professional life, and has a huge health economic impact of about $69B annually in the U.S. While its etiology is uncertain, profound dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems is associated with inefficient lesion clearance and pelvic and systemic inflammation. The heterogeneity of endometriosis lesions and disease phenotypes is reflected in variable pain symptom presentations, unpredictable fertility potential, uncertain disease pathophysiology, and unpredictable responses to medical therapies, symptom and disease recurrence after surgical resection, and risks for co-morbidities. Clinical classifications of endometriosis are maladapted to the heterogeneity of disease expression, and thus efficient treatments for associated pain symptoms are lacking. Herein, our UCSF Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement (“ENACT”) proposes a comprehensive systems biology and precision medicine approach to endometriosis. We propose to study endometriosis unmet needs and challenges through transdisciplinary collaboration and scientific and technologic innovations, integrating multi-omics data to dissect endometriosis disease mechanisms, identify phenotypic and environmental disease signatures, develop accurate disease stratification and diagnosis, and identify novel and repurposed drug classes to ameliorate pain symptoms. To achieve these goals, our Center is comprised of 3 independent and interactive projects and 2 Cores, focused on the central theme of Endometriosis Precision Medicine. Project 1 will focus on underlying immunological mechanisms in endometriosis pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Project 2 will address developing a multi- omic disease classification that will inform diagnostic strategies, and Project 3 will leverage existing and newly generated large-scale omic data to identify and validate new therapeutic interventions. Our long-standing Human Endometrial Tissue and DNA Bank and REDCap database and ongoing accruals with our collaborating network of surgeons will be a major resource for this Center's project. The Center will have an Administrative Core and an Education and Community Outreach Core that will engage students from the Bay Area in our research programs and empower women in our community and address health disparities associated with endometriosis. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University, many of whom are new to endometriosis research, as well as educators, trainees, and community representatives who are all committed to improve the lives of women and teen girls with endometriosis. Integrating multiple disciplines, fostering collaborations among those who are new to endometriosis, training the next generation and partnering with our community are key to the outcomes and impact of our Endometriosis Center.

"Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues This K99/R00 Award is designed to generate scholarship and interventions to guide genomics companies towards more just practices. It does so through a five-year training and research project, which investigates perspectives from members of the genomics industry, and leverages them to inform normative analyses and identify feasible paths towards concrete change. The project addresses issues of price, access and industrial control, with a focus on the ethics of profit and social responsibility. Through the proposed training program, the project prepares the candidate as an independent scholar whose research program links empirical and normative research with practical interventions to positively influence ethics and justice in private sector genomics. The first phase of research (conducted during the K phase, alongside training activities) is a comparative study examining social and cultural factors involved in perceptions of ethical issues among members of industry. The comparative study focuses on three biotech hubs in the US (the Bay Area, San Diego, and Boston), as well as an additional site in South Africa (Cape Town). The South African site helps place investigation of the US industry in light of a shifting global industry, and especially South Africa’s policy focus on genomics for population health (as well as its role in the H3Africa initiative). The study also considers industry subsector and individual company culture, in examining influences on industry approaches to social and ethical issues. During its R phase, the project then involves a systematic normative analysis of profit and social obligation in the genomics industry, based on key theories from bioethics and business ethics. The project will then feed this scholarly analysis back to industry stakeholders; using a Delphi study, it allows members of industry to use results of the normative analysis in strategizing interventions with the greatest likelihood of influencing the genomics industry in ethically desirable ways. This project addresses the NHGRI ELSI research priorities of genomic equity and social justice, as well as genomics and public health. Its career development plan focuses on training in normative analysis and Delphi methods, as well as content training in genomics and entrepreneurship. The training will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University, where the school’s preeminent bioethics center houses world experts in qualitative and quantitative empirical bioethics, alongside the University’s leading research and training in the biomedical sciences and their application in industry. The integrated research and training plan will prepare the candidate as an independent ELSI scholar with a rigorous research program focused on empirical and normative analysis of the business of biomedicine and genomics, and engagement with industry stakeholders. This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) investigates and leverages perspectives from members of the health-related private sector genomics industry, to develop guidance for improving approaches to social and ethical issues in the industry. It does so through in-depth qualitative analysis (interviews, cases studies, comparative analysis), scholarly normative analysis (drawing on theories from bioethics and business ethics), and a Delphi process of iterative questionnaires with industry stakeholders, aimed at strategizing concrete change regarding social obligations of the industry. The research and training program is designed to contribute to a more just distribution of the benefits of genomic technologies.",Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues,10307826,R00HG010499,"['Attention ', ' Award ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Boston ', ' California ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Decision Making ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' India ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Social Obligations ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Private Sector ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Social Justice ', ' Social Responsibility ', ' South Africa ', ' Technology ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Privacy ', ' Entrepreneurship ', ' Entrepreneurial Skill ', ' Businesses ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Delphi Study ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Private Enterprises ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Employee ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' social ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' drug development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioethicist ', ' Bioethics Consultants ', ' business ethics ', ' Corporate Ethics ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' comparative ', ' population health ', ' operation ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' nebula ', ' nebulae ', ' nebular ', ' curative treatments ', ' curative intervention ', ' curative therapeutic ', ' curative therapy ', ' South African ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' ']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2021,249000,NY-13
"Clinical and Translational Science Award Contact PD/PI: SHAKER, REZA NONE Overall: Summary Lead: Reza Shaker MD 5 year direct: NIH/NCATS: $16,140,360 Institution: $34,670,756 Total: $50,811,116 In CTSA 3.0, we will continue our relentless pursuit to transform clinical and translational research in southeastern Wisconsin and the science of clinical and translational (CT) research. We remain focused on and committed to expansion of an engaged, knowledgeable, and high performing CT workforce, refinement of proficient and innovative infrastructure to support CT research and science and removing all impediments to the performance of research. Our long-standing mission to foster a borderless, collaborative, and synergistic research and research training environment for our multi-institutional translational workforce, our community stakeholders and health system members to advance the clinical/translational science research and improve the health of our community, our nation, and beyond continues to drive our direction. We remain committed to working within the CTSA consortium to learn from our colleagues across the nation and to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the CT field. The tri-lateral mutually learning ecosystem formed by our workforce, the community, and the health system shapes the framework for strategically moving forward and has led to the concept developed in this application of integrated clinical and research ensembles (ICREs) in which patients, clinical investigators, translational researchers, health system representatives, community members, population ambassadors, basic scientists, clinicians and others are brought together. We will further expand our outreach into the communities we serve, reaching deeper into underserved communities, and will incorporate CT research across the life span to pediatric, geriatric and underrepresented populations. In the end, our goal is to use our hard-earned experience and extended capabilities to address the unmet health needs of our patients and our community while persevering to advance our infrastructure and workforce development programs to meet the standards of the developing field of translational science and research. Page 166 Project Summary/Abstract Contact PD/PI: SHAKER, REZA NONE  Project Narrative Our community is in need of better preventive measures, more accurate diagnostics and more effective and efficient therapies. We offer a novel and comprehensive mechanism to address this need through research and education. We propose to create a mutually learning ecosystem that coalesce a myriad of requisite stakeholders including health systems, research enterprises and the community in southeast Wisconsin to work in tandem towards solutions that improve the health outcomes of our citizens.

"Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings Project Summary: Darwin Babino, PhD, a trained pharmacologist/electrophysiologist, has spent the last ten years working on several disciplines in the vision sciences. His proposal entitled “Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings” presents his overarching goal to improve vision restoration approaches by developing methods to test the potential of these techniques thereby accelerating the development of effective interventions. Dr. Babino and his primary mentor, Dr. Russell Van Gelder, have assembled a strong team of co-mentors at the University of Washington SOM and collaborators to guide him through the proposed training and research. His previous training will be supplemented with goals to help his development as an independent investigator: 1) Study design and practical learning in performing panretinal (MEA) biological experiments; 2) Fundamental and advanced techniques of the proposed optogenetic and stem-cell restoration techniques; 3) Application of advanced machine learning techniques; 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to establish an independent group. The ability to assess the function of panretinal circuitry will foster our understanding of the advantages and weaknesses of different restoration techniques (Aim 1). The work proposed here will improve an existing retinal acuity assessment tool which combines machine learning techniques on novel, high-density multielectrode array recordings of ganglion cell responses in several mouse models. The utility of this system will be demonstrated in assessing visual potential of the mouse retina in three different approaches to vision restoration that are challenging for in vivo assessment (Aim 2). In collaboration with Dr. Deepak A. Lamba at UCSF, we will apply our system to animals which have undergone stem-cell replacement of retinal cells including photoreceptor cells. An optogenetics approach will also be evaluated in collaboration with Dr. John Flannery at UC Berkeley whose group has developed vectors for expressing rhodopsin and cone opsins in ganglion and bipolar cells. Finally, differences between native and restored vison with small molecule photoswitches, light-activated inhibitors of voltage-gated potassium channels, which confer light-dependent firing on treated cells, will be assessed. The resulting advanced electrophysiology application will help elucidate fundamental questions about the functional retina, mechanisms that lead to retinal degeneration and the potential of several therapeutics for the treatment of retinal diseases. Furthermore, this career development award will facilitate Dr. Babino’s development into an independent investigator by priming an R01 grant application. Project Narrative: Project Narrative: The prevalence of vision loss from retinal degeneration numbers in the millions world-wide and is expected to double by the year 2050, and despite the development of several promising approaches to restore vision in the blind, progress in developing these therapies has been hampered by challenges in analysis of these methods in animal models. We describe a novel system that analyzes, by machine learning, retinal ganglion cell output in native, degenerated and therapeutically treated blind retinas which can characterize the visual information content of the ‘reanimated’ blind retina and thereby facilitate the development of these technologies. The system developed through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to the assessment of potential retinal acuity restoration by current and novel therapeutic approaches.",Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings,10244896,K99EY031333,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', '

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases.

"Equipment to facilitate expansion of MMRRC services related to gut microbiota and infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and future infectious agents PROJECT SUMMARY An overarching goal of the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri (MU- MMRRC) is to optimize and refine mouse models so that biomedical research using these models can proceed rapidly and effectively. The MU-MMRRC also conducts resource-related research, often collaboratively, to further refine and develop mutant mice and capitalize on the power of mouse genetics and associated microbiota for biomedical research. This proposal enhances the capacity of the MU MMRRC to further characterize and refine mouse models through characterization of biological material and enhance our capability to examine the role of infectious disease and the gut microbiome. In the immediate future this equipment will enhance our ongoing and proposed studies of COVID-19. As part of previous supplemental funding, the MU-MMRRC has succeeded in advancing this mouse strain as a model for human COVID-19, characterizing viral growth and the development of acute disease following intranasal and aerosol infection of mice with variations in gut microbiota and prior infection, recapitulating the disease in humans. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge from human samples the K18-hACE2 mouse will play a key role in evaluating pathogenesis and escape of immunity. As of May of 2021, there have been nearly 32 million survivors of COVID-19 in the United States. As an acute local and systemic inflammatory response is known to cause long-term post-infectious diseases such as chronic pulmonary and neurological diseases, the equipment requested for supplement funding will permit the MU-MMRRC an ability to further characterize and refine the mouse model for the benefit of short- and long-term biomedical research. In addition, this equipment will help the MU-MMRRC expand its ability to phenotype other mouse models in line with its long-term research goals of characterizing and optimizing mouse models by examining the effects of differing microbiota. Current equipment available for use in the BSL3 and ABSL3 laboratories is limited across the nation, effectively slowing COVID-19 research during this pandemic. Expanding the capacity of the BSL3 equipment resources available to analyze infected samples will allow the MU-MMRRC to continue to play a critical role in the biomedical research community and promote studies of pathogenesis for COVID-19. The objective of this proposal is therefore to provide several key pieces of equipment that are expected to be of use not only to COVID-19 researchers, but also provide flexibility to other researchers in the region and nation for studying disease pathogenesis in mouse BSL3 models. The resulting expansion of capabilities will be critical to research on these devastating diseases and on mouse models in general. Crucially, this equipment has use far beyond the pandemic and has been specifically chosen to enhance the parent grant’s research goals during this funding cycle and into future funding cycles. . PROJECT NARRATIVE The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri (MU-MMRRC) develops tools to optimize and facilitate research using mouse models of disease. These include ongoing research and collaborative studies designed to optimize the understanding of a mouse model of COVID-19 through natural history studies, microbiota manipulation, and development of aerosol inoculation strategies. In this proposal the capabilities of the MMRRC for research within the state-of-the-art biocontainment facilities available at MU will be enhanced through the acquisition of equipment for sensitive, high throughput quantification of infection and disease state. The proposed equipment infrastructure will enhance the impact of the MMRRC and mouse modeling to accelerate our understanding of acute and post-infectious diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and to expand the current value-added services of the MU-MMRRC.",Equipment to facilitate expansion of MMRRC services related to gut microbiota and infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and future

"MADIVA  (Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application) Project summary – MADIVA: Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application Research Hub Our research hub will develop data science to address the complex interplay, individual and public health challenges, and rising prevalence of multimorbidity in Africans. Epidemiological transition in Africa has greatly changed health risks at both individual and public health levels. Trauma, infectious & non- communicable diseases are major health challenges; multiple occurrences multiply burdens for individuals and communities. The inherent value from the increasingly rich and varied existing data has not been exploited. We have rich longitudinal epidemiological data sets, partial but increasingly available clinical and laboratory records, and genomic data. The data, as is common in the domain, is highly heterogeneous, and in parts, fragmented and incomplete. The Hub will be led by the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg collaborating with the African Population and Health Research Center (Nairobi, Kenya), IBM Research Africa, the South African Population Research Infrastructure Network and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The initial sites are an urban population in Nairobi, and a rural, transitioning, site in Bushbuckridge, South Africa: each has rich longitudinal data of >100,000 individuals. Although incomplete, clinical records are increasingly being captured digitally. Notably there is genomic data from a subset of individuals at each of the sites. Multimorbidity is inherently multi-factorial — fragmented unlinked data retards solutions. Project 1 focuses on linking. Integrated data sets will aid in understanding these communities, representative of many in Africa, and protocols developed will be applicable elsewhere. A researcher dashboard will allow researchers to find data and plan projects. A clinic dashboard will help clinic managers and health officials to monitor and plan effectively. Project 2 will be solution-oriented to develop novel data science methods to provide actionable insights. We will develop robust methods for risk profiling of individuals and communities using heterogeneous data. We pioneer the use of polygenic risk scores in Africa. Key data science questions are explicability of results and managing high-dimensional data without loss of power. An innovative aspect of our grant will be translational work with public precision health to provide insights into drug dispensing, pharmacogenomics, and behavioral or possible social interventions. The Capacity Development & Pilot Project Core will support a tiered set of pilot projects for African researchers at different career stages, leveraging our strong research platforms and networks. We aim to build capacity in key areas including incubation and cost modelling for data science. The Administrative and Leadership Core will provide the necessary leadership and project management and linking to other DS-I components. The Data Management and Analysis Core will develop protocols for the responsible sharing of data, data quality control, technical support as well as innovate new analysis techniques. The MADIVA Research Hub will develop data science techniques and solutions to tackle the problem of multimorbidity in Africa – the problem of multiple co-occurring diseases significantly adding to the health burden in Africa. Our primary research sites in rural Bushbuckridge, South Africa and urban Nairobi, Kenya each have rich data sets from longitudinal studies collected by the health and demographic surveillance systems based there, together with a nascent set of clinical health records and genomic data. We will develop and apply data science techniques to link the different data sets, build dashboards for different stakeholders and apply new machine learning techniques to automatically stratify populations for risk profiles to different diseases, including the use of polygenic risk scores.","MADIVA  (Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application)",10314291,U54TW012077,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Africa ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' South Africa ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' data quality ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' data sharing ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' clinical risk ', ' public health intervention ', ' data visualization ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Data Science ', ' South African ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' dashboard ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' population stratification ', ' Precision Health ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' risk prediction model ', ' social interventions ', ' Visualization ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' data infrastructure ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' metadata standards ', ' Data Store ', ' ']",FIC,"WITS HEALTH CONSORTIUM (PTY), LTD",U54,2021,1299340,
"Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy This K24 grant will provide the PI, Dr. Lin Yee Chen, a midcareer NIH-funded patient-oriented research (POR) investigator, with the protected time and support needed to (1) accelerate his current trajectory in mentoring junior clinicians and investigators who are conducting POR in cardiovascular (CV) science, (2) acquire additional training in mentoring methods, machine learning, and omics science, (3) promote his current research that aims to define the mechanisms underlying the relationship of the abnormal atrial substrate—atrial cardiomyopathy—and atrial fibrillation (AF) to ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes. Trainees in his AF Clinical Research Group will be recruited from the NIH-funded T32 training programs in the University of Minnesota's Division of Cardiology, Division of Epidemiology, and Division of Biostatistics; Department of Medicine Physician Scientist Training Program; KL2 and TL1 Programs of the CTSI; and graduate programs (MS in Clinical Research, MPH, and PhD) in the School of Public Health. For his career development, Dr. Chen will hone his mentoring skills and learn new skills in cutting-edge areas (machine learning and omics science) through focused study, selected coursework, seminars, and guidance from senior collaborators with domain expertise. Finally, this grant will support a research project that is based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which extends Dr. Chen’s ongoing work to elucidate the role of atrial cardiomyopathy in driving AF-related outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) Identify atrial cardiomyopathy subtypes by using machine learning approaches to analyze the extensive data at ARIC Visit 5 (2011-13): clinical, 2D-echocardiographic, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, ECG, and multi-omics data, (2) Evaluate association of subtypes with ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes, and (3) Discover specific risk factors for subtypes by analyzing risk factor measures collected at Visits 1-4 (1987-98). Crucially, findings will be validated in 2 independent community-based cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This project has significant impact: (1) This K24 grant will provide the PI with the protected time to enhance his current mentoring of trainees involved in POR. By assembling a team of senior collaborators that comprise experts in mentoring, data science, and molecular epidemiology, the PI provides an outstanding platform for his mentees to acquire cutting-edge skills in POR, (2) By resolving heterogeneity in atrial cardiomyopathy, the team will advance the NIH’s Precision Medicine initiative by personalizing current treatment for patients based on biological underpinnings, (3) The findings will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in classification of stroke risk in patients with AF, which will improve patient outcomes, (4) By efficiently leveraging existing resources of deeply phenotyped NHLBI cohorts, this project will fill critical knowledge gaps in prevention and treatment, thus achieving a sustained and powerful impact on CV public health, clinical practice, and education of the next generation of researchers in POR. The abnormal atrial substrate (atrial cardiomyopathy) is associated with elevated risks of ischemic stroke dementia, and other cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure. Progress in preventing these adverse outcomes has been hampered by unresolved heterogeneity underlying atrial cardiomyopathy; hence, this K24 grant will support a project that will use machine learning and dense phenotypic data to identify clinically relevant subtypes of atrial cardiomyopathy. Additionally, this K24 grant will foster a supportive environment for the mentoring of junior investigators involved in patient-oriented research and facilitate acquisition of new cutting-edge skills by the PI and his mentees.",Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy,10307378,K24HL155813,"['Aging ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Morbidity -

"Genomic medicine and gene function implementation for an underserved population PROJECT SUMMARY Here we propose to advance the goal of NHGRI to implement genomic medicine and focus on individuals who have not been able to afford DNA testing. The research takes place in the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas Childrens Hospital (TCH). Our team of clinicians, geneticists, computer scientists, genomicists and model organism researchers has had a five-year term of success with the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) Model Organisms Screening Center (MOSC). This has included successfully identifying a number of new disease genes such as EBF3, IRF2BPL, NACC1, TBX2, TOMM70, CDK19, ACOX1, WDR37, and ATP5F1D. We propose to recruit 100 individuals from an underserved population in Houston, Texas with suspected rare disease and without the means to pay for DNA sequencing through insurance. We will provide whole-exome sequencing which will generate a CAP/CLIA report that we anticipate could diagnose 35-40 individuals per year. The remaining individuals will then be converted to a family-based trio exome design. All the sequencing costs of this project will be covered by philanthrophic donation to our hospital and are not budgeted to the grant. We will make every effort to diagnose the remaining 60 individuals per year through machine learning and informatics using the MARRVEL platform, Drosophila functional studies of candidate genes and through ongoing 6 month, 12 month and 2 year follow-up with the patients where we will use matchmaking efforts such as GeneMatcher and Matchmaker exchange as well as our own genomic databases from the UDN and other studies to come to a genetic diagnosis. All subjects will receive genetic counseling from a trained team and will provide us with valuable medical, psychological and social data to guide how genomic implementation in an underserved population is perceived, impacts care and impacts the family. This work will not only produce novel insights into rare disease, diagnosis for undiagnosed families and an expanded role for genomics, it will guide us in the future to provide genomics and functional research to serve all individuals regardless of their ability to pay. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research study uses DNA sequencing to find a diagnose for families with children with a rare disease who may not be able to afford DNA sequencing studies. We use clinical testing, followed by more extensive computer technology and genetic research using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study genetic variation in patients with rare and undiagnosed disease.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,10130573,R01GM136659,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Collagen ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Cues ', ' Dermis ', ' Corium ', ' Cutis ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Histology ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' In Vitro ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Microscopy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Time ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' Transposase ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ', ' Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Fractionation ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sortings ', ' Measures ', ' Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV ', ' Adenosine Deaminase-Binding Proteins ', ' CD26 ', ' CD26 Antigens ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Papillary ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Dermal ', ' Hair follicle structure ', ' Hair Follicle ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Subcutaneous Tissue ', ' Hypodermis ', ' Subcutis ', ' Superficial Fascia ', ' Tela Subcutanea ', ' subdermal tissue ', ' Engraftment ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' BPD verteporfin ', ' BPD-MA ', ' Benzoporphyrin Derivative Monoacid Ring A ', ' Visudyne ', ' benzoporphyrin D ', ' verteporphin ', ' Verteporfin ', ' postnatal ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' fetal ', ' Hydrogels ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Protein Inhibition ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' reconstruction ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' functional loss ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' regenerative ', ' skin regeneration ', ' regenerate skin ', ' skin healing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' mechanical force ', ' skin wound ', ' cutaneous wound ', ' dermal wound ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' wound environment ', ' wound bed ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317427,CA-18
"Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa Project Summary/Abstract Background: A major challenge in evolutionary genomics is to characterize the forces shaping present-day patterns of genetic variation. For instance, the extent and manner in which natural selection affects genetic diversity remains highly controversial. Researchers have largely addressed this problem by developing statistical tests or summaries of genome sequence variation that provide insights into the evolutionary forces at play. However, because such approaches typically rely on a single univariate summary of the data, valuable discriminatory information present in the original dataset is lost. A more fruitful strategy would thus be to use multidimensional summaries of genomic data (e.g. a large vector of summary statistics) or even the totality of the input data (e.g. a matrix-representation of a sequence alignment) to make more accurate inferences. An even more powerful approach is to utilize data sets in which the same population is sampled at multiple time points, allowing one to observe evolutionary dynamics in action. Although such genomic time-series data are becoming more prevalent, the development of appropriate computational methodologies has lagged behind the proliferation of such data. Proposal: The Schrider Lab seeks to develop and apply powerful machine learning methods for evolutionary inference. Our work over the next five years will yield powerful software tools leveraging novel representations of genomic datasets, including time-series data. These efforts will dramatically improve researchers' ability to make accurate evolutionary inferences from both population genomic and phylogenetic data. Indeed, preliminary results demonstrate that our methods vastly outperform current approaches in evolutionary genetics. More importantly, we will use these tools to answer pressing evolutionary questions. In particular, our use of time-series data will reveal loci responsible for recent adaptation with much greater confidence than currently possible. Our efforts will help to resolve the controversy over the role of adaptation in shaping patterns of diversity across the human genome. This research has important implications for public health as well, as genes underlying recent adaptations are enriched for disease-associations. Moreover, we are constructing a time-series dataset in the mosquito vector species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We will interrogate these data for evidence of recent and ongoing adaptation—this work will reveal loci responsible for the evolution of resistance to insecticides and other control efforts. Encouraging preliminary data also suggest that our work in phylogenetics will substantially improve inferential power in this important research area. More broadly, the success of the novel approaches described in this proposal has the potential to transform the methodological landscape of evolutionary genomic data analysis. Project Narrative The work proposed here seeks to develop and apply powerful machine-learning based software tools for evolutionary genetic inference in humans, mosquito vectors, and other species. Such efforts have important health implications, as they can identify genes involved in adaptation, which in humans are often associated with disease and in mosquitos are often associated with resistance to insecticides and other control efforts.",Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa,10207692,R35GM138286,"['Aedes ', ' Affect ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecticides ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' vector mosquito ', ' vector ', ' time use ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2021,382894,NC-04
"Mouse Models of Human Cancer Database PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The laboratory mouse is the preeminent animal model system for investigation into the biology and genetics of human cancer. Mouse models have provided key insights into cancer susceptibility, the molecular genetics of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and therapy response in pre-clinical and co-clinical studies. Human tumors engrafted into immune compromised and humanized mice (aka, Patient Derived Xenografts) are playing an increasingly important role as a powerful preclinical platform for testing new cancer treatments. The Mouse Models of Human Cancer (MMHC) database is a unique on-line compendium of mouse models for human cancer. MMHCdb provides electronic access to expertly curated and harmonized information on diverse mouse models for human cancer along with tools for accessing and visualizing associated data from these models. This in turn, facilitates the selection of appropriate strains of mice for cancer genetics research. MMHCdb integrates data derived from peer-reviewed literature and from direct submissions from researchers. Data in MMHCdb are also obtained from other bioinformatics resources including PathBase, HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature database, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress.

"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Address Biomedical Challenges for Integrating Multi-view Data Project Summary Many diseases are complex, heterogeneous, conditions that affect multiple organs in the body and depend on the interplay between several factors that include genetic, cellular, molecular, and environmental factors. It is therefore not surprising that the pathogenesis of many complex diseases remain elusive, and therapeutic targets are lacking. The traditional approach that focus on a small number of molecules (e.g., genes or metabolites) or a single type of data (e.g., clinical or genetic) cannot address this complexity and heterogeneity. Integrative or systems biology approaches and network analysis can be used to leverage the strengths of data from multiple sources (e.g., genomics, metabolomics, epidemiology, clinical data) to achieve new insights into the pathobiology of complex diseases. Recent technological advances have enabled the production of vast amounts of diverse but related data with rich information that offer remarkable opportunities to understand biological processes involved in complex diseases and to transform medicine, yet at the same time present signiﬁcant analytical challenges including how to effectively synthesize information from the tens of thousands of data points to identify important biomarkers with potential to serve as therapeutic targets. To alleviate this, we will develop and apply a suite of novel, robust, and powerful statistical and machine learning methods for the integration and interpretation of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources. These models will also be used to deﬁne subpopulations of patients who have different prognoses or require different therapeutic approaches based on data from different sources. Further, we will make use of recent advances in network theory to model the complex multilateral relationships in molecular data from multiple sources. The proposed methods will be applied to several publicly available datasets and cohorts to ensure that we can generalize our work to other datasets and cohorts and thus increase the long-term impact of our research. The proposed research will also contribute valuable statistical and machine learning algorithms that will be broadly applicable to data from multiple sources and multiple cohorts and will be made available to the public free of charge. Project Narrative This proposed research is expected to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and personalized care through the integration and interpretation of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources; it will contribute valuable tools and methods with potential for identiﬁcation of novel molecular targets for therapeutic interventions and for discovery of novel disease subtypes for improved patient prognosis.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Address Biomedical Challenges for Integrating Multi-view Data,10274846,R35GM142695,"['Affect ', ' Charge ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Genomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Molecular ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multiple data sources ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R35,2021,351514,MN-05

"Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development Abstract Human craniofacial development is a complex process and frequently goes awry to cause a major class of birth defects, orofacial clefting, which affects approximately 1 in 700 live births. Proper facial development in mouse and human requires three sets of paired facial prominences coming together by growth, morphogenesis, and fusion. Embryonic facial development is strikingly similar in human and mouse, making the mouse the best available model system for human. Previous studies have shown that the expression of many thousands of genes changes across tissue layer, age, and/or prominence, as well as cell population during early mouse facial development. However, we still only have a rudimentary understanding of how these changes are regulated by the interaction of transcriptional modulators in the developing face. To understand how genes are transcriptionally regulated during facial development, this research seeks to construct transcriptional regulatory networks in a temporospatial manner by in silico analysis of publicly available multi- omic datasets. Aim 1 will focus on the identification and verification of transcriptional regulatory networks operating in facial mesenchyme with a focus on super-enhancers. Aim 2 will adopt a similar approach to study the ectoderm which acts as a vital signaling center for the mesenchyme. Finally, in Aim 3 I will apply knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to build transcriptional regulatory networks at the single cell level. These aims will take advantage of available RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, histone marker ChIP-seq, transcription factor ChIP-seq, bulk and single cell RNA-seq data from wild-type or mutant mice, as well as facial enhancer expression databases. Accomplishment of these studies will predict how genes are transcriptionally regulated in a temporospatial manner during facial development and discover sets of core transcription factors and super- enhancers controlling facial development. These transcriptional regulatory networks will be relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of human orofacial clefting, and will provide clear testable predictions about transcription factor function and the consequences of aberrant expression. Performance and accomplishment of these Aims will also act as a major component of my career development plan, in which my goal is to obtain and independent tenure-track faculty position and serve as a mentor to the next generation of scientists. A major aspect of my career development plan is to build on my growing strength in bioinformatics by learning more advanced techniques in this specialty alongside new computational based approaches, such as machine learning. In this respect, my Aims and career development plan are aligned with a Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) of NIDCR in Supporting Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Using Bioinformatic, Computational, and Data Science Approaches (NOT-DE-20-006) for which this application is targeted. I have recruited a mentorship team with specialties in craniofacial biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and career development to help me achieve these goals. Project Narrative Human craniofacial development is a complex process and requires suites of genes to be switched on and off at appropriate times and spaces during formation of the embryo. There is now a wealth of data available in public databases concerning which genes are expressed when and where during mammalian facial development, including for the transcription factors which are the proteins that regulate these critical expression programs, but we have not yet begun to connect this information together to derive logical predictions about the critical networks responsible for craniofacial development. This proposal will address that gap using both computational and laboratory-based methods to derive and verify transcriptional regulatory networks relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of normal facial development as well as how these are disrupted to cause defects such as human orofacial clefting.",Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development,10284443,K01DE030923,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Ectoderm ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Study models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Pathology ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mesenchyme ', ' Mesenchymas ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Solid ', ' Dental ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Oral ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' interest ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' Performance ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Validation ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Computational Science ', ' Population ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' critical period ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' FaceBase ', ' craniofacial development ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' Data Science ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' recruit ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2021,130135,CO-06
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Spatial omics technologies to map the senescent cell microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Cellular senescence is a biological program whereby cells exit the cell cycle, typically as a consequence of DNA damage accumulation. After exerting their beneficial effects in young individuals by playing a role in tissue homeostasis, wound healing and tumor suppression, senescent cells are recognized and cleared by the immune system in response to their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). With age, immunosurveillance becomes increasingly dysregulated, senescent cells accumulate in tissues and their SASP leads to chronic inflammation which has been linked to many age-associated diseases including neurodegeneration, diabetes, osteoarthritis, fibrosis, heart disease and cancer. In addition, radiation and chemotherapy cause the accumulation of senescent cells in both normal and cancer tissues and create a microenvironment which can promote tumor relapse. Hence, methods to characterize the diversity of senescent cells in tissues are critical to improve our understanding of their roles in both normal physiology and disease and to develop more precise and effective senolytic and senostatic interventions. We propose to develop new technologies and integrative solutions to map the spatial epigenomic, transcriptome and proteomic states of senescent cells and their microenvironment in complex tissues. In the UG3 phase, we will develop spatial genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics methodologies to delineate senescent cells in a diverse set of murine tissues, including brain, liver and adipose tissue. We will also perform feasibility studies in a limited number of human samples available through tissue banks and collaborators, and in human cell culture. Our goal is to provide a proof of principle and evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of our proposed tools, technologies and methods (TTM) to identify and characterize the heterogeneity of senescent cells in multiple tissues. In the HG3 phase, we will optimize and expand our methodology to a variety of human tissues obtained from normal samples available from tissue banks, and via collaborations with other SenNet Tissue Mapping Centers (TMCs). Project Narrative Identification of senescent cells in tissues is particularly challenging as it requires detection of sets of markers that can be cell type specific. Our goal is to develop single cell multi-omic imaging technology to measure proteins, RNA and the DNA’s 3-dimensional conformation in senescent cells and in their microenvironment, in a diverse set of tissues. This new technology will allow us to better understand the heterogeneity of the senescent phenotype in tissues, and to study how senescent cells affect the status of neighboring cells.",Spatial omics technologies to map the senescent cell microenvironment,10384585,UG3CA268202,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunologic Surveillance ', ' Immune Surveillance ', ' Immunologic Surveillances ', ' Immunological Surveillance ', ' Immunological Surveillances ', ' Immunosurveillance ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intrinsic factor ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Relapse ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue repository ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Nuclear ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Transcript ', ' Tumor Suppression ', ' Molecular Tumor Suppression ', ' Molecular ', ' epigenomics ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Imaging technology ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Chemotherapy and/or radiation ', ' Chemotherapy and Radiation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,UG3,2021,357900,RI-01

"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,10256016,RM1HG009034,"['Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Collection ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' European Union ', ' European Community ', ' Family ', ' Genetic Identity ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Imagination ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Newspapers ', ' Perception ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Protection ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Film ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' news ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Privacy ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Legal ', ' Radio ', ' ACT2 ', ' AT744.1 ', ' Act-2 ', ' CCL4 ', ' Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 4 ', ' Immune Activation 2 ', ' MIP1B ', ' MIP1B1 ', ' Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1-Beta ', ' SCYA4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A4 ', ' CCL4 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Use of New Techniques ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ELSI ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' community setting ', ' minimal risk ', ' legal implication ', ' data sharing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' genetic information ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Genetic study ', ' social media ', ' data access ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' All of Us Research Program ', ' All of Us Program ', ' All of Us Research Project ', ' AoURP ', ' Infrastructure ', ' blockchain ', ' block chain ', ' data privacy ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' ']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2021,1051733,TN-05
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,10259872,P50AR070590,"['Psoriatic Arthritis ', ' Arthritic Psoriasis ', '
