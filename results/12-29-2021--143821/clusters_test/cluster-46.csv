"Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Children ABSTRACT About 55% of children with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment and up to 80% of children with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. Treatments are often not initiated until issues are significantly impacting the child and family. This study aims to conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in, and coordination of needed mental health services for children. The first task of the study will focus on the implementation of a predictive model to identify symptomatic children with no diagnosed mental health disorder(s) or treatments initiated. The tool identifies patients with documentation of mental health symptoms or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Using this predictive algorithm, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200 patients per arm (n=400). Children with (1) a new mental health diagnosis but no treatment initiated; (2) a new mental health medication ordered with no mental health diagnosis; and (3) symptoms identified by the predictive model with no new mental health diagnosis or treatment initiated will be recruited. The study intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services, conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 psychotherapy sessions (when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental health providers in the community, and reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are missed. The primary outcome is the percentage of youth initiating psychotherapy. The secondary outcome is the percentage of youth with at least 4 mental health visits. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have higher rates of psychotherapy use compared to the control arm. We will also assess initiation of psychotropic medications. All primary analyses will follow an intent-to-treat approach. A waiver of consent will be obtained to include data for all individuals offered the intervention in the analysis, regardless of the amount of intervention (“dose” of navigation) received. NARRATIVE Mental illnesses often first appear in childhood and yet go mostly untreated until a serious disorder develops. This study will (a) implement ways to identify early mental health needs in children 4-12 years of age using free text notes entered into medical records, and (b) carry out a two-arm randomized trial to test if offering navigator support and video-based psychotherapy result in more mental health visits over a 6-month period of time.",Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health

"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this study is to build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system that can inform effective recruitment and retention strategies to prevent excessive turnover. High turnover rates (estimated 25-60% annually) are devastating for mental health care systems, affecting organizations (e.g., cost), employees (e.g., work well-being), and most critically, the quality of care. Human resource departments collect extensive employee data that can be useful predictors for turnover, but these data are not often analyzed to address turnover issues in mental health organizations. Computational methods have greatly evolved and can now access and analyze large and complex data. This pilot study will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: build and test turnover prediction models by developing and applying machine learning algorithms to existing human resource data; Aim 2: generate critical questions to enhance turnover prediction through qualitative methods; and Aim 3: test the enhanced model in predicting turnover at 12 months. In Aim 1, using past human resource data and service encounters from [two mental health organizations (rural and urban locations)], we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict turnover. The algorithms will address turnover questions simultaneously (e.g., Who are the most likely to leave? What factors predict turnover at varying time points in employment?). In Aim 2, we will interview key informants: “leavers” (employees who voluntarily terminate employment during the study); “stayers” (employees with extreme longevity in the organization); and “predictees” (identified as likely to leave, based on our algorithms). The findings will be discussed in two focus groups in order to generate, refine, and validate 5-10 critical questions to enhance prediction of turnover. In Aim 3, we will conduct an on-line survey of all current employees to assess the 5-10 critical questions and link survey data with data from human resources and services to examine the improved precision between the theory-based model (predictors in the survey) and the data-driven model (machine learning algorithms) in predicting actual turnover 12 months later. Machine learning can model complex and dynamic variable relationships (e.g., handling a large number of variables, accounting for heterogeneity) and overcome limitations in traditional turnover research that often relies on small, cross-sectional, and convenience samples. Successful completion of this study will promote data-driven, evidence-based organizational management practices to address turnover, which is aligned with NIMH priorities of capitalizing on existing data structures and using technologies to improve mental health service quality. This study will be a critical step in developing highly adaptable machine learning algorithms to predict turnover; ultimately, we envision that this system will be partnered with future clinical interventions to reduce turnover in mental health. Project Narrative This pilot study will build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system to inform effective recruitment and retention strategies for preventing excessive employee turnover in mental health organizations. Successful retention of a quality workforce not only helps mental health organizations and their employees, but also directly impacts the quality of care that clients receive. In addition, a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system could be partnered with clinical interventions to reduce turnover.",Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals,10074594,R34MH119411,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Professional Burnout ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Community Mental Health Centers ', ' CMHC ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Employment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Job Satisfaction ', ' Work Satisfaction ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Personnel Turnover ', ' Employee Turnover ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' mental health organization ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' urban area ', ' urban location ', ' urban region ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' Services ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' Employee ', ' Practice Management ', ' Structure ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' informant ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' retention rate ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' complex data ', ' ']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R34,2021,230630,IN-07
"Automated Mental Health Referral System This proposal addresses a significant barrier to obtaining treatment for college-age  youth with mental disorders. Many college-age youth with impairing mental disorders  remain untreated because of concerns about stigma and privacy, inconvenience and wait times, and  because universities are often unable to service all such students. Also, of critical importance,  when referral for treatment is implemented, it is without regard to the person's pathology,  because of the erroneous assumption that treatment need not be tailored to the  individual. This proposal aims to address this critical clinical issue. We advance that a  sophisticated automated online referral system would resolve all of these problems, but there is no  expert-trained system for psychiatric referrals. We propose to automate the referral process,  designed for college-age youth, by bridging online, mental health assessments and curated,  up-to-date, mental health provider networks. To this end, the non-profit Child Mind  1nstitute is partnering with the for-profit MiResource. Assessment expertise is provided  by the Child Mind Institute, which treats children and adolescents with mental health  disorders, conducts mental health research, has acquired large assessment datasets, has in-house  expertise in mental health assessment, and through its MATTER lab has developed novel assessment  technologies such as the Mindlogger data collection and assessment platform. Referral  infrastructure is provided by MiResource, a software-as-a-service solution designed to help  universities connect students to local mental health providers. The MATTER lab and MiResource  will develop an automated online assessment and referral platform that uses expert-trained  machine learning to provide users with personalized referrals for mental health care.  Expert referrals will be based on the six dimensions of the level of Care Utilization System (risk  of harm, functional status, comorbidity, environment, treatment history, and attitude)  applied to college students' responses to mental health assessments. 1n Phase 1, we will (1-1)  build mental health assessments into the Mindlogger platform, (1-2) build an expert  referral collection interface, and (1-3) set up a machine learning pipeline for training and  testing an updatable classification model for automated clinically appropriate, personalized  referrals. 1n Phase 11, we will build, refine, and clinically validate our  product for commercialization. Specifically, we will (11-1) validate the Phase I framework on a  university population, (11-2) integrate Mindlogger's assessments into MiResource, and (11-3)  conduct usability and quality assurance tests of the new Mindlogger plus MiResource platform,   to get feedback about issues related to accessibility, relevance, accuracy, and esthetics,  and incorporate solutions in response to this feedback into a final version. College-age youth do not have easy access to expert referral coordinators to get  referrals to appropriate mental health care, due to the stigma of seeing a referral coordinator  in-person, long wait times to get an intake appointment in the university counseling center,  or limited or no referral counselors available in their higher-education institution. We  propose to automate the referral process, focusing on college-age youth, by bridging online  assessments and curated, up-to-date mental health provider networks.

"Digital Mental Health Service for Non-Treatment Seeking Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY  Young adults aged 18-24 experience higher levels of mental health problems than any other adult age group. Over one quarter of all young adults living in the United States suffer from a mental health condition. Unfortunately, they are the adult age group who are least likely to seek or receive traditional face-to-face treatments such as in-person psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. There is evidence that they are, however, interested in using digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), such as mobile and web-based apps, to support symptom self-management and skill building. While evidence suggests mental health apps can effectively reduce symptom severity, they require motivation from the user to open and use the app, which contributes to the high dropout rates. The primary method of addressing dropout has been the use of human coaching, which boosts engagement.  SMS text messages arrive through the most commonly used app on the phone, and are therefore likely to be viewed. Initial work in text message interventions suggests good adherence, as effort is low, but effectiveness has been inconsistent. Messages can be perceived as off-target or impersonal, and it is difficult to convey more complex information. This project aims to address these problems by developing and piloting a personalized text messaging platform that uses machine learning to tailor SMS messages to an individual’s needs and preferences, and URL links to provide access to psychoeducational content to contextualize messages, when the length of that content exceeds the limitations of messages. This project will include a partnership with Mental Health America, the nation’s largest mental health advocacy organization.  The primary goals of the project are to: (1) Develop an adaptive messaging service for young adults that personalizes messages and psychoeducational content to the needs and preferences of an individual, (2) Conduct a feasibility trial using a sequential multiple assignment randomized treatment (SMART) design, which will evalutate (a) the effectiveness of an adaptive, personalized messaging intervention in reducing engagement relative to a static version; and (b) whether human coaching results in greater symptom reduction and engagement, relative an unguided implementation.  This project will, in the near term, allow us to determine the feasibility of this intervention, including whether our adaptive intervention affects treatment psychological and engagement targets, and reduces psychological distress. It will also provide preliminary information on the feasibility of a scalable model of targeted, low- intensity coaching for users who may require additional support above and beyond a fully automated intervention. This will prepare us for our longer-term goal of conducting a fully-powered randomized controlled trial of our adaptive intervention in an online community setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and evaluate a highly personalized SMS text messaging intervention for depression and anxiety among young adults, who are not interested in receiving traditional psychological or psychiatric treatment for their psychological symptoms. We will use machine learning to provide young adults with the most useful SMS messages and the most relevant psychological strategy modules. In partnership with Mental Health America, the nation’s largest mental health advocacy organization, this project has the potential to establish a highly scalable digital mental health service.",Digital Mental Health Service for Non-Treatment Seeking Young Adults,10285466,R34MH124960,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attitude ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dropout ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Voice ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Chronic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' self reliance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' health literacy ', ' treatment trial ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' aged ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' iterative design ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' psychoeducational ', ' community setting ', ' secondary outcome ', ' screening ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' online community ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' symptom self management ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' psychological symptom ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' feasibility trial ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' text messaging intervention ', ' text based intervention ', ' text intervention ', ' digital mental health ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R34,2021,219658,IL-07

"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,10441036,R00MH118359,[''],NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R00,2021,249000,UT-02
"Combining data sources to identify effect moderation for personalized mental health treatment Project Summary Determining “what works for whom” is a key goal in prevention and treatment across a variety of areas, including mental health. By understanding which individuals benefit most from which treatments we have the possibility of directing scarce resources to those who will most benefit, and of reducing the “churn” of individuals attempting multiple treatments before finding the one that works for them. Identifying effect moderators—factors that relate to the size of treatment effects--is crucial for delivery of treatment and prevention interventions, but doing so is incredibly difficult using standard study designs. Randomized trials, the gold standard for estimating average effects, are typically under-powered to detect moderation. Large-scale non- experimental studies may provide another way to examine effect moderation, but can suffer from confounding. New methods are needed to best harness the data available to learn how to personalize mental health treatments. This work will synthesize, extend, and apply methods for identifying effect moderators when multiple studies are available, with a particular focus on the complexities in mental health research. The methods will apply broadly and will be illustrated in an example estimating the effects of medication treatment for schizophrenia, using data from 11 randomized controlled trials and non-experimental data from the Duke University Health System electronic health record. The work will: 1) Extend moderation methods for scenarios with multiple randomized experiments, 2) Develop methods for using data from combined datasets with both experimental and non-experimental designs to identify effect moderation, and 3) Disseminate the methods to mental health researchers. By developing methods to take full advantage of both experimental and non-experimental data this work has the potential to move towards personalized mental health, thus improving how we prevent and treat mental health challenges in the population.

"Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Mood disorders, like many psychiatric conditions, have their onset in emerging adulthood and often last a lifetime. Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years, making early intervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clear mania is absent. In fact, BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis, with 70% misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals is complex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications in patients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that, using resting fMRI, we can predict future medication class response with high accuracy (> 90%). In this project we will build on this work to generalize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop, in consultation with multiple psychiatrists, a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocol and machine learning analysis, in a timely, meaningful, and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be an important step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness. 2 Project Narrative  Patients with mood disorders will often spend months to years on the wrong medication, which can also make them worse (e.g., putting individuals with bipolar disorder on antidepressants). There is a great need to develop biomarkers of treatment response in mental illness. This work will build on recent work from our group showing over 90% accuracy using resting fMRI predictors to further generalize the results to multiple scanners and develop an online portal to

"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,10207414,R44MH116751,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Psychiatry ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Interview ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' Single major depression ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' major depressive episode ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty Boards ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', "" Ch'i "", ' Qi ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Co-ordination disorder ', ' Coordination Disorder ', ' Dyscoordination ', ' Incoordination ', ' Lack of Coordination ', ' Abnormal coordination ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup ', ' checkup examination ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Agreement ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Modality ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' behavioral health ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Teenagers ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' child depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 17 year old ', ' 17 years of age ', ' age 17 years ', ' seventeen year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' volunteer ', ' control trial ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' adolescent health ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' implementation strategy ', ' strategies for implementation ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' ']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,507941,MD-03
"Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Project Summary The untreated burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States is a massive contributor to healthcare budgets in both the military and civilian sectors, and better treatment and prevention methods are needed. Fortunately, awareness of PTSD among military service members has grown in recent years, and yet, there is a hidden epidemic of PTSD among civilians and women. Women experience PTSD at about twice the rate of men (11% vs. 5%), but the causes for this sex difference are largely unknown. It has long been suspected that sex hormones play a major role in development of – and also potentially protection from – PTSD and other mental health disorders. This project will provide the largest ever study of sex hormone effects on PTSD and the related mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety disorders. Whereas studies in the past were limited by small sample sizes and results were inconclusive, this investigation will use a massive sample size of approximately 500,000 participants to answer questions about two well-known sex hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and three psychiatric outcomes (PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders). These variables were measured in the UK Biobank, and we have been granted access to the data to study sex hormone effects on mental health outcomes and to study genetic effects underlying both sex hormone levels and mental health disorders. The completion of this work will reveal whether rates of mental health disorders vary with testosterone and estradiol levels. It may be the case that levels of hormones that are both too high and too low are problematic. Given this reality, we will use sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques, and therefore we will be able to detect linear and non-linear relationships between sex hormones and PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The sample size and study design make this the most powerful study conducted to date, and the results will be generalizable to diverse populations. In addition to the outcomes mentioned above, we will further explore genetic effects underlying relationships between sex hormones and mental health disorders. To do this, we will conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of both testosterone and estradiol. We will then make polygenic scores for testosterone and estradiol, yielding genetic proxies of sex hormone levels which can be used in studies in which sex hormones have not been measured. Finally, we will test for shared genetic effects between genetic effects on sex hormones and genetic effects on psychiatric disorders in order to better understand the etiology of these common, debilitating, and inadequately treated mental health disorders. Taken together, these findings will provide critical foundational knowledge relevant to clinical trials which are currently testing testosterone and estradiol as treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These results will also provide actionable findings for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. Project Narrative Sex hormone altering medications are prescribed to over 40% of American adults, and yet the mental health consequences of sex hormones are still poorly understood. This project will be the largest ever investigation of sex hormone effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety disorders, and the results of this powerful study design will provide much-needed information relevant to the development of new treatment and prevention strategies. The precision medicine approach used here relies on biomarkers and results will be tailored to individuals. 1",Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),10398466,R01MH123486,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Budgets ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Epidemic ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' military population ', ' Play ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' sex steroid ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Testing ', ' Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' Outcome ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' service member ', ' military member ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' military service ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,78738,CA-18
"Adaptive Messaging to Support Depression Self-Management Summary Automated messaging has significant potential to extend access to guidance and support for those managing common mental health conditions like depression. However, benefits of automated messaging could be improved through building capacity to automatically adapt messaging approaches to users’ needs. The PI’s career goal is to establish scalable digital mental health interventions that deliver individualized communication to maximize users’ engagement in effectively managing mental health concerns. This proposal outlines training and research plans to achieve this goal, culminating in a successful R01 proposal. The training plan takes full advantage of the strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies, which is led by the primary mentor for this proposal. Training goals necessary to the PI’s career goal include growth in (1) user-centered design, (2) adaptive interventions, and (3) clinical science methodologies. This proposal builds on the PI’s background in communication science, which has focused on effective message design and social support provision. In this K01, the PI will aim to develop a model for delivering automated, individualized self-management support for depression, emphasizing messaging that can accommodate fluctuations in users’ motivations and abilities to carry out cognitive and behavioral self-management strategies. This will be achieved through the following specific aims: (1) conduct user-centered design activities and usability testing to design and refine a messaging system; (2) integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm into the system that adapts content to users and their contexts; and (3) pilot procedures and analyses for a randomized controlled trial and obtain preliminary evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness and mechanisms of action. For Aim 3, I will test hypotheses that messaging interventions will result in greater reduction in depression than a waitlist control group, and that adaptive messaging will reduce depression relative to non-adaptive messaging by producing greater engagement in self-management. This research is expected to advance the design of messaging interventions for depression, ultimately extending the reach and effectiveness of these interventions. Skills acquired by carrying out the research proposed in this application will allow the PI to successfully compete for R01 funding in order to conduct a larger effectiveness trial. Narrative Technology-based interventions hold promise to extend the availability of support for individuals managing mental health concerns, but their success requires keeping users engaged over time. This K01 proposal leverages machine learning to establish a messaging intervention that can automatically adapt communication styles to accommodate users’ individualized support needs and preferences and their fluctuations over time. If successful, this project will lead to a scalable intervention model that delivers engaging, personalized support while imposing low burden on users and the health system, and that could be broadly applied to address a wide variety of mental health conditions.",Adaptive Messaging to Support Depression Self-Management,10301596,K01MH125172,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communication ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Program Development ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' treatment effect ', ' tailored messaging ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' learning algorithm ', ' intervention refinement ', ' digital health ', ' digital mental health ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2021,175377,IL-07
"Digital Phenotyping To Screen For Early Childhood Internalizing Disorders ABSTRACT Childhood anxiety and depression are common, impairing, and have the potential to disrupt development well into adulthood. Pediatricians need mental health screening tools to meet the prevalence of these internalizing disorders early in childhood. We have developed a promising digital health approach for detecting movement and speech phenotypes of internalizing disorders in young children. My long-term goal is to create a novel technology for screening young children for internalizing disorders at scale. My short term objective is to leverage my original approach and my proposed training curriculum to create a prototype mobile health (mHealth) application that provides a composite digital phenotype to detect childhood internalizing disorders. My specific aims are to (1) evaluate the validity of digital phenotypes measured by a novel mHealth system for identifying internalizing disorders in young children and (2) develop a composite digital phenotype for childhood internalizing disorders involving multiple constructs from the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) and identify moderating RDoC construct variables. If successful, these mHealth enabled digital phenotypes may be used to further NIMH health initiatives of enabling better tracking of changes in internalizing mental health status across childhood and supporting new and innovative research-practice partnerships with pediatrics to improve dissemination of evidence-based mental health screening. Similarly, this approach answers a need identified by the American Academic of Pediatrics for new tools that screen for behavioral and emotional problems. Seventy children between the ages of 4 and 8 years, oversampled for internalizing disorders, will be recruited for this study from pediatric and childhood mental health services at a university-based regional medical center that services the state of Vermont and upstate New York. They will be administered mood induction tasks design to press for RDoC Negative and Positive Valence constructs, while instrumented with a belt-worn smartphone enabled with the prototype mHealth application. A composite digital phenotype will be developed across constructs based on statistical classification models trained using machine learning on data captured during the tasks. To carry out this work as an independent investigator, I propose an intensive training curriculum to gain foundational skills in digital phenotyping. It includes training in (1) developmental epidemiology to better research early childhood psychopathology through a public health lens, and (2a) mobile app development to communicate effectively with app developers (2b) analysis of complex systems including machine learning approaches, (2c) ethical and societal issues regarding digital psychiatry. Completion of these training and research aims will provide me the skills and evidence to develop an easily administered digital health technology for identifying young children with internalizing disorders in the short-term, and in the long term, the ability to successfully contribute to the emerging field of digital health for the purpose of improving childhood mental health.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,10205954,R01MH116156,"['Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', '

"Leveraging interactive SMS messaging to monitor and support maternal mental health in Kenya ABSTRACT Perinatal depression, defined as a depressive episode during pregnancy or in the first year postpartum, is the most common complication of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of peripartum women globally. An enormous gap exists in supporting women experiencing perinatal depression. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions such as interactive SMS text messaging with healthcare workers (HCWs) have been proposed as resource-efficient, accessible adjuncts to in-person care. Realizing the full public health potential of mHealth for mental health will require strategic use of automation and empiric definition of interventions that dynamically adapt to user needs. This K18 mentored career enhancement award aims to support Dr. Keshet Ronen, an epidemiologist with multidisciplinary training, to become an expert in analysis of mHealth communication and development of adaptive mHealth interventions. Building on Dr. Ronen’s established expertise in development and evaluation of mHealth interventions using SMS and social media, and supported by a team of experienced mentors, the following research and training aims are proposed. Training plan: Through didactic coursework, individual mentor meetings, seminars, and conferences, Dr. Ronen seeks to accomplish the following Career Enhancement Goals. (1) Gain proficiency and experience using natural language processing and machine learning methods to analyze mHealth communication. (2) Gain proficiency and experience in design of an adaptive mHealth intervention. (3) Deepen understanding of mHealth intervention design for mental health. (4) Enhance skills in international study implementation and clinical trial design. The proposed training plan will augment Dr. Ronen’s prior training and experience and allow her to complete the proposed Research plan: Mobile WACh is a unique interactive SMS messaging platform that has been shown to improve maternal-child health and whose impact on perinatal depression is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in Kenya, Mobile WACh Neo. We propose to leverage a dataset of >100,000 SMS messages with >3000 peripartum women in previous and ongoing Mobile WACh studies to (1) develop a predictive model that can detect client SMS indicating elevated depression symptoms, and (2) identify HCW message characteristics associated with improvements in depression symptoms. (3) Models from Aims 1-2 will be implemented in the Mobile WACh software to develop an adaptive version of Mobile WACh Neo that flags concerning messages and guides HCWs on SMS composition. A pilot study of Adaptive Mobile WACh Neo will be conducted, nested within the Mobile WACh Neo randomized controlled trial in Kenya (R01HD098105), to evaluate its acceptability and preliminary impact on time taken for HCWs to respond to client messages. Collectively, these activities will enable Dr. Ronen to become a leader in the study of adaptive mHealth interventions to support maternal mental health in resource-limited settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy, but it is undertreated due to lack of mental healthcare resources and barriers to in-person care. Short message service (SMS) text messaging is a promising tool to support mental health in the high-risk peripartum period.

"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations.

"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,10063830,R01MH112829,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' video chat ', ' video conferencing ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' trend ', ' beneficiary ', ' medication compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' trial comparing ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' population health ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' improved outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Telemental ', ' Telemental health ', ' care costs ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' underserved community ', ' under served community ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,643165,MA-07

This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",10305163,K08MH120341,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Respondent ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' screening ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' trial design ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' Text Messaging ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' barrier to care ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' service delivery ', ' Facebook ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' multiphase optimization strategy ', ' digital health ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,54000,MO-01
"Telehealth 2.0: Evaluating effectiveness and engagement strategies for asynchronous texting based trauma focused therapy for PTSD The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges for trauma-exposed individuals due to increased isolation, insufficient capacity in the mental health workforce, and a predicted fourth wave of mental health impacts of the pandemic itself [1,2]. There is a pressing need to increase treatment capacity for individuals with trauma-related mental health problems directly related to or exacerbated by the pandemic [6]. Digital mental health (DMH) interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) address well-documented barriers to traditional in-person psychotherapy or telehealth delivery of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for PTSD, but many consumers do not remain engaged [7]. Thus, acceptable, efficient, and engaging forms of EBTs are sorely needed, particularly for those who are less likely to access traditional psychotherapy or use online programs. Asynchronous texting therapy platforms may facilitate treatment engagement among those who seek discrete, convenient, and affordable support [9]. In our pilot of a texting-based format of an EBT for PTSD, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT-Text), we found CPT-Text was feasible to deliver, and clients showed substantially greater PTSD symptom improvement over a shorter time compared to text therapy as usual (TAU) [5,6]. A larger scale, more rigorous test is necessary. Additional refinement also is needed to address challenges to sustained engagement that were identified both in the pilot and more broadly in other DMH interventions. We propose a randomized, Hybrid Type 1, implementation-effectiveness trial with a factorial design to compare text-based therapies for PTSD utilizing the HIPAA-compliant secure texting platform of our DMH partner, Talkspace. We will randomize participants (N= 400) who have PTSD that is related to or has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic into CPT-Text or text-based TAU. Participants will also be randomized into one of two engagement strategies: therapist reminder as usual (RAU) or RAU + incentive (RI). We will examine an innovative incentive structure in which participants who remain engaged in the intervention will have the option of retaining their introductory discount or donating it to individuals in need of financial support. We will compare the impact of engagement strategy on treatment response and engagement, and we will examine motivation as a potential mechanism. We also will evaluate a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to assessing CPT-Text fidelity. This study will be conducted by a team with expertise in PTSD treatment, DMH, biostatistics, marketing, and implementation. It aligns with PAR-20- 243 by focusing on text-based interventions for PTSD related to or exacerbated by the COVID pandemic. It also has a well-established DMH partner to increase reach of and access to EBTs in response to the growing needs created by the pandemic. This study will (1) provide critical information about how to promote sustained DMH engagement using unique incentive strategies and moderators of engagement and outcomes and (2) offer first guidance on supporting quality and fidelity of messaging-based EBTs using NLP. Project Narrative There is a pressing need to increase capacity to treat PTSD related to or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Texting-based therapy holds promise to increase capacity and reduce barriers to delivering evidence-based treatments (EBTs), but ongoing engagement in digital mental health interventions is low. This study will compare a texting-based EBT for PTSD to texting-based treatment as usual, and it will also compare a unique incentive strategy to typical platform reminders aimed to prevent early discontinuation in therapy.",Telehealth 2.0: Evaluating effectiveness and engagement strategies for asynchronous texting based trauma focused therapy for PTSD,10362027,RF1MH128785,"['Anxiety ', '

"Enhancing the quality of CBT in community mental health through AI-generated fidelity feedback Each year, millions of Americans receive evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of mental and behavioral health problems. Yet, at present, there is no scalable method for evaluating the quality of psychotherapy services. In research settings, human-based behavioral coding methods are used, but these are time consuming, costly, and rarely used in real-world clinical settings. Thus, EBP quality and effectiveness is unmeasured and unknown. The current, fast-track STTR proposal will develop and evaluate an AI-based software system (LyssnCBT) that will automatically estimate CBT fidelity from an audio recording of a CBT session. Importantly, the current work builds from Lyssn’s previous, successful work in developing an automated system for evaluating motivational interviewing (MI), and previous research showing that AI algorithms can accurately estimate CBT fidelity.  Lyssn.io, Inc., (“Lyssn”) is a start-up developing AI-based technologies to support training, supervision, and quality assurance of evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn offers a HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based platform for secure recording, sharing, and reviewing of therapy sessions, which includes AI-generated metrics for MI. The proposed LyssnCBT tool will build from and be integrated into this core platform. Lyssn is partnering with Dr. Torrey Creed and the Penn Collaborative, which has a 14+ year track record of gold-standard CBT training and supervision, including more than 100 community agencies with almost 900 providers. The expertise, relationships, and amassed data -- more than 8,000 recorded sessions and more than 3,000 rated for CBT fidelity -- form the clinical foundation for the current research.  Phase I will work from an existing AI-CBT prototype to develop LyssnCBT. Core activities include user-centered design focus groups and interviews with community mental health (CMH) therapists, supervisors, and administrators, which will inform the design and development of LyssnCBT. LyssnCBT will be evaluated for usability and implementation readiness in a final stage of Phase I. Phase II will conduct a field-based usability trial and a stepped-wedge, hybrid implementation-effectiveness randomized trial (N = 1,850 CMH clients) to evaluate the effectiveness of LyssnCBT to improve therapist CBT skills and client outcomes, and to reduce client drop-out. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanism of action underlying LyssnCBT.  The research is strongly aligned with NIMH’s 2020 Strategic Plan and its emphasis on a computational approach to scaling up treatment delivery and monitoring. Successful execution will provide automated, scalable CBT fidelity feedback for the first time ever, supporting high-quality training, supervision, and quality assurance, and providing a core technology foundation that could support a range of EBPs in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE Evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are increasingly emphasized in professional practice guidelines, taught in training programs, sought out by consumers, and valued by payers. Yet, at present, there is no scalable method for evaluating CBT fidelity to support training, supervision, and quality assurance in community practice settings. The current study will develop and evaluate a clinical support software tool (LyssnCBT) that uses speech signal processing and machine learning to automate CBT fidelity and support high-quality CBT supervision and service delivery in community settings.",Enhancing the quality of CBT in community mental health through AI-generated fidelity feedback,10324974,R42MH128101,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Dropout ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Professional Practice ', ' health care professional practice ', ' healthcare professional practice ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' skills ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' behavioral health ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Provider ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' telehealth ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Community Practice ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost efficient ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' speech processing ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' Secure ', ' signal processing ', ' cloud based ', ' phase II trial ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' software as a service ', ' dashboard ', ' service delivery ', ' practice setting ', ' randomized effectiveness trial ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' services as usual ', ' ']",NIMH,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R42,2021,459739,WA-07
"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),10129429,P50MH115846,"['Accounting ', ' Attention ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' North America ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Discipline ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Policies ', ' data quality ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' faculty community ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' Psychoses ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2021,1640084,MA-05
"Mental Health Research Network III Practice-based research has the potential to dramatically improve the speed, efficiency, relevance, and impact of mental health clinical and services research. Realizing those gains will require a practice-based research network capable of anticipating and adapting to changes in mental health care delivery, including: • Research fully embedded in real-world practice • Alignment of research goals with priorities of patient and health system stakeholders • Large-scale data infrastructure available for rapid analysis • A culture of trust and transparency to facilitate collaborative learning and improvement We propose to expand the existing Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) to include 14 research centers embedded in health systems serving a combined population of over 25 million patients in 16 states. MHRN infrastructure will be enhanced to support a next-generation practice-based network, including: • Increased engagement of patients, health system leaders, and other stakeholders in network governance • An expanded public, open-source library of software tools and other technical resources • More formal processes for conducting feasibility pilot projects and rapid response to stakeholder queries • Expanded outreach to external stakeholders and research partners This Overall application requests support for an Administrative Core, a Methods core, and four research projects. The Administrative Core will support all network activities, including ongoing affiliated research projects, new research projects proposed in this application, and new projects developed during the coming funding cycle. An Organizational Unit will include executive leadership, governance, strategic planning, and responsibility for financial management and regulatory compliance. An Outreach and External Collaboration Unit will be responsible for stakeholder engagement and developing collaborations with new research partners. An Emerging Issues Unit will support timely responses to emerging scientific and public health questions. The Methods Core will support optimal use of existing methods across all network research and develop new methods to address high-priority public health questions. An Informatics Unit will maintain and improve network data infrastructure and disseminate network-developed informatics resources. A Scientific Analysis Unit will focus on improving the methodologic rigor of network projects and development of innovative analytic methods driven by stakeholder needs. These infrastructure resources will support two Signature research projects (a pragmatic trial of eHealth interventions for perinatal depression and a real-time evaluation of new medications to address suicide risk) and two Pilot research projects (an investigation of stakeholder perspectives on implementation of suicide risk prediction models and a pilot trial of outreach to reduce disparities in depression treatment initiation). The Mental Health Research Network will conduct practice-based mental health research in large healthcare systems serving over 25 million patients in 16 states. Infrastructure will include an Administrative Core responsible for governance, communications, and fostering research collaborations as well as a Methods Core responsible for advancing methods in mental health informatics and analytic methods.

"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training).

"CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies Psychosis resulting from schizophrenia spectrum disorders and major mood disorders is one of the most disabling health concerns worldwide. Evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as standard of care by national psychosis treatment guidelines but are rarely accessible. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is the most well-researched psychotherapy for psychotic disorders, yet fewer than 1% of American mental health providers are trained in this intervention. To date, there has been no scalable way to offer high-quality and sustainable CBTp training to mental health providers. The primary objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal is to develop and evaluate a spoken language technology tool – CBTpro -- to support high-quality skills training in CBTp. CBTpro will provide a rapid means of scaling and sustaining CBTp in routine care settings across the US, resulting in more clinicians across the country providing higher quality CBTp to individuals with psychosis. This fast-track STTR proposal has two phases. The objective of Phase I is to develop a CBTpro prototype, which requires three core activities: Aim 1: understand community stakeholder needs to inform software design and functionality; Aim 2: develop CBTpro digital content; and Aim 3: train and validate machine learning algorithms to automatically score CBTp fidelity. The objective of Phase II is to optimize and test the CBTpro tool in real world practice settings. Accordingly, in Phase II, we will Aim 1: conduct a lab usability study (Aim 1a) followed by field testing of the CBTpro prototype (Aim 1b) with 20 trainees; Aim 2: conduct a randomized controlled trial of CBTpro training vs. training as usual (N= 100 providers / N=300 clients), using a nested mixed model analysis to determine the effect of CBTpro on client symptoms, functioning, and recovery; and Aim 3: adopting an NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, assess the hypothesized mechanism by which CBTpro affects clinical outcomes through increased provider fidelity to CBTp (mediation), and test whether the strength of the relationship between these variables is affected by client skill acquisition (moderation). This proposal directly addresses the National Institute of Mental Health’s strategic objectives to improve dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services (Objective 4.2) and develop innovative models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services received (Objective 4.3), particularly through the use of novel technology. CBTpro has the potential to reduce the high personal and societal costs associated with serious mental illness, redress the challenges of training amidst high rates of mental health system turnover, support supervisors in quality assurance and improvement efforts, and reduce health disparities associated with mental health workforce shortage areas. Evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended by national psychosis treatment guidelines, but are inaccessible in routine practice. The objective of this proposal is to systematically develop, pilot, and rigorously test CBTpro, a novel clinician support tool designed to train community mental health workers to provide cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis skills to their clients.

"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond. This project continues a successful program of research on the brain mechanisms of placebo effects, taking the work in new directions critical for understanding mental health.",The neural bases of

"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals March 11, 2021 Michael C. Freed, Ph.D. Chief, Services Research and Clinical Epidemiology Branch Division of Services and Intervention Research National Institute of Mental Health / NIH Office: 301.443.3747 Email: michael.freed@nih.gov RE: Statement of Candidate Eligibility for a Diversity Supplement to R34 MH119411 (PI: Sadaaki Fukui, Indiana University) Dear Dr. Freed, I am submitting a request for an NIH Diversity Supplement to my parent grant R34. This supplemental request is to support Dr. Eric Kyere who is an assistant professor at Indiana University (IU) School of Social Work. Dr. Kyere is eligible for a diversity supplement as a permanent resident who is originally from Ghana. He is a highly motivated scholar aiming to advance racial equity and justice, making him an ideal candidate for this supplement. Dr. Kyere, who is also a racial minority in the United States, is very passionate about understanding the mechanisms and factors of structural racism and identifying methods to tackle the issue. In order for him to continue his research efforts, he has been preparing for tenure at IU. This diversity supplement is an excellent opportunity to help Dr. Kyere reach his career goals as we describe in the attached proposal. Our supplement research goal (i.e., addressing the racial disparities in the mental health workforce) strongly aligns with the current NIMH strategic plans for strengthening the academic and mental health workforce by recruiting and retaining people from diverse backgrounds. Ensuring the success of diverse academic faculty is critical not only for the minority faculty member but also for us to recruit more diverse students and trainees who eventually will diversify our mental health workforce. Our effort ultimately could improve service access and quality for our minority clients. The supplement will help facilitate Dr. Kyere’s career development as he applies his knowledge and skills to a new project under Aims 2 and 3 of the parent R34 and develops preliminary data that will help him be more competitive for external funding. He will apply for tenure and promotion at IU during the 2022-2023 academic year, and the timing of this award will be ideal. To support his career goals through this diversity supplement, we have created supportive environments to provide quality mentoring. We appreciate your consideration of this proposal. Please let me know if you need additional information. Sincerely, Sadaaki Fukui, PhD., MSW., MA Steven Allen Martin Associate Professor Associate Vice President for Research Administration Indiana University Indiana University School of Social Work Candidate Statement  Eric Kyere, Ph.D. Introduction I am excited to apply for an NIH Diversity Supplement through Dr. Fukui’s R34 grant: Developing a data-driven management system using machine learning and mixed-methods research to predict job turnover among mental health professionals. Under the mentorship of Dr. Fukui, the Diversity Supplement will enable me: (1) develop an in-depth understanding of the experiences of Black employees who provide direct mental health services, and particularly, how they conceptualize their experiences in relation to their decision to stay or leave their organization; (2) increase my statistical knowledge and skills in sub-population data analysis; and (3) strengthen my research portfolio by establishing my expertise in addressing the potential racial disparities in the mental health workforce among persons of African descent. My ultimate goal is to promote a just, fair, and equitable world. The successful completion of work undertaken through Dr. Fukui and his team’s mentorship will improve my ability to secure tenure and sustain my research efforts for addressing structural racism against mental health workers of African descent. Structural racism in the workplace may also affect the health and well-being of their client systems and ultimately society at large. The Diversity Supplement is a great opportunity for me to achieve my research and professional development goals. I am an Assistant Professor at the Indiana University School of Social Work and an Adjunct Professor in the Africana Studies Department at Indiana University. As an immigrant of African descent, originally from Ghana, my research focuses on racism and race (grounded in the racial disparity’s framework), examining the various ways that structural racism may impact the psychosocial, health, and overall well-being of persons of African descent or Blacks, and developing innovative solutions. My professional experiences within mental health organizations, as well as ongoing community engaging research within Black communities, have shown me that the workforce (especially in mental health organizations) has a critical impact on how structural racism affects the psychosocial, health, economic, and overall well- being of Blacks within the organization. Such racial disparities in the mental health workforce in turn may create gaps in mental health organizations’ abilities to serve increasing-diverse client systems. African Americans have been engaged in a series of struggles against cascading racial oppressive forces (including slavery, domestic terrorism, Jim Crow segregation, intentional economic subordination, and racialized mass incarceration) over the course of centuries. Research Gaps As I continue to develop my research agenda with a strong focus on structural racism, I recognize African Americans have made significant strides in several domains of life; however, very visible and vexing racial inequalities (in psychosocial, economics, and health outcomes) persist within the mental health domain and impact performance and retention of Black and other workers of color. Moreover, while structural racism has been suggested as the fundamental driver of racial disparities in the job retention rate and health of Black workers, research has still understudied and undertheorized the impact of structural racism, especially in mental health organizations. Additionally, research, which has examined interpersonal racial discriminations against Blacks in the workplace, is limited when providing rich contextualized experiences that highlight the nuanced realities of racialized experiences of Blacks who work within mental health organizations. From an evolutionary standpoint, structural racism and how it operates are dynamic and respond to the vicissitudes of time. However, there are gaps in the research, since current approaches to measuring and analyzing racism continue to rely on more overt forms of racism. This way of investigating racism limits our ability to accurately measure racism, especially structural racism in the post-Civil Rights era, which in turn constrains our ability to generate relevant knowledge to inform solution-based decisions that address racism within organizations. This Diversity Supplemental grant, under the supervision of Dr. Fukui and his team, will provide me with the opportunity to apply qualitative methodologies to an in-depth investigation of the impact of structural racism with which Black employees (who provide mental health services in mental health organizations) have to contend. We anticipate that the findings will inform policy and practice intervention to enhance organizational culture and conditions for Black and other employees of color to improved job retention and work performance. Under Dr. Fukui’s mentorship, I will work with the research team on the R34 grant, which includes graduate research assistants, to develop qualitative interview protocols and conduct interviews and analysis to identify ways racism operates through organizational processes to affect Black employees’ decisions about their job retention and turnover. I also will analyze the administrative and survey data that have been or will be collected in the parent R34 in order to understand the potential racial disparities that disproportionately affect Black employees. We have planned several sub-population analyses to address our research hypotheses. Research Interests to Address the Gaps As a junior researcher on a tenure track position at the Indiana University School of Social Work, it is important for me to strengthen my research focus on structural racism and its impact on Blacks. It is also important to secure external grants to generate research knowledge that offers innovative solutions to structural racism toward persons of color and in society at large. As part of achieving this goal, I will use the data that will be gathered from the qualitative and quantitative inquiries from Dr. Fukui’s R34 in order to apply for an NIMH grant to work with Dr. Fukui and the research team. Our planned proposal will address structural racism that may impede inclusive and diverse work environments and undermine people of color’s productivity and job retention within mental health organizations. I just completed training on Group Concept Mapping (GCM): a community-based participatory research that uses social dialogue to engage with research participants to generate insights on community concerns and potential solutions (e.g., anti-racist framework), identify implementation strategies, and develop evaluation plans that represent the voices of the stakeholders affected by the problem (in our study, Black employees within mental health organizations). I am planning to use GCM as a core methodology for our planning grant. Securing external grants will enhance my prospect for tenure at my school and position me to advance research on racism and race to serve the Black community and promote racial justice. Our planning studies could contribute to building a diverse and resilient workforce and ultimately the vitality of a racially diverse society, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH strategic plans. My Educational and Training Background My PhD education has provided me with strong methodological and analytical frameworks (e.g., quantitative, qualitative methods, critical institutional analysis) from transdisciplinary perspectives to engage with organizations and individuals in order to understand the nuanced ways by which structural racisms (through institutional or organizational cultures) may affect persons of African descent. They include the various coping and resistance strategies Blacks initiate to resist or cope with their racialized experiences. My research approaches have been focused to identify and interrupt the mechanisms by which racism revives itself through institutions/organizations and fostering a working culture that is responsive to persons of African descent in order for them to thrive, thereby increasing their effectiveness and productivity. However, since my doctoral graduation and joining the faculty at the Indiana University School of Social Work, my work has mostly focused on quantitative secondary data analyses using publicly available data and conceptual methodologies. Further, I have not had the opportunity to collect original data or conduct research within externally-funded projects. Acquiring the procedures and conducts of externally funded research is critical for me to grow as a researcher and to become a future research mentor in this field. Importance of Mentorship I am, therefore, highly motivated and excited to submit this Diversity Supplement grant. The proposed training fellowship, under the mentorship of Dr. Fukui and his team, will provide me with the opportunity to work with the research team on the parent R34 grant to apply my knowledge and skills to understand the experiences of Black employees regarding turnover and retention and to use the data in order to inform the creation of an inclusive work culture that is grounded in the racial disparity framework (e.g., understanding the vast differences, which are unrelated to individual and biological traits, that exist in the experiences, psychosocial, health, and performance of persons of color compared to Whites). Race conscious (rather than colorblind) policies and practices are critical to identify, validate, and address these differences. Dr. Fukui is one of the senior colleagues who is committed to the development and retention of junior faculty at the Indiana University School of Social Work. He has provided me with critical feedback on research, manuscripts, and grant writings. I have worked with him on several manuscripts and grant applications. One of our manuscripts that investigated the impact of racial discrimination on African American youth’s depressive symptoms was recently published. While my work has not been directly on Black employees’ turnover within mental health organizations, my related experiences working in the mental health field as well as my ongoing research and engagement with persons of African descent situate me to make significant contributions to addressing racism within mental health organizations, including the significant issue of turnover among employees of color. Most importantly, the Diversity Supplement grant will provide me with secured training time and solid research experiences with Dr. Fukui, given his long-standing research and experience with mental health organizations, his willingness to mentor me, and my passion and motivation to contribute to addressing structural racism. I am excited about this opportunity and look forward to a favorable decision on this application for my professional development and growth. Summary The Diversity Supplement will secure the quality mentoring time and experiences with Dr. Fukui and his team that will be critical for me to develop my expertise in addressing racial disparities in the mental health workforce.

"UZIMA-DS: UtiliZing health Information for Meaningful impact in  East Africa through Data Science PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Component Africa is the youngest continent in the world, with 60% of its population under the age of 25. The span between early life to young adulthood represents a critical window where biological, environment and psychosocial events can significantly impact long- term uzima, which means health/well-being in Swahili. Coupled with the recent technological advances and the enormous volumes of data collected in Africa, there is an unprecedented opportunity to leverage data science to identify and improve the health trajectories of young Africans. However, significant analytical and computational barriers persist that impede our ability to use this information to change care at the community and individual level. Our proposed Research Hub, UZIMA-DS, aims to change this narrative by UtiliZing health Information for Meaningful impact in East Africa through Data Science. We will create a scalable and sustainable platform to apply novel approaches to data assimilation and advanced artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-based methods to serve as early warning systems to address critical health issues impacting young Africans in two domains: maternal, newborn and child health and mental health. Our Hub addresses three critical needs across the translational spectrum of data science: 1) Harmonization of multimodal data sources for meaningful use and analyses; 2) Leveraging temporal patterns of data to identify trajectories through prediction modeling using AI/ML-based methods; and 3) Engaging with key stakeholders to identify pathways for dissemination and sustainability of these models into target communities. For our Maternal and Child Health Study (Project 1), we will leverage the large and diverse existing data sets in Kenya, including two demographic surveillance systems, cohort studies and hospital data, to develop and validate AI/ML-based prediction models to identify women of childbearing age at high risk for poor pregnancy outcomes (e.g., pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birthweight) and non-communicable diseases later in life and children at risk of future poor life outcomes (e.g., developmental delays). For our Mental Health Study (Project 2), leverage existing surveillance data as well as novel mobile technologies (e.g., mobile apps, wearables) for the development of existing and new AI/ML-based prediction models to identify adolescents and young healthcare workers at risk of depression and suicide ideation in Kenya. Our Hub and Projects will be supported by an Admin Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and a Dissemination and Sustainability Core, which will facilitate engagement with multisectoral stakeholders to identify sustainable model dissemination pathways into target communities. Ultimately, our work will empower African researchers to carry forward the UZIMA-DS Hub to address on-going and evolving health needs of Africans by building sustainable infrastructure, expertise, and partnerships for long-lasting impact. The UZIMA-DS Hub can serve as a model that can be scaled to other countries and health domains with the greater DS-I consortium to transform care delivery in Africa, ensuring that current and future generations of Africans can achieve uzima. PROJECT NARRATIVE – Overall Component Our proposed Research Hub, UZIMA-DS (UtiliZe health Information for Meaningful impact in East Africa through Data Science) will create a scalable and sustainable platform to apply novel approaches to data assimilation and advanced artificial intelligence/machine learning-based methods to serve as early warning systems to 1) improve health outcomes for at-risk mothers and children and 2) improve mental health outcomes for at-risk adolescents and young adults in Kenya. We will bring together method experts in statistics, computer science, and informatics, health domain experts and practitioners, and partnerships with key stakeholders to not only improve the quality, efficiency, and relevance of multidisciplinary data science in health research, but also its transparency, reproducibility, and dissemination for sustainable impact in Africa. Thus, helping ensure current and future generations of Africans can achieve uzima (health/well-being in Swahili).",UZIMA-DS: UtiliZing health Information for Meaningful impact in  East Africa through

"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,10194380,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Names ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Physicians ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Brain scan ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' computer science ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Graph ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' Scheme ', ' Update ', ' Preparation ', ' Text ', ' neuroinformatics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' system architecture ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' mental function ', ' brain circuitry ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network classifier ', ' diagnostic platform ', ' diagnostic system ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38222,CA-18
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,10067382,R01MH114028,"['Accounting ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Methods ', ' Morals ', ' Motivation ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Paraphilias ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Societies ', ' Suggestion ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Work ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Self Perception ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mind Research ', ' Mind/Body Research ', ' mind-body research ', ' mind/body method ', ' Mind-Body Method ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' callous unemotional trait ', ' callousness ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' neglect ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavioral inhibition ', ' Outcome ', ' independent component analysis ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' data structure ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' neural patterning ', ' aggression prevention ', ' prevent aggression ', ' Secure ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Social Processes ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' trait impulsivity ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' symptomatology ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' ']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2021,680832,NM-01
"Sensing Technologies for maternal depression treatment in low resource settings (StandStrong) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a high global burden of untreated postpartum depression. Untreated postpartum depression presents acute and long-term risks to a mother's mental and physical health, as well as her child's survival, health, and development. Although there is increasing willingness among funders and health systems to involve non- specialists, such as community health workers, in the delivery of psychological interventions for postpartum depression, the outcomes of these non-specialist interventions have been mixed. Digital technology, specifically the use of passive sensing data collection to learn more about a mother's life and support behavior change, has the potential to improve the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered by non-specialists. For the proposed R21/R33, we will build on preliminary development work of Sensing Technologies for Maternal Depression Treatment in Low Resource Settings (StandStrong) to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and functionality for postpartum depression treatment in Nepal. StandStrong is a digital platform consisting of two mobile apps, internet-of-things (IoT) passive sensors, and a data analysis engine built using modern machine learning approaches. StandStrong incorporates passive sensing data collection from mothers and their infants that can be monitored by non-specialist counselors and then incorporated to better personalize psychological treatment. For Aim 1 (R21 phase), we will use human-centered design to iteratively refine the StandStrong platform and associated implementation material. For Aim 2 (R21 phase), we will evaluate the StandStrong platform and associated contents according to acceptability, feasibility, usage, benefit, and validity. If milestones are met for the R21, we will proceed to the R33 stage, in which we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a psychological treatment as usual with the psychological treatment supplemented by the StandStrong passive sensing platform with 112 depressed mothers (56 in each arm). For Aim 3 (R33 phase), we will identify parameters for sustainability and scalability through engagement of policy, healthcare, and telecom stakeholders, as well as costing the intervention and building mHealth research capacity. Successful completion contributes to the NIMH's 2020 Strategic Plan to tailor existing interventions and develop innovative service deliver for diverse populations.

"Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Project summary The untreated burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States is a massive contributor to healthcare budgets in both the military and civilian sectors, and better treatment and prevention methods are needed. Fortunately, awareness of PTSD among military service members has grown in recent years, and yet, there is a hidden epidemic of PTSD among civilians and women. Women experience PTSD at about twice the rate of men (11% vs. 5%), but the causes for this sex difference are largely unknown. It has long been suspected that sex hormones play a major role in development of – and also potentially protection from – PTSD and other mental health disorders. This project will provide the largest ever study of sex hormone effects on PTSD and the related mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety disorders. Whereas studies in the past were limited by small sample sizes and results were inconclusive, this investigation will use a massive sample size of approximately 500,000 participants to answer questions about two well-known sex hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and three psychiatric outcomes (PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders). These variables were measured in the UK Biobank, and we have been granted access to the data to study sex hormone effects on mental health outcomes and to study genetic effects underlying both sex hormone levels and mental health disorders. The completion of this work will reveal whether rates of mental health disorders vary with testosterone and estradiol levels. It may be the case that levels of hormones that are both too high and too low are problematic. Given this reality, we will use sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques, and therefore we will be able to detect linear and non-linear relationships between sex hormones and PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The sample size and study design make this the most powerful study conducted to date, and the results will be generalizable to diverse populations. In addition to the outcomes mentioned above, we will further explore genetic effects underlying relationships between sex hormones and mental health disorders. To do this, we will conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of both testosterone and estradiol. We will then make polygenic scores for testosterone and estradiol, yielding genetic proxies of sex hormone levels which can be used in studies in which sex hormones have not been measured. Finally, we will test for shared genetic effects between genetic effects on sex hormones and genetic effects on psychiatric disorders in order to better understand the etiology of these common, debilitating, and inadequately treated mental health disorders. Taken together, these findings will provide critical foundational knowledge relevant to clinical trials which are currently testing testosterone and estradiol as treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These results will also provide actionable findings for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Sex hormone altering medications are prescribed to over 40% of American adults, and yet the mental health consequences of sex hormones are still poorly understood. This project will be the largest ever investigation of sex hormone effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety disorders, and the results of this powerful study design will provide much-needed information relevant to the development of new treatment and prevention strategies. The precision medicine approach used here relies on biomarkers and results will be tailored to individuals.",Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),10238943,R01MH123486,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Budgets ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Learning ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' military population ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' sex steroid ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Testing ', ' Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' post-menopausal ', ' postmenopausal ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Exclusion ', ' Prevention ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' interindividual variability ', ' interindividual variation ', ' service member ', ' military member ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' psychiatric genomics ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' military service ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,394572,CA-18
"Risk modeling and shared decision making for postpartum depression PROJECT ABSTRACT Postpartum depression (PPD) is a strikingly common and potentially life-threatening mental health condition, affecting 1 in 5 mothers in the US. PPD poses serious health concerns, not only to mothers but also their children and the family. PPD has been associated with increased infant mortality, higher rates of hospitalizations, impaired mother-child attachment, developmental problems in children, and increased stress within families. However, in reality, women who are at high risk for depression during the childbearing years are usually neither identified nor treated. In addition, even when depression is detected by health professionals, women rarely obtain assistance, despite the wide availability of treatment choices. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to develop automated, scalable risk prediction models for PPD. We will also develop a digital shared decision-making (SDM) tool for PPD treatment by working collaboratively with healthcare providers and patients. The PPD risk model and the digital SDM tool for PPD treatment developed in this STTR Phase I project will be used to conduct a future large, prospective, multi-site clinical effectiveness trial to test their feasibility and utility in routine clinical care of women during the postpartum period. PROJECT NARRATIVE Postpartum depression (PPD) is a strikingly common and potentially life-threatening mental health condition, affecting 1 in 5 mothers in the US. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of PPD can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will use big clinical data and shared decision-making techniques to develop a digital health platform for identifying and treating patients with PPD.",Risk modeling and shared decision making for postpartum depression,10252153,R41MH124581,"['Affect ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Conceptions ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Health Insurance ', ' Gynecology ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Iris ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Businesses ', ' Decision Aid ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' No hope for the future ', ' hopelessness ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Postpartum Depression ', ' Post-Natal Depression ', ' Post-Partum Depression ', ' Postnatal Depression ', ' disability ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' motherhood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' novel ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' child birth ', ' Childbirth ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' digital ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' child bearing ', ' bear children ', ' bearing children ', ' childbearing ', ' Impairment ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' effectiveness clinical trial ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' shared decision making ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' depression prevention ', ' screening ', ' Patient risk ', ' project-based learning ', ' project-based curriculum ', ' support tools ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' treatment choice ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' software as a service ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' practice setting ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' risk prediction model ', ' digital health ', ' ']",NIMH,IRIS OB HEALTH INC.,R41,2021,444962,NY-17
