"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,10131844,K01HL141637,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Critical Care ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' survivorship ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Perceived quality of life ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Impaired health ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Population Sciences ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' patient expectation ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' intervention cost ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,174917,MD-07
"Characterizing clinical and biologic features of persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) requiring mechanical ventilation is a common, costly condition with high mortality, yet treatment remains supportive. Identifying effective targeted therapeutics in heterogeneous conditions like AHRF depends on characterizing subsets, or sub-phenotypes, of patients with high likelihood of disease related events or response to therapy. This project will characterize a novel sub- phenotype called persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure (PHRF) among mechanically ventilated AHRF patients, with PHRF defined by ongoing mechanical ventilation and hypoxemia on ICU day 3. Using clinical trajectory to define sub-phenotypes in other heterogeneous syndromes has helped delineate patients with distinct prognosis and highlight biologic mechanisms contributing to trajectories. With large, independent prospective ICU cohorts from the University of Washington and Vanderbilt University, Dr. Sathe will address the following aims: (1) identify clinical factors on ICU day 1 associated with PHRF (2) determine biologic features of PHRF by analyzing ICU day 1 and day 3 circulating biomarkers of lung injury and (3) develop and validate a multivariable model that predicts PHRF on ICU day 3. Understanding risk factors for PHRF will help hone in on the early mechanisms important for pathologic responses to lung injury. Advantages to sub- phenotyping within AHRF rather than ARDS (where prior efforts were focused) include expanding the scope of patients we target for therapy and improving reliability of study definitions. In addition, discriminating between patients who will and will not develop PHRF will aid clinical prognostication, resource allocation, and targeted trial enrollment of patients unlikely to improve with existing treatment. The results will fill key knowledge gaps prioritized by the NHLBI regarding which factors determine risk for persistent hypoxemia, and the degree to which these factors overlap across ARDS and other conditions in AHRF. Candidate/Environment: With the support of the University of Washington, Dr. Mark Wurfel, Dr. Catherine “Terri” Hough, and biostatistician Leila Zelnick, PhD, this award will help establish Dr. Sathe’s career as a translational physician-scientist practicing Pulmonary and Critical Care. Through the proposed research, she will develop fundamental skills for analysis of longitudinal cohort data, contemporary machine learning methods for prediction, and high-quality measurement and analysis of lung injury biomarkers. This work will identify biologic pathways for more in-depth study in prospective AHRF cohorts, which she will pursue in a future K23. She plans to establish a career examining the heterogeneity of acute respiratory failure and other ICU syndromes, to advance the development of targeted therapeutics for critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The heterogeneity of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), which includes such conditions as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia, has hampered the identification of effective, targeted therapeutics. Characterizing a subset of mechanically ventilated AHRF patients with persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure (PHRF) will help identify patients unlikely to improve with existing treatments and early biologic events leading to persistent hypoxemia. Examining the large, reliably defined group of AHRF instead of ARDS may expand who we target for new therapeutics, and clarify how biologic processes overlap across ARDS and other AHRF conditions.",Characterizing clinical and biologic features of persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure,10231616,F32HL158088,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Characteristic ', ' Biological Characteristics ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endothelium ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Learning ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' male ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Research ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Epithelial ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' respiratory ', ' Ang-2 ', ' Ang2 ', ' Angiopoietin-2 ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' response ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Alveolar ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' circulating biomarkers ', ' circulating markers ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' translational physician ', ' translational clinician ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' participant enrollment ', ' patient enrollment ', ' acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ', ' acute hypoxic respiratory failure ', ' acute onset hypoxemic respiratory failure ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2021,79386,WA-07
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,10137995,K01HL136687,"['Affect ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' realtime systems ', ' Records ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Specificity ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Resolution ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' prospective ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' Prevention trial ', ' health data ', ' respiratory health ', ' Data Science ', ' phenotypic data ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' Retrospective cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' risk prediction model ', ' statistical learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' diagnostic platform ', ' diagnostic system ', ' participant enrollment ', ' patient enrollment ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172704,MI-12
"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,10231005,R01HL152083,"['Biology ', ' Bronchoscopy ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lipids ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Proteins ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' lung edema ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Ventilator ', ' receptor for advanced glycation endproducts ', ' AGE receptor ', ' RAGE receptor ', ' advanced glycosylation end product receptor ', ' amphoterin receptor ', ' receptor for AGE ', ' receptor for advanced glycation end product ', ' receptor of AGE ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Epithelial ', ' alveolar epithelium ', ' Lung Alveolar Epithelia ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Sample Size ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' ionization ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' lung failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Alveolar ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapeutic target ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' recruit ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' epithelial injury ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,539888,CA-18
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,10178076,R01HL140362,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' lung edema ', ' Research ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' respiratory ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Data Science ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' strategies for implementation ', ' complex data ', ' ventilation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research ', ' Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science ', ' Consolidated Framework for Implementing Change ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,680901,IL-09
