"EVALUATION OF CORONARY DISEASE BY DIGITAL ANGIOGRAPHY The aim of this porposal is to assess the feasibility of using digital angiography to evaluate the severity of coronary artery disease. Quantitative methods to be studied will include those designed to measure anatomic coronary artery narrowing, myocardial perfusion abnormalities and segmental myocardial wall dysfunction induced by myocardial ischemia. Results will be compared to the computer-assisted method of measuring lesion dimensions from standard contrast angiograms previously developed by Brown, et al.  One quantitative method to be evaluated will involve the use of videodensitometric as well as image border methods for measuring anatomic coronary artery narrowing from digital subtraction angiograms obtained following intracoronary injection of contrast material.  Both methods will be used to measure the minimum lumen diameter (and area) of coronary artery lesions.  We also will attempt to develop less invasive methods for obtaining coronary angiograms and quantitating the severity of coronary stenosis following injection of contrast material into the aortic root.  Image processing algorithms to be evaluated in these low contrast images will include band pass filtering of electrocardiogram-gated images and a two-dimensional background interpolation method.  The accuracy of these methods will be tested in phantom, dog and clinical models.  A second general quantitative method for assessing the severity of coronary artery disease will entail evaluating myocardial perfusion using videodensitometry to generate contrast density versus time curves in myocardial regions supplied by individual coronary arteries.  Data obtained from segments of myocardium supplied by stenotic coronary arteries will be compared to data from segments supplied by non-stenotic arteries.  Studies will be performed in dogs and humans.  The third general method for evaluating coronary artery disease involves the use of digital subtraction angiography to obtain left ventricular angiograms as a means of assessing global and segmental systolic and diastolic ventricular function at rest and immediately following atrial pacing in humans.  The myocardial perfusion and segmental wall motion methods both will be related to the minimum lumen diameter of lesions in coronary arteries supplying each myocardial segment.  If successful, these studies will provide improved methods for assessing the presence and severity of coronary lesions during routine clinical evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

"IMPROVEMENT OF DIGITAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF CORONARY ARTERIES Coronary arteriosclerosis is a leading cause of death in U.S., and it is to a large degree the presence or absence of severe coronary stenoses which determines the risk of death.  Because many patients who suffer from this disease are asymptomatic until their first attack, a safe, inexpensive diagnostic procedure for detecting coronary artery stenoses would be beneficial.  The diagnosis as currently carried out requires that a large catheter be inserted into the orifice of each artery in order to inject opaque dye to make the arteries visible with X rays.  The increased contrast sensitivity of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) permits a less invasive technique involving an injection into the aortic root, a smaller catheter, and reduced dye volumes, but it has been of only limited success largely because of image degradation caused by patient motion during image acquisition.  The aim of this project is to develop and test image processing algorithms for the improvement of digital angiography of coronary arteries.  The algorithms search for a geometrical transformation to produce an optimal registration of two images before subtraction.  They are based on a new application of the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics, a new class of transformation functions, a new method of machine calibration, and new application of search methods developed in the field of artifical intelligence for function optimization.  As a result these algorithms represent the first approach to image registration which is capable of handling true three dimensional warping.  The development and evaluation of the algorithms will be carried out on both a specially designed phantom and on data derived in a new way from patient studies. The patient studies will be acquired during angioplasty procedures in which an inflated balloon and catheter will serve as phantom arteries of known dimensions.  The availability of known phantoms located in the chest on a beating human heart will provide for the first time an opportunity for quantitative evaluation of the success of the image enhancement algorithms in a realistic environment.  Thus, the proposed research will employ new techniques of image registration with a new technique for image evaluation to the problem of reducing motion effects in digital subtraction angiography.
