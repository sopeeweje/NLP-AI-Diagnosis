"STRABISMUS MUSCLE MECHANICS AND MECHANISMS AIMS and METHODS:  Phase I (training):  To develop independent research skills in the science of bioengineering as related to strabismus muscle mechanisms.  The proposed projects are:  (1) an electromechanical device to obtain length-tension data on extraocular muscles without the variability inherent in hand-held instruments, (2) continue development of an ""expert system"" for strabismus diagnosis, and (3) continue computer simulation of specific cases of human strabismus.  Phase II (research):  Proposed projects are:  (1) continuation of the ""expert system"" development, and (2) creation of muscle and nerve prostheses.  The ""expert system will be mostly a programming effort to simulate a strabismologist's analysis of patient data leading to a specific diagnosis and treatment.  The prostheses will be electronic or electromechanical devices intended to replace permanently damaged muscle on nerve.  SIGNIFICANCE:  This work should (1) allow better diagnosis and treatment of specific cases of strabismus and lead to a reduction in the number of re-operations, and (2) lead to technological alternatives to muscle transposition techniques currently used to restore function in oculomotor palsies.

"AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF MUSCLE AND NERVE FIBERS A further continuation of an established, interdisciplinary research effort, between computer scientists and experts in neuromuscular disease, is proposed.  The long range goal of this entire project is to make quantitative morphometric analysis of muscle and nerve fibers more accurate, less tedious, and hence more available for research and clinical applications.  The specific aims of the project are directed towards developing and validating highly automated morphometric techniques to supplement or replace the manual histomorphometric methods that are currently used in the analysis of muscle and nerve biopsies.  Such automated techniques should prove to be more reliable and useful than their tedious and error-prone manual counterparts.  The methodology is sophisticated, computer assisted image analysis, with a strong emphasis on ""artificial intelligence"".  It also involves computer modeling.  Our system scans, digitizes, and analyzes muscle and nerve biopsies directly from slides, with minimal human interaction.  Results are monitored visually and resulting measurements and hard copy images are produced on simple dot-matrix printers.  During the first three years of this project, we determined optimal preparation methods, developed the relevant basic image analysis techniques and tested them on the representative tissue samples.  We also developed a novel measure of type grouping, the CDI, and developed a basic computer model of denervation/reinnervation.  During the last 2.25 years we streamlined and optimized the system to perform in a cost- effective manner, both in a clinical laboratory setting, and in a research production mode.  The model is being used to explore the underlying mechanisms of a variety of denervating diseases.  Now we propose to, (i) continue a series of experiments, applying the techniques, to demonstrate their usefulness in actual research and clinical applications, (ii) to continue explorations with the model, to further the understanding of denervating diseases, (iii) to disseminate the knowledge and understanding of these techniques by developing a central resource for the analysis of muscle and nerve biopsies, at our laboratory, and (iv) to adapt the software system to run first on a microVAX II, then an IBM PC/AT with appropriate display/digitization hardware, in order to make the system ""transportable"" to other laboratories.
