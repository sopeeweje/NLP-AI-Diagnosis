"MASS SPECTROMETRY IN ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY The application of various mass spectrometric techniques to structure elucidation of three classes of biologically important natural products will be studied.  The first group encompasses novel marine sterols, which differ primarily from terrestrial sterols in the nature of their unusual (elongated or branched) side chains.  This feature appears to be of importance in cell membrane function and a detailed knowledge of the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of such sterol types is needed for structural elucidation of novel and as yet unidentified sterols of marine organisms.  Much of this work requires synthesis of requisite sterol reference compounds or synthetic verification of postulated structure.  The second group of natural products deals with the unusual phospholipids isolated from marine organisms.  Much less is known about the mass spectrometric behavior of this biologically important class of natural products as compared to sterols, and we intend to explore this field in detail by comparing different ionization techniques (electron impact vs. field desorption vs. chemical ionization vs. fast atom bombardment) since each is likely to provide special structural information on specific portions of the phospholipid molecule.  Since the novel marine phospholipids are particularly unusual in the context of their unprecedented fatty acid components (usually polyunsaturated), work is also envisaged on the mass spectrometric location of such double bonds in long-chain fatty acids.  Finally, we intend to develop mass spectral procedures (notably through the use of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with hydrogen gas) in the porphyrin field with the aim of accomplishing an as yet largely unrealized goal, namely the location of chemical substituents in the four different pyrrole rings of the prophyrin molecule solely through the use of mass spectrometry.  If successful, this should not only make an important contribution to porphyrin chemistry, but should also help greatly in drug metabolism studies involving cytochrome P-450.

"BIOMEDICAL USE OF PLASMA DESORPTION MASS SPECTROMETRY Biopolymers are key components of living organisms.  The use of 252-Cf-plasma desorption mass spectrometry (252Cf-PDMS) to improve their characterization and detection and study chemical activity can have a significant impact on elucidating structure-function, early detection of disease and the question of biocompatibility of organic implants.  One of the long term objectives of the proposed research is to develop 252Cf-PDMS to the level where it is routinely used for obtaining molecular weights of biomolecules in the molecular weight range from 1000-100,000 u with unit accuracy and pmol sensitivity.  A second long term objective is to develop the use of modified surfaces for selective adsorption as a new dimension in analytical biomedical mass spectrometry.  A third long term objective is to better utilize the fragmentation patterns inherent in the 252Cf-PD mass spectra of biopolymers to determine their sequence.  An additional long term objective is to use 252Cf- PDMS to study plasma protein adsorption on biocompatible surfaces. One of the specific aims of the proposed research is to improve the current 252Cf-PD TOF technology for obtaining mass spectra of high molecular weight species.  A second specific aim is to explore the use of different surfaces to selectively adsorb proteins and polyanionic biopolymers from aqueous solution in a manner that they can be readily desorbed as molecular ions in vacuum.  A third specific aim is to develop a protocol for studying protein adsorption on different polymer substrates with the objective of addressing the question of biocompatibility.  The experimental design and methods for accomplishing the first of the long range objectives and specific aims include the development of a new detector that will give enhanced sensitivity for high molecular weight ions, and the use of energy selection and pulsed fields for background reduction.  For the utilization of surfaces for selective adsorption, four systems for surface modification will be studied.  The first is based on the use of silanol chemistry on thin Si wafers.  The second is based on surface modification of polyethylene terephthalate.  The third is based on the electrochemical doping of electropolymerized poly-3-methyl- thiophene.  For studying protein adsorption and biocompatibility, albumin and fibrinogen will be used as model plasma proteins.  Thin films of different polymers will be prepared by spin casting and a combination of direct protein analysis and 252Cf-PDMS will be used to study the biocompatibility problem.
