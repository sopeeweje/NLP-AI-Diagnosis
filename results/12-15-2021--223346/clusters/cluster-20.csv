"FISH VENTILATORY BEHAVIOR AS A TOXIC'S MONITORING TOOL The long term objective is to develop a fish monitoring tool capable of rapidly screening chemicals for toxicity, protecting public drinking water supplies and wastewater receiving systems, and identifying the causative toxic agent(s).  Non-invasive electrode techniques receive signals from fish generated bioelectric fields.  Electronic components filter the signals generated from independently monitored fish such that the ventilatory components may be amplified and interfaced to a microcomputer. This and other laboratories have demonstrated that, upon exposure to acutely toxic chemical concentrations, several changes occur in the ventilatory components of fish, such as, frequency, amplitude, and gill purge or cough, including three major and eleven subcategories of the types of gill purge.  It is anticipated that the Phase I research will demonstrate that, upon exposure to chronically toxic chemical concentrations, the combinations of ventilatory components occurring will be unique to a given category of the chemical (e.g., concepts of structural activity relationships, heavy metal vs. pesticide, etc.).  Many chemicals that are toxic to humans and other mammilian systems are toxic to aquatic organisms.  If the long term objective is successful, this inexpensive monitoring tool would have commercal applications for the chemical manufacturing, drinking water and wastewater treatment industries, municipalities, and regulatory agencies, as well as the academic research community.

"PRIMATE CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.  These studies follow logically from prior work of our laboratory.  To the best of our knowledge this research program, involving the very close collaboration of chemists, primatologists and bacteriologists to explore and define a chemical communication system in a primate species, is unique in the United States.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN PROCESS PLANT SAFETY The major goal of this proposal is to research and demonstrate new approaches based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards the design of chemical process hazard detection, prevention, and control systems.  Such systems are extremely important for improving the occupational safety of chemical plants owing to the complexity of modern process plants.  Industrial statistics show that even though major catastrophies and disasters from chemical plant failures are infrequent, minor accidents are very common, occurring on a day to day basis, resulting in many occupational injuries and illnesses, costing the society billions of dollars every year.  The proposed project is aimed at the prevention and control of such frequent, day to day, accidental events in the industry. Past approaches in fault diagnostic systems did not properly include the human expert's reasoning strategies and experience and hence were not adequate in efficient and correct trouble- shooting.  We propose to improve this status by designing systems that would have better modeling of the problem-solving process through an appropriate representation of the domain knowledge through the use of causal modeling and reasoning from first principles, similar to human experts, by exploiting some of the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence.  We propose a methodology that aids the development of expert systems which are process-independent, transparent in their reasoning, resilient under unforeseen fault combinations, and capable of diagnosing a wide diversity of faults.  The domain knowledge of the system is based on a library of fault and causal models of process equipments as well as on the physical interconnections between equipment units and causal relationships among process state variables.  The inference strategy uses model-based reasoning for analyzing the plant behavior.  We describe a prototype expert system, called MODEX, based on our methodology.  The system has performed successfully on test cases of prototypical chemical process plants and looks promising.  However, before a successful transfer of this methodology to the industry can be initiated a number of research issues outlined in the proposal need to be resolved by experimenting with larger prototypical chemical plants.

"SYSTEM FOR MACHINE READING OF CHEMICAL SYMBOLS This project will lead to the development of a proof-of-principle system for machine reading and understanding of hardcopy, graphical chemical structures.  This research will provide a basis for developing intelligent input devices for entry of chemical structure data into existing and future chemical information analysis and classification systems.  Such systems have applications for chemical patent searches, chemical design and analysis, and education.  Development of the proof-of-principle chemical structure reader will require a unique blend of current technologies, including electronic imaging, pattern recognition and analysis, and computer handling of chemical information.  The reader will be a microcomputer-based system using a CCD camera to capture page images consisting of chemical structure diagrams.  These images will be digitized and transmitted to the computer where the image data will be preprocessed into a format understandable by pattern recognition algorithms.  The algorithms will transform the data from a collection of graphic elements into chemical structure indices characterizing the chemical.  The specific goal of the Phase I effort will be to develop a system capable of automatically reading chemical structure diagrams from a limited set and correctly identifying the chemical.

"INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR WORKING WITH CHEMICAL DIAGRAMS The proposed efforts initiates research into an integrated tool for research documentation designed around the unique needs and communication language of biochemical researchers.  A computer system called ChemWriter will be implemented in Phase II from the Phase I design.  ChemWriter addresses the need of many health scientists to work with text, quantitative data, and chemical structure diagrams in an integrated fashion.  Existing tools offer only piece-meal and non-integratable solutions.  ChemWriter would enhance the research documentation process, increase researcher productivity, and speed dissemination of important research results.  The design for Chemwriter is developed through a methodology for human-computer interface design originated and successfully applied by the proposed principal investigator.  The methodology focuses on analyzing the functional needs of the specialist in the application domain (i.e., the biochemical researcher), and designing the user interface to fit these needs.  Software 'form' is then designed to the use-oriented function of the interface.  ChemWriter will incorporate elements of chemical intelligence to support and streamline the chemical structure diagram drawing process, and will be largely machine independent through use of the emerging technology of display description languages.  The chief innovation offered is applying a new design methodology to the fundamental information processing problems of biochemical professionals.
