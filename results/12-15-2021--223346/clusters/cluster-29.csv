"SELF-TRAINING, SELF-OPTIMIZING INFRARED EXPERT SYSTEM With the advent of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) instrumentation, IR techniques have seen increasing application in the area of environmental analysis.  Environmental analysis applications of FTIR include the characterization of hazardous waste mixtures and the speciation and quantitation of airborne vapors and gases both in ambient air, vehicular emissions and the workplace.  The most commonly applied method of spectral identification uses forward searching of infrared spectral libraries.  This method succeeds where the compound and the resulting spectrum is pure, or where the spectrum of a commercial mixture is available.  The method fails in the case of the spectra of mixtures that are not stored as mixtures in the library.  Methods of identifying the compounds in the spectra of mixtures, especially in environmental mixtures, have been pioneered by our group, based on the work of Woodruff, et al, and Herget, et al.  This approach was achieved through the use of a three level rule structure for each peak, giving increasing ""goodness"" scores for each peak in successively narrower frequency windows.  At the heart of the programs that are used to accomplish either compound or compound class identification are PAIRS and PAWMI.  This proposal is aimed at research that will enable these programs to self-train and self- optimize.  Specifically, the hypothesis is:  A self-training, self-optimizing expert system can be developed to identify the components of mixtures of environmental significance using infrared spectrocopy.  1.  Optimization of weighting factors for peak goodness based on frequency of occurrence of peaks in each wavenumber window for given training sets. 2.  Optimization of peak window widths for rules containing three peak position windows for each expected absorption. 3.  Incorporation of a program to deconvove overlapping peaks. 4.  Incorporation of the automated rule generator, the automated rule optimizer, the deconvolution and peak picking programs, and the mixture interpretation program into one expert system applicable to both condensed and vapor phase species.  Each of the above specific aims involves basic research into the use of expert systems for spectroscopic analysis.  This research will be conducted using appropriate training sets of environmental significance.

"QUANTIFYING NITROARENE GENOTOXICITY IN COMPLEX MIXTURES The biological activity of nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitroarenes) has ben the subject of extensive study primarily because of the potent mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of some nitroarenes as well as their widespread occurrence in the environment, principally as the result of incomplete combustion processes.  However, most of us are not exposed primarily to individual compounds but rather to complex mixtures both outdoors (emissions from automobiles, power plants, etc.) and indoors (cigarette smoke, heaters, stoves, ovens etc).  The objective of the work proposed in this application is to relate the genotoxic and carcinogenic activities of individual nitroarenes to activities of artificial mixtures and extracts of emission particulates in order to use data for single chemicals to evaluate the risk of exposure to complex mixtures.  The proposed project, which employs both computerized and experimental methodologies, will involve professionals with expertise in chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, artificial intelligence and risk assessment, and with extensive experience in the study of nitroarenes.  Two computerized techniques will be used.  First, Computer Automated Structure Evaluation (CASE), an artificial intelligence program which was developed to predict the mutagenicity of nitroarenes, will be used to identify structural determinants of mutagenicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Second, the Carcinogenicity Prediction and Battery Selection (CPBS) method will used to identify appropriate batteries of short-term tests for screening individual nitroarenes and mixtures and to predict potential carcinogenicity, including carcinogenic potency.  Experimental studies will be directed towards assessing the activities of compounds in mixtures.  Artificial mixtures of pairs of nitroarenes or related compounds, as well as extracts of combustion emissions combined with individual chemicals, will be tested for mutagenicity, metabolic activation and deactivation of mutagenicity, mammalian genotoxicity and metabolic biotransformation.  Three issues will be addressed:  whether activities are additive or are influenced by competition for enzymatic activation, whether inactivating structures identified by CASE represent alternative biotransformation or competition and how the presence of a complex mixture influences the metabolism, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of individual chemicals.  Resolving these questions about the extrapolation from individual components to mixtures would allow data for individual chemicals concerning bioavailability, metabolism, genotoxicity, detoxification and excretion to be used to reduce uncertainty in the assessment of human risk from exposure in incomplete combustion products and other complex mixtures.

BIOLOGICAL MONITORING FOR EXPOSURE TO COMPLEX MIXTURES The proposed work will investigate the patterns of chemical metabolites in the urine of people who have been exposed to chemical mixtures.  The short term objective of this work is to develop methods for measuring exposure to complex mixtures.  The work will involve the measurement of metabolites in urine with the aid of pattern recognition techniques.  The results of pattern recognition will then be used in the quantitation of exposure.  The long term objective of this work is the reduction of occupational and environmental disease by the improved identification and management of chemical exposure.  ,BIOLOGICAL MONITORING FOR EXPOSURE TO COMPLEX MIXTURES,3431163,R03OH002555,"['gas chromatography ', ' industry ', ' occupational hazard ', ' chemical carcinogen ', ' metabolism ', ' biohazard control ', ' halobiphenyl /halotriphenyl compound ', ' environmental contamination ', ' dosage ', ' chronic disease /disorder ', ' acute disease /disorder ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' urinalysis ', ' atomic absorption spectrometry ', ' clinical biomedical equipment ', ' ']",NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R03,1988,19126,0.15681186184231408
