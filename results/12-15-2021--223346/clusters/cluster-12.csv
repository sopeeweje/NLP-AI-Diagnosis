"NEUTROPHIL AND ENDOTHELIAL/EPITHELIAL CELL INTERACTIONS Inflammatory reactions in the airways involve emigration of neutrophils across the blood vessel endothelium and then across the pulmonary epithelium.  It is hypothesized that this inflammatory cell accumulation can lead to altered airway reactivity.  Stimulated neutrophils can produce epithelial injury and/or increased permeability which may provide better access for antigens, mediators, and/or irritants to neuronal and/or humoral trigger mechanisms in the airway.  In this project we will examine the mechanisms involved in four aspects of neutrophils emigration and epithelial injury:  (1) adherence of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium, (2) transendothelial migration, (3) transepithelial migration, and (4) epithelial injury by neutrophils activated on the apical side of the epithelium.  We will used cell culture techniques to study endothelial cells from large vessels and from the microvasculature and epithelial cells from alveoli and large airways.  For many of the studies we will use human neutrophils and human endothelial and epithelial cells.  Adherence will be assayed with radiolabeled neutrophils and with video microscopy with computer assisted image analysis.  Migration will be studied in standard chemotactic chambers and in specially designed horizontal and vertical chambers for measurement of bioelectric properties of the monolayers and their permeability.  Questions to be addressed include the following:   Are there specific sites or macromolecules on endothelial cells or epithelial cells to which neutrophils attach?  Do endothelial cells or epithelial cells produce factors which increase or decrease adherence?  Do neutrophils alter the barrier properties of endothelial and epithelial monolayers during migration?  Our central hypothesis is that endothelial cells and epithelial cells play an active role in neutrophil emigration,and once we know the mechanism for this facilitated movement, new pharmacologic strategies for control of inflammation may be possible.  The mechanism of neutrophil adherence and migration should also be applicable to other inflammatory lung diseases such as pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

"CLINICAL DECISION MAKING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to the study of clinical decision making and the creation of knowledgable expert medical consulting programs.  This application proposes three related investigations:  1. To study the cognitive processes of physicians engaged in clinical decision making by collecting and analyzing transcripts of their volunteered and elicited responses while solving clinical problems; to describe the knowledge representations and problem-solving methods used by physicians in cases involving considerable uncertainty and considerable risk; to study the variation in skills and style of experts by degree of expertise and area of sub-specialization.  2. To develop new methods that allow expert programs to explain and justify their conclusions by arguing from fundamental medical facts and principles and reconstructing the path by which those bases have led to the program's behavior; to improve the application of automatic programming methods to allow the performance program to be generated automatically from these facts and principles.  3. To continue development of a decision analysis and sensitivity analysis system for clinical and policy analysis use on microcomputers; to distribute that system to a limited cohort of clinicians and investigators, and to study its use.

"DENTAL DEMAND AND PUBLIC ORAL HEALTH Dental disease is a serious public health problem affecting all age groups, yet only 41 to 50 percent of Americans visit the dentist each year. Increasing dental demand to improve public oral health requires an understanding of the factors governing demand, but this knowledge base is incomplete.  Relatively little is known about how providers affect dental demand, and models of dental service use have not been tested fully.  The study's purpose is to close these knowledge gaps regarding the process and determinants of dental demand through the following aims:  (1) to determine the effect of providers on dental demand and (2) to determine factor-level effects in a model of dental service use and expenditure.  Subjects will be local dentists and 4,207 sampled Washington Education Association members and their dependents who are covered by Washington Dental Service (Delta Dental Plan).  Data sources are WDS/WEA dental claims, a dentist mail survey and a telephone survey of WEA insureds.  In Aim 1, OLS will be used to estimate provider effects on patient demand within sampled dental practices.  In Aim 2, principal component analysis and OLS will be used to estimate additive, factor-level effects on dental demand among WEA insureds.  Confirmatory factor analysis will be used to test causal models of dental demand.  Study results should lead to both patient and provider interventions for improving public oral health.
