"NEUROANATOMY WORKSTATION AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING This Phase II project will continue the development of two advanced neuroscience and medical imaging workstations, one a low cost system based on the virtual memory SUN-386 microcomputer and the other s high-performance system based on the SUN-4/260 AI workstation, for image analysis, graphical and textual data storage, three-dimensional reconstruction and volume imaging.  The workstations will include provisions for data input from a digitizing tablet, computer microscopy using a light microscope with stepper motor stage, autoradiography analysis with a video camera and light box, and computer tapes of CT (Computed Tomography) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data.  The modeling and reconstruction package will feature solid body graphical imaging, volume rendering and manipulation, and a standardized database format.  The aims of this project are:  1) to port existing software and test capabilities on the SUN systems, 2) to develop volume imaging techniques as useful research and clinical tools, 3) to develop software for a ""neuroscientist's reference"" and 4) to promote the creation of a standard data exchange format for anatomical graphics.

"INVESTIGATION OF PROBLEM-SOLVING & MAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS We propose a five year program of investigation into problem- solving in immunohematology, leading to the development of a knowledge-based decision support system and a prototype intelligent tutoring system.  Initially, the techniques and methodologies of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence will be used in tandem to investigate the problem-solving of practitioners in immunohematology at various levels of expertise.  During this period the knowledge and problem-solving used by individuals performing various interpretation tasks in immunohematology will be described from an information processing perspective.  This description will be performed within the context of the generic task theory of problem-solving, which has proven successful in constructing expert systems in a variety of medical fields.  In order to more fully understand the performance of immunohematologists, both correct/expert performance and error-producing behavior will be modeled.  The resultant models will then be used as the basis for developing knowledge-based systems to support the education and practice of immunohematology.

"SLIT-SCAN LIGHT SCATTER The major goal of this grant is the understanding of slit-scan light scatter signals and the information they provide.  This will be accomplished through the following tasks:  (1) The completion of the addition of low angle forward and large angle light scatter sensors to two multidimensional slit-scan flow systems.  (2) The reassembly of a Correlation System to provide two orthogonal fluorescence images of cells in flow together with fluorescence and light scatter slit-scan contours.  (3) The collection and correlation of slit-scan light scatter and fluorescence contours. Because the two contours are perfectly correlated, this will permit identification in the slit-scan light scatter contour of the exact point at which the cytoplasm and nuclear boundaries of the cell intersect the slit of laser illumination.  Specific cell types will be analyzed to aid in the understanding of the information available from the slit-scan light scatter contours.  Of particular interest are nuclear and cell boundaries together with information on intracellular structure.  (4) The investigation of detector geometry to optimize morphological boundary, clump, internal structure, and orientation information from slit-scan light scatter contours on cells in flow.  (5) The collection and correlation of slit-scan light scatter contours with slit-scan fluorescence contours and two orthogonal fluorescence images of cells in flow. This data will aid in the study and understanding of the effects of cell orientation in flow on slit-scan light scatter signals and the use of slit-scan light scatter signals to provide information on cell orientation in flow, internal structure, multinucleation, and clumping of cells, and the identification of low resolution morphological features.  (6) Increasing the resolution on one system to two microns to permit the study and understanding of slit-scan light scatter information on other cell types of interest. (7) Parallel theoretical studies and guidance to aid in hardware design, study direction, and the understanding of slit-scan light scatter information.  This study is new and unique and will provide information relevant to cancer detection utilizing multidimensional slit-scan instrumentation, as well as be useful in conventional flow cytometry.
