"DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL HEARING FOR THE DEAF The effort to develop artificial hearing systems for the deaf has recently been focussed on tactual vocoders, devices that transduce acoustic energy into vibratory or electrocutaneous signals which are then applied to the skin.  Current tactual vocoders, however, are based largely upon untested assumptions about optimal filter configurations for speech processing.  In a study which carefully controls device variables (through use of software filters and computer driven displays) while systematically varying filter configurations, perception of critical features of the speech code will be studied.  Using psychophysical techniques, the research seeks to describe the tactual perception of speech features based on signals processed through filter banks with linear, logarithmic and composite spacings for both 32 and 16 channel displays.  The studies will:  1. determine discrimination and identification of speech contrasts along various speech-simulating continua for each of the filter configurations;  2. provide an empirical basis for the design of tactual vocoders with optimal filter configurations; and  3. lay the foundations for a miniaturized tactual vocoder design to be implemented in succeeding phases of the work.  This work is directed toward the development and ultimate manufacture of a portable, wearable, cosmetically acceptable, artificial hearing prosthesis for the deaf.

"AN INTERACTIVE BIOMEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSOR/ANALYZER Current morphometry and image analysis systems can be broadly divided into those which display an image and require the user to trace the points or lines considered significant and those which apply complex algorithms to locate significant objects autonomously.  We have developed a prototype of an intermediate type of system in which the user can rapidly indicate the approximate location of significant objects after which the system applies an edge following algorithm to determine the exact boundary of the object. This system will be much faster to use than ""dumb"" morphometry systems and much less costly than ""intelligent"" image analyzers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  This system uses a new VLSI microprocessor specialized for signal processing tasks and innovative image processing circuitry we have designed.  We believe we can design a system of this type to sell for approximately $10,000.  This would bring powerful image processing technology within the reach of many more investigators.

"PHASE II RESEARCH ON SOUND-MAKING PRODUCTS FOR INFANTS The visual ""mobiles"" attached to infant cribs are devices designed to provide the infant with visual stimulation.  There are no devices currently on the market that provide infants with complex and interesting auditory stimulation.  Yet, studies by this research team show that very young infants have a keen sense of hearing and are capable of discriminating fine differences in complex sounds such as speech.  More importantly, our work suggests that infants like listening to speech, particularly when it conforms to the kind of speech that is addressed to them by caretakers. The particular kind of speech has many special properties, and has been given the name ""Motherese.""  Our laboratory research indicates that infants prefer to listen to Motherese over the kind of speech that is addressed to adults.  Moreover, the work shows that the main feature attracting infant attention towards Motherese is its unique acoustic characteristics, indluding an increase in pitch, exaggerated pitch contours, and a slower tempo.  This Phase-I research project proposes to examine the feasibility of creating an ""Auditory Mobile"" for infants--a device that presents Motherese and other complex signals that mimic its salient acoustic characteristics to infants.  The special features of this device include the fact that it is programmable and activated by the infant's vocalizations.  The proposal requests support for research that would further specify the parameters of auditory signals that should be contained in an Auditory Mobile and begin work on the technical problems of speech synthesis and recognition required by the device.

"FISH VENTILATORY BEHAVIOR AS A TOXIC'S MONITORING TOOL The long term objective is to develop a fish monitoring tool capable of rapidly screening chemicals for toxicity, protecting public drinking water supplies and wastewater receiving systems, and identifying the causative toxic agent(s).  Non-invasive electrode techniques receive signals from fish generated bioelectric fields.  Electronic components filter the signals generated from independently monitored fish such that the ventilatory components may be amplified and interfaced to a microcomputer. This and other laboratories have demonstrated that, upon exposure to acutely toxic chemical concentrations, several changes occur in the ventilatory components of fish, such as, frequency, amplitude, and gill purge or cough, including three major and eleven subcategories of the types of gill purge.  It is anticipated that the Phase I research will demonstrate that, upon exposure to chronically toxic chemical concentrations, the combinations of ventilatory components occurring will be unique to a given category of the chemical (e.g., concepts of structural activity relationships, heavy metal vs. pesticide, etc.).  Many chemicals that are toxic to humans and other mammilian systems are toxic to aquatic organisms.  If the long term objective is successful, this inexpensive monitoring tool would have commercal applications for the chemical manufacturing, drinking water and wastewater treatment industries, municipalities, and regulatory agencies, as well as the academic research community.

"ARRAY PROCESSOR FOR MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING A powerful array processor to be attached to our existing VAX 11/780 computer is requested.  This instrument will be dedicated to research in medical imaging and image processing.  Specifically, four projects are proposed, two each in digital radiology and nuclear medicine.  In digital radiology, the goal of the proposed research is to deblur subtraction angiograms by using sophisticated image processing algorithms, thereby facilitating the visualization of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries.  Two distinct processing algorithms will be investigated.  Both of these algorithms are well known in the image processing leterature, but have not yet been applied to large medical images for lack of sufficient computer power.  The nuclear medicine projects have as their goal earlier detection and more accurate characterization of small neoplasms.  In one of these projects, three-dimensional images will be reconstructed from coded-aperture data.  This approach allows true tomographic reconstruction without any motion of the detector or aperture.  The other nuclear medicine project involves automated feature extraction and pattern recognition of liver scans.

"CLONAL KARYOTYPIC EVOLUTION IN HUMAN SOLID TUMORS Detailed cytogenetic banding analysis will be applied to a variety of human cancers to assess directly clonal karyotypic abnormalities.  Sequential chromosome studies will be conducted using a new cytogenetic procedure which samples tumor cells grown in an in vitro bioassay capable of supporting colony formation from a wide variety of human cancers.  Specific time points for sequential analysis will be:  (1)\at diagnosis (prior to therapy); (2)\following cessation of therapy (if measurable residual disease); and (3)\at relapse.  Patients with solid tumors and malignant effusions from breast, ovary, and lung cancer or patients with neuroblastoma will be studied.  The objectives are to assess the clonal karyotypic evolution in primary and metastatic lesions as a response to time and treatment.  Additionally, the karyology of tumor colony-forming cells exposed but resistant to in vitro incubation with various chemotherapeutic agents will be compared to unexposed control cultures. Selective action of these drugs on karyotypic clonal expansion or contraction will be assessed and results compared to measurable in vivo selection at the time of recurrence of disease.

"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.

"ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS IN OCULAR INFLAMMATORY DISEASE The major goals of this proposal are the prevention of blindness and of morbidity associated with inflammatory eye diseases, particularly trachoma and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.  In the studies of trachoma, we will (1) develop improved techniques for treating it, (2) elucidate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis as an agent of systemic illness, particularly childhood pneumonia, in trachoma endemic areas, (3) evaluate new techniques for the rapid, inexpensive diagnosis of chlamydial infections, (4) attempt to further define the immunological response to C. trachomatis infections in trachoma through the use of specific chlamydial antigens.  The hypothesis underlying these studies is that blindness and morbidity associated with endemic trachoma can be prevented, but that will involve new technologies for detection and treatment.  While these studies on ocular chlamydial infection will be directed at practical, applied goals, we also will examine at a basic level the pathogenesis of chronic trachoma.  By defining the antibody response to specific chlamydial antigens and the patterns of cellular response in the eye, we plan to develop a means to identify cases who are at risk of the blinding complications or who will not respond well to chemotherapy.  This knowledge will be needed as a basis for the evaluation of possible subunit trachoma vaccines.  The studies on ocular herpes simplex virus infections will focus on improving the management of this condition by the development of a computer based, artificial intelligence model of HSV eye infections that can be used as an expert consultant for management of herpetic eye disease.  Continued development of this model will elucidate specific problems in the complex management of the disease.

"VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM AND FLUID SHEAR STRESS IN VITRO The structural and functional alterations of vascular endothelium caused by fluid shear stress will be investigated in vitro using cultured endothelial cells and a special apparatus we have developed for producing controlled fluid shear stress.  The apparatus utilizes a shallow cone rotating above a flat plate to produce shear stresses between 10 to the -2 and 200 dynes/cm2; both laminar and turbulent flow conditions can be checked. Additional modifications will provide oscillating and alternating shear stress levels to investigate the response of the cells to shear conditions approximating those existing in vivo.  Specific parameters of endothelial structure and function to be measured include:  growth patterns and growth kinetics; migration and mitosis following injury; cell orientation and morphology; rates and mechanisms of endocytosis; cytoskeletal organization; and interaction with extracellular matrix.  This is a collaborative research effort that draws upon the resources, expertise, and experience of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Vascular Pathophysiology Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital.  The research system to be used in this program, comprised of an accurately controlled fluid shear stress apparatus and well defined cultured endothelial specimens, should yield valuable information on the influence of fluid shear stress on the structure and function of vascular endothelium.

"ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND IMAGE ANALYSIS OF POLYOMA VIRUS Polyoma virus and its polymorphic aggregates will be studied by low-irradiation electron microscopy and image analysis to answer questions about their overall structure, assembly and stability.  Polyoma, a small DNA-containing virus, closely related to SV-40, causes transformation of embryonic or immunologically deficient mouse cells.  We have recently discovered (Rayment, Baker, Caspar and Murakami (1982) Nature 295, 110-115) that the virus capsid is composed of 72 pentameric capsomeres rather than 12 pentamers and 60 hexamers as predicted by the Caspar-Klug quasi-equivalence theory of subunit assembly.  This unexpected result prompts us to examine the packing and bonding specificity of the capsomeres in several polymorphic aggregates of polyoma using low-irradiation electron microscopy and image analysis.  These methods are the most powerful way to study biological aggregates which have not been crystallized in a form suitable for X-ray diffraction.  The molecular weights of intact virions and capsids will be determined using scanning transmission electron microscopy to provide an independent measure of the number of copies of VP1, the major coat protein.

"PROTEIN MARKERS OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA The molecular events associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma are essentially unknown and useful biochemical markers for this tumor are not available.  High-resolution protein separation techniques have been used in preliminary experiments to identify a group of proteins which are associated with the tumor, but absent or significantly reduced in normal renal cortex.  This application has as its long-term objective the understanding of the role these proteins play in the expression of the malignant phenotype and the determination of whether serum, urine, or tissue assays for these proteins are of clinical relevance.  The first specific aim of this proposal concerns the production of monoclonal antibodies to these proteins through the immunization of mice with protein spots cut from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, a recently developed technique.  The second aim deals with the use of these antibodies to help isolate and characterize the proteins as to molecular weight, subunit composition, glycosylation, cellular localization, and tissue specificity. These studies will use two-dimensional electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and immunohistochemical staining.  The third specific aim deals with the evaluation of three established renal cell carcinoma-derived cell lines as model systems.  Quantitative computer-aided pattern analysis will be used to compare two-dimensional gels of the cultured cells and tumor tissue, and immunologic methods will also be used to confirm the presence or absence of the carcinoma-associated proteins in the cultured cells.  Specific aim four will be to determine by immunoassay if any of the carcinoma-associated proteins or circulating antibodies to these proteins are present in the serum of patients with this tumor.  If so, preliminary studies will be initiated to determine the potential clinical usefulness for the detection, staging, or typing of renal tumors.  The studies outlined here should provide fundamental information about the biochemistry, cell biology, and clinical chemistry of a group of proteins associated with renal cell carcinoma and provide the necessary tools and information to pursue one or several of these proteins in greater detail in the future.

"PRIMATE CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.  These studies follow logically from prior work of our laboratory.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms.

"ANALYSIS OF Z BANDS IN HEART BY OPTICAL DIFFRACTION In human cardiocytes, the contractile units are linked together by Z bands. Although specific proteins have been localized in Z band regions of some vertebrate muscles, the organization of these proteins into a filament lattice is unknown.  Z bands vary in width but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods we have been able to analyze Z and bands greater than 90 nm wide in mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and have identified a common structural unit.  Our optical reconstruction studies show that these units are added side-to-side and end-to-end to make a regular arrangement of axial and connecting filaments. However, the entire Z band is rarely a uniform lattice.  Optical reconstructions strongly suggest variation in the arrangement of connecting filaments in the Z band at rest length and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure.  Our purpose in these studies is to further determine the organization of Z band components in both normal and widened Z bands and to relate this organization to proposed functions for Z bands.  A systematic approach for Z band analysis using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques for electron microscopy at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, will be continued.  We will expand our multilevel approach to include studies of Z bands 1)  in normal muscle fixed after repeated stimulation and after fatigue; 2)  in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3)  in isolated myofibrils or Z disc sheets and in developing muscle.  Additional techniques to be used are computerized image processing, protein isolation and separation and antibody localization.  Structural analysis of Z bands in normal and developing muscle should contribute to our understanding of muscle cell function.

"MASS SPECTROMETRY IN ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY The application of various mass spectrometric techniques to structure elucidation of three classes of biologically important natural products will be studied.  The first group encompasses novel marine sterols, which differ primarily from terrestrial sterols in the nature of their unusual (elongated or branched) side chains.  This feature appears to be of importance in cell membrane function and a detailed knowledge of the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of such sterol types is needed for structural elucidation of novel and as yet unidentified sterols of marine organisms.  Much of this work requires synthesis of requisite sterol reference compounds or synthetic verification of postulated structure.  The second group of natural products deals with the unusual phospholipids isolated from marine organisms.  Much less is known about the mass spectrometric behavior of this biologically important class of natural products as compared to sterols, and we intend to explore this field in detail by comparing different ionization techniques (electron impact vs. field desorption vs. chemical ionization vs. fast atom bombardment) since each is likely to provide special structural information on specific portions of the phospholipid molecule.  Since the novel marine phospholipids are particularly unusual in the context of their unprecedented fatty acid components (usually polyunsaturated), work is also envisaged on the mass spectrometric location of such double bonds in long-chain fatty acids.  Finally, we intend to develop mass spectral procedures (notably through the use of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with hydrogen gas) in the porphyrin field with the aim of accomplishing an as yet largely unrealized goal, namely the location of chemical substituents in the four different pyrrole rings of the prophyrin molecule solely through the use of mass spectrometry.  If successful, this should not only make an important contribution to porphyrin chemistry, but should also help greatly in drug metabolism studies involving cytochrome P-450.

"AUTOMATED CANCER CELL DIAGNOSIS BY THE TICAS METHOD The goal of this research is to study high-resolution image analysis of cervical cells for diagnostic assessment of patients.  The discovery of the marker features for the presence of dysplasia or malignant disease expressed in ""normal appearing"" intermediate cells from the ectocervix has affected the very strategy of prescreening for cervical cancer.  If confirmed on a large database of patients, the finding of frank tumor cells could be replaced by the statistical assessment of a limited sample of a patient's intermediate cells to ascertain whether visual review of the patient's sample is required.  Complementing the analysis of marker features in cells coming from normal patients, patients with dysplasia, with carcinoma in situ, and with invasive cancer, a new technique has been developed to measure the ploidy of cells appearing in Papanicolaou smears and histological sections.  It appears that the rapid availability of this new kind of information may add significant, new prognostic dimensions to the diagnostic techniques being developed.  The statistical distribution of the DNA content in individual nuclei has been shown to be significantly correlated with the malignancy of tumors and the patient prognosis.  The high-resolution technique for ploidy measurement is proven to be precise, accurate, and fast.  We have now completed the measurement of 50 cases designated as either dysplastic or having carcinoma in situ.  For each case, this involves the collection of:  (1)\intermediate blue cell images from vaginal, cervical, and endocervical smear preparations; (2)\dysplastic cell images from dysplasia cases; (3)\carcinoma in situ cell images from carcinoma in situ cases; (4)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from the cytology preparations; and (5)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from histological specimens obtained by biopsy.  DNA results are now routinely produced with a variety of parameters that are being correlated with the results of discriminant analysis on the intermediate blue cell populations.

"CUTANEOUS PATTERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the skin's ability to perceive tactile patterns.  Using a vibrotactile array of stimulators that fit against the subjects' fingertips, complex patterns varying in duration, mode of generation, intensity, size, temporal proximity to masking stimuli, and location will be presented to subjects who are required to identify the patterns.  The role of pattern onset in generating vibrotactile contours and the limits of temporal integration of vibrotactile patterns will be investigated.  Measurements will be made of temporal masking functions with patterned stimuli, and a two-factor model of masking will be tested. Spatial factors such as the locus of stimulation and the size of patterns as well as the interaction between these factors and temporal and intensive variables will be explored.  The role of experience in tactile pattern recognition will be examined by testing individuals who have had extensive experience with the Optacon, a reading aid for the blind, with some of the pattern recognition tasks on which sighted subjects have been tested.

To determine what characteristics of patterns provide reliable and rapidly processed units of information, a computer-controlled vibrotactile matrix has been constructed to permit presentation of a wide variety of frequencies, amplitudes, and time relations of tactile stimuli over a spatial display of 64 independently controlled vibrators.  Present explorations of promising pattern dimensions involve serial presentations of patterns for discrimination and identification, but future work will involve pattern production and modification in dynamic simulated environmental representations.

"IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON INDUSTRIAL INSPECTOR STRESS The objective of this research is to determine how both human stress and human performance vary with the level of automation in an industrial inspection job.  Industry is demanding higher quality of its workers and of its inspectors who are charged with maintaining and monitoring that quality.  At the same time, sophisticated automation is becoming available to extend the human inspector's capabilities on some tasks within the inspection job.  Inspection is known to be a stressful job and, with these two trends, a job which is likely to increase in stressfulness.  A machine, called a Color Video Comparator or CVC, will be used to obtain six levels of inspection automation from unaided human inspection through automated display, sequencing and pacing to a pattern-recognition algorithm.  Performance and task stress will be measured in a laboratory task of inspection printed circuit boards for eight subjects at each level of automation.  The procedure follows one already performed successfully at one level for the Western Electric Company.  This company will supply the CVC and the circuit boards used in the study.  Parts of the laboratory study will be replicated using inspectors at two Western Electric plants so that differences between task stress and job stress can be measured.  The results of the project will be of value to designers of automated and semi-automated systems as they will help to specify the level of automation which gives the best balance between system performance and operator stress.

"PROCESSOR CONTROLLED HEARING AID The long term objective of the proposed program is the development, design and manufacture of a signal processor-controlled hearing aid to maintain the overall sound pressure level (SPL) and the spectrum at the eardrum within optimum limits for the hearing impaired individual for allexpected input spectra and input levels.  An additional feature will be an increase in signal-to-noise ratio of the aided signal.  The signal processing will be based on the actual eardrum SPL, determined from an acoustic feedback signal obtained by a microphone or probe in the ear canal.  For all expected input levels, the spectrum of the eardrum sound pressure is controlled by the processor, so that the peak SPL in any 1/3-octave interval does not exceed the individual's loudness discomfort level (LDL) while still maintaining the desired spectrum and SPL at its most effective value.  The processor compares the inputs and outputs for each filter and the gain in each channel is then adjusted (on a real time basis) to obtain the desired output for the band.  Determination of averaging times for both the input and output signals are significant and will constitute a major element in the study.

"NEURO-IMAGING EXPERT SYSTEM It is proposed to develop a computerized expert system for analyzing and understanding the images of the nervous system generated by neuroimaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT).  A prototype version, called RAD (Radiologic Automatic Diagnosis), has been implemented.  RAD will serve as an expert consultant in the field of neuroradiology, as an adjunct to computerized expert systems for medical diagnosis, and as an intelligent image processor supporting automated feature extraction from neuro-images.  Modern neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized the practice of neurology and neurosurgery.  The rapid proliferation of scanners, however, has outstripped the supply of experts with special training in scan interpretation.  If a scanner could produce the differential diagnosis associated with the radiographs, it could aid radiologists in diagnostic tasks.  Images received in digitized form from scanning devices will be segmented into objects after thresholding based on radiodensity (CT scans).  This process will be aided by intelligent histogram optimizers and artifact removal programs.  Analysis will be conducted in an object-oriented programming environment on objects represented in quadtree or octree format.  RAD will employ clinical information, and knowledge bases in neuroanatomy, neuroradiology, neurology, and medicine to establish a context for analysis.  This context will be instantiated in the form of assertions on a queue of beliefs in a truth maintenance system.  Global and local image analyzers will also make assertions about neuro-images.  The truth maintenance system will keep track of any contradictions which arise, and will provide forward chaining and backtracking explanation abilities of the reasoning leading to the differential diagnosis.  At the present time, medical diagnostic expert systems, such as INTERNIST-I/CADUCEUS are dependent for its input upon the physician-user. The ability to directly interact with patient data in neuro-images would enrich the diagnostic foundation of the system and reduce obligate user interaction.

"A ROTATING SLIT SCANNING UNIT FOR DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY The purpose of the research we are proposing is the development of a rotational slit scanning system for digital radiographic applications.  The x-ray receptors will consist of linear photodiode arrays coated with an x-ray phosphor.  The system should be compact and of low cost compared to commercially available linear scanning units.  The spatial resolution imaging capabilities of such a device should exceed one 1p/mm, while offering shorter scan times than conventional linear scanning units.  The benefits expected from such a system would include:  1. significant reduction in the detection of compton scattered x-rays (which will degrade image contrast and increase dose)  2. scan rates sufficient to minimize many patient motion problems  3. an increase in the dynamic range available over that of film  4. adequate spatial resolution for many radiologic applications  Since the same coated arrays may be employed in a linear scan format, direct comparison of image quality between the two scanning formats for the same receptor technology will be possible.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.

"MEDIATORS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT MESSENGER RNA SYNTHESIS Insulin prevents the induction of mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dubutyryl cyclic AMP and hydrocortisone in Reuber hepatoma cells but simultaneously acts in an additive fashion with these agents in inducing tyrosine aminotransferase.  These results imply that these agents interact to promote or inhibit mRNA production from specific genes. Therefore, this project will test the idea that insulin, cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids alter production of specific messenger RNAs in Reuber hepatoma cells by altering the charge, abundance or intracellular distribution of genetic regulatory proteins.  Two model proteins that translocate to the nucleus and are probably involved in transcriptional regulation (the glucocorticoid receptor and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase) will be identified in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (2D-PAGE) of radiolabeled extracts of whole cells, nuclei and chromatin. These proteins will be studied to find whether hormonal combinations that alter mRNA induction alter their activation or translocation to the nucleus.  Activation will be sought as changes in the charge (phosphorylation state or other modification) of these receptors using 2D-PAGE.  Translocation will be detected as decreased association of these proteins with the cytosol and increased association with the nucleus after hormonal stimulation, again identifying the receptors with 2D-PAGE.  Cells will be treated with insulin to identify molecules whose charge or abundance is regulated by this hormone, and a molecule will be sought that becomes associated with chromatin after insulin treatment.  Nuclear events such as translocation of regulatory molecules or altered phosphorylation of histones and other proteins will be identified and attempts will be made to correlate these events with altered production of messenger RNAs.  Events that correlate with insulin's ability to abolish the induction of messenger RNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids, will be pursued.  If a putative regulator is found, I will attempt to purify it, study how it is activated, and determine how it associates with chromatin or DNA.  Knowledge of how protein effectors are stimulated by insulin to regulate genetic events is fundamental to the understanding of long-term changes brought about by insulin, and conversely, of changes expected in the course of diabetes.

Collaborative research will involve two theoretical projects to quantitate the use of additional data, from amino acid composition and from predicted secondary structures, to improve the power of the identification system.  The other two projects involve the examination of new kinds of experimental data to make identifications.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING This proposal is to develop an integrated program for the representation of complex knowledge and reasoning processes in medicine, using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) and decision analysis (DA).  The project will address problems in both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning in two medical domains: coronary disease, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The planned large-scale AI system will incorporate a common knowledge representation formalism and alternative reasoning programs to do data interpretation, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing and revision, diagnostic query planning, therapeutic planning and automatically-generated explanations.  DA reasoning will be integrated into the system, especially to improve the test and treatment planning components.  A uniform knowledge base will be developed in the two identified medical domains, utilizing knowledge acquired from the analysis of protocols, expert opinion, case-based learning, hand-coded knowledge from the literature, and strictly limited attempts to automatically acquire structured knowledge from English free-text.  A panel of specific cases will be developed that can be used to validate additions to the knowledge base and changes in the reasoning components of the system.  A series of protocol analyses will be done, involving both diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in clinical settings where uncertainty and risk are predominant factors.  Specific attention will focus on the degree to which experienced clinicians rely on case-based reasoning and means will be developed to represent, index and utilize such case-based experience in the reasoning program.  A new generation of DA tools will be built to aid the construction of DA models for use in actual clinical settings.  These tools will utilize the same knowledge bases as the AI models, and will share with them the ability to look in varying depth of detail at problems and to generate explanations of their workings.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

"DIGITAL CONTROL OF REHABILITATION/EXERCISE MACHINES The long term objectives of this work are twofold.  First, to develop adaptive machines which can be used effectively in the evaluation and rehabilitation of muscular deficits due to traluma, disuse or disease in a broad spectrum of the population from victims of accidents and chronic musculoskeletal disorders to atheletes and the aged.  Second, to collaborate with health professionals in collecting and analyzing data, using the unique capabilities of these devices, and to establish a database to make these data readily accessible.  Thus, these machines should be versatile, incorporating active as well as passive exercise capacity, and capable of collecting, archiving, manipulating and comparing quantitative measurements from treatment protocols.  The specific aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an intelligent, digital controller, based upon computer architecture widely used and supported in the industrial process control and biomedical communities.  The controller must be capable of accurate, on-line, feedback regulation of previously developed instrumented machines.  The latter permit motion in three dimensions and employ electrohydraulic control of resistance.  To accomplish this specific aim, several steps are required.  Initially, the dynamic performance of the electrohydraulic actuator unit must be characterized using standard control engineering test protocols.  Next, a prototype test system can be assembled by interfacing a minicomputer with one of the instrumented machines and allowing the computer to emulate digital controller functions.  By varying such parameters as sampling rate, data precision and feedback functions, software/hardware constraints will be established.  Finally, a configuration will be outlined specifying the requisite hardware and software components which will provide acceptable control performance.

"BREAST DIAGNOSIS:  QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BY ULTRASOUND The goal of this proposal is to develop and investigate methods and instruments for obtaining reliable quantitative ultrasound images of several acoustic paramenters within two-dimensional coronal cross sections of the breasts of women.  The instrument and associated programs will synergistically combine quantitative multimodal images to obtain diagnoses of breast disease.  Ultrasound computer-assisted transmission tomography will be utilized to obtain quantitative images of acoustic speed, acoustic attenuation, acoustic absorption and scatter and reflection where appropriate.  Both analytic and iterative methods of correcting aberrations in the images caused by inhomogeneous refractive index will be investigated.  Compound B-scan images will also be obtained in the same coronal planes.  Our clinical scanner will be modified to obtain data necessary for high fidelity images derived using newly developed inverse scattering methods.  Patients scheduled for surgical biopsy will be scanned and the resulting images compared to the histology results from biopsy and/or surgical mastectomy.  Comparisons between surgical specimens and acoustic images will be made using methods of automated computer-assisted pattern classification and recognition combined with histological methods of tissue preparation specifically designed to aid in comparing ultrasound images of the coronal plane of the intact breast with similar planes through the excised breast.  This parallel investigation of the clinical instrument, inverse scattering methods, histologic tissue analysis techniques, and pattern recognition programs should result in complete evaluation of the prototype clinical scanner and may result in an instruemnt design capable for use in the clinical environment.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.

"FETAL LUNG BIOCHEMISTRY AND 3-DIMENSIONAL MICROANATOMY During late fetal development, the lung must prepare for the transition to air breathing.  Maintaining alveolar stability becomes vital for survival. Therapy with glucocorticoids to enhance lung maturity may have immediate and long term consequences for lung structure and function.  This series of investigations is directed toward furthering our basic knowledge of lung secretory cell development.  We will use structural and biochemical methods to test hypotheses of secretory cell function and to test the probabilities that glucocorticoids damage fetal and newborn lung structure.  We intend to study biochemical and 3-dimensional morphologic changes during epithelial cell maturation in the last days of fetal development.  We will test hypotheses of the assembly of lamellar bodies and assess the changes in type II cell maturation induced by glucocorticoids.  This drug induced accelerated maturation is a relevant clinical concern as the effects are widespread within the lung and have not been shown to be entirely reversible during postnatal growth.  A detailed 3-dimensional morphologic study of groups of alveolar septa and of terminal bronchiolar structure will be conducted at allow magnification level that will test the microanatomic basis for theories of cell-cell interactions.

"RESEARCH RESOURCE ON COMPUTERS IN BIOMEDICINE The general objective of the Rutgers Resource is to apply advanced methods of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, to problems of biomedical research and practice.  The Resource will promote the developement and use of computer systems for expert consultation in medical diagnosis and management, and for research assistance in processes of scientific experimentation and theory formation.  Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed research.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.  The major areas of biomedical application are in rheumatology, where we are collaborating with Drs. D. Lindberg & G. Sharp at the University of Missouri-Columbia, in clinical pathology, where we are working with Dr. Robert Galen of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in ophthalmology, where we have a major collaboration with Dr. C. Dawson at the University of California-San Francisco.  An important aspect of our research is technology transfer, producing prototypes that will be useful to clinical researchers and practitioners.  We have pioneered developments in this field by putting an expert system on a chip, incorporated in a widely used clinical instrument:  a serum protein electrophoresis analysizer.  We have also succeeded in transferring the large rheumotology consultation knowledge base onto a M68000 microprocessor machine, which will be accessible and affordable to smaller investigative groups and clinicians.  We are proposing to continue these innovations through experimentation with different kinds of microprocessor systems, introducing better graphics and other user-friendly interfaces.  These systems will be tested and evaluated by our biomedical collaborators.  In addition to the research in the Resource, we intend to continue the highly successful dissemination activities of the AIM Workshop series, and the Rutgers participation in national AIM collaborative research.  We are proposing to purchase sufficient workstations for intensive software development in the Resource, and enough microcient workstations for intensive software development in the Resource, and enough microprocessor based systems for testing and diffusion of our prototypes to the AIM community.

"DESIGN OF IMPROVED ACOUSTIC IMAGING TRANSDUCERS The purpose of this work is to greatly improve the performance of ultrasonic imaging transducers.  Improvements are anticipated in range, and clarity of images, especially of chest cavity images, which require the greatest range of clarity.  In addition, greater flexibility and lower noise levels will be achieved through signal conditioning at the transducer site.  these improvements will be made by concerted work in four areas: 1.  Evaluation of new transducer materials and composites.  Literature of piezoelectic materials and devices will be constantly reviewed, and, when results appear to have use in medical imaging transducers, laboratory tests of the materials will be conducted.  2.  Impedance and energy matching of transducers to aqueous media.  Techniques to be investigated include geometric matching, multiple thin layer matching, and cooperative electical matching.  3.  Novel transducer geometries and excitation methods.  Novel transducer geometries include well matched linear and arc sector arrays, radial surface wave devices, and surface wave scanning arrays.  4.  Thin film, thick film, and hybrid circuit technologies.  Included in this category are the fabrication of microelectronic preamplifier circuits on the transducer and the formation of intricate conductor patterns on the transducer elements.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time. Silver and in vitro radiolabeling techniques have been developed to permit visualization of nanogram amounts of protein(s) with applicability to computer technology.  Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.  Lastly, we will continue our technological developments to assure maximum detection, and computer-assisted image-processing of the complex protein patterns that characterize normal and malignant cells in order to confirm and further detect potential hallmark proteins, whose occurrence mark malignant induction.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSES IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN This project is aimed at the development of explicit computational models of perceptual and cognitive processes, relying on mechanism which are consistent with what is known about the physiology and anatomy of the brain.  Recent work simulating perceptual and cognitive processes indicates that this is a fertile path to follow, but to do this adequately I need to learn more about the brain and more about the simulation of the kinds of computational processes which seem consistent with what goes on in the brain.  The first two years of this award would be devoted primarily to obtaining this background, as well as to research applying what I would be learning to a process at the interface between perception and cognition--namely reading.  Before the start of the career development award I plan to obtain some basic background in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and computer simulation techniques used in artificial intelligence.  I plan to spend the first year of the award at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Massachusetts Institue of Technology, studying recent advances in the understanding of parallel computation, and working on the development of a neurally plausible simulation model of the visual aspects of reading.  I plan to spend the second year at the Aphasia Research Center of Boston University at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital, rounding out my background in the neurological basis of cognition and beginning research designed to use the effects of brain damage as a way of finding out about the nature of the underlying processing system. Specifically, I would study the disturbance of word processing ability that arises in deep dyslexia a type of reading disability resulting from damage in certain ageas of the brain.

"IMAGE ANALYSIS OF STAINED AND UNSTAINED MACROMOLECULES The structures of polyoma virus and its polymorphic aggregates, SV40 virus, myosin subfragment-1, and the chloroplast cytochrome b6/f complex will be studied by electron microscopy and image analysis methods.  These studies are aimed at answering questions about the overall structure, assembly, stability, and function of these macromolecular aggregates.  We will learn about protein-protein interactions in polyoma, SV40, myosin subfragment-1, and cytochrome b6/f, protein-nucleic acid associations in polyoma and SV40, and protein-lipid associations in cytochrome b6/f.  The biological significance of each of these systems is well documented. Polyoma and SV40 do not cause malignancies in their natural hosts (mice and rhesus monkeys), but their oncogenic potential is revealed when high concentrations of virus are injected into either foreign hosts or natural hosts lacking a functional immunological system.  Subfragment-1, the head portion of myosin, is responsible for force generation in muscle through the hydrolysis of ATP and interaction with actin.  Cytochrome b6/f, an integral membrane-spanning complex in chloroplast thylakoids, is involved in photosynthetic and respiratory energy transduction.

"AN INTERACTIVE BIOMEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSOR/ANALYZER Current morphometry and image analysis systems can be broadly divided into those which display an image and require the user to trace the points or lines considered significant and those which apply complex algorithms to locate significant objects autonomously.  We have developed a prototype of an intermediate type of system in which the user can rapidly indicate the approximate location of significant objects after which the system applies an edge following algorithm to determine the exact boundary of the object. This system will be much faster to use than ""dumb"" morphometry systems and much less costly than ""intelligent"" image analyzers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.

"COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR DESIGNING CLINICAL ONCOLOGY TRIALS Quantech proposes to develop an interactive computer system capable of assisting statisticians in the design of statistical aspects of phase III clinical oncology trials.  The system will advise the user concerning choices of type I error, power, detectable treatment differences and sample size.  When exact or approximate formulas aren't available, numerical results will be obtained by computer simulations.  The SBIR phase I effort will identify designs in current use for oncology trials, theory for the selection of design parameters, and methods to expedite use of the computer system.  Portability across microcomputers and mainframes will also be ensured in phase I.  The system's feasibility will be demonstrated by creating a preliminary version.  In SBIR phase II, the full set of analytic and simulation procedures as well as convenient methods for command and display will be added to the system while avoiding excessive machine-dependence.  By facilitating access to sophisticated methods for the design of trials with failure-time outcomes, the system will have wide commercial applications among those doing clinical research in cancer treatment, basic biomedical researchers, drug companies, as well as engineers doing reliability studies on physical systems.

"ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS IN OCULAR INFLAMMATORY DISEASES Our goal is the prevention of blindness and morbidity associated with inflammatory eye diseases, particularly trachoma and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.  The studies proposed on trachoma will examine in detail the variations in host response to a single well characterized organism (Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the eye).  It will allow us to evaluate response of the external eye to infection and the variations in disease that are intrinsic or induced (e.g. atopy or depressed cellular immunity.  the grading of host repsonse (trachoma intensity) and microbial load (number of chlamydial elementary bodies) provide a quantitative system to study this interaction of host and environmental factors.  In the studies of chlamydial infections we will (1) initiate studies on the role of individual host response to chlamydial infection; (2) elucidate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis as a cause of other illness in trachoma endemic areas; (3) evaluate new technology for the diagnosis of ocular chlamydial infections; (4) develop and validate simplified diagnostic techniques for endemic trachoma; (5) continue limited treatment trials for the prevention of blindness from trachoms.  The major theme of these studies on trachoma will be an evaluation of the host response to infection of the conjunctiva.  An important intermediate goal will be the identification of those host factors that are associated with the blingind consequences of trachoma.  Herpes simplex virus and other infections of the eye continue to be a major problem, both in the United States and in other countries.  Although treatment of ocular herpes has improved considerably in recent years, the disease continues to cause loss of vision and morbidity in many patients. In order to improve treatment of this disease by ophthalmologists, further refinements will be made in a computer model to provide treatment recommendations for herpetic eye disease.

"KINEMATIC AND CELLULAR STUDIES OF MOTOR CONTROL The main goal is to understand how the central nervous system coordinates the large number of degrees of freedom of the arm.  The experimental approach includes recording and analysis of the kinematics of multijoint movements.  In some cases, a simple mechanical system is used to record the movements.  When full arm freedom is required, an optoelectric recording system is used.  Work will continue on the following projects on multijoint control.  1. Multijoint movements of the right and left arms are being compared.  The comparison includes movements to visual targets, movements which are unexpectedly perturbed, and isometric force production.  2. Studies of the multijoint movements of patients with movement disorders will be continued.  To date, there has been concentration on patients with cerebellar disease and Parkinson's disease.  Simple movements to visual targets have been emphasized.  In the next year, unexpectedly perturbed movements and isometric force production will be studied in these same patient groups, in order to more fully characterize the physiology of these disorders.  3. We are studying the control of multijoint movements in the presence of unexpected mechanical loads.  We recently found that with same load types subjects make movements with the same kinematic characteristics as in the unloaded condition.  This suggests that there may be a mechanism for rapid real-time trajectory corrections, so that we will investigate this motor-compensation mechanism more fully.  4. The multijoint arm stiffness of patients with a variety of central lesions will be compared to that of normal individuals.  By searching for changes in the stiffness due to central diseases, we hope to learn what central structures are involved in stiffness control.

"NEURO-IMAGING EXPERT SYSTEM It is proposed to develop a computerized expert system for analyzing and understanding the images of the nervous system generated by neuroimaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT).  A prototype version, called RAD (Radiologic Automatic Diagnosis), has been implemented.  RAD will serve as an expert consultant in the field of neuroradiology, as an adjunct to computerized expert systems for medical diagnosis, and as an intelligent image processor supporting automated feature extraction from neuro-images.  Modern neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized the practice of neurology and neurosurgery.  The rapid proliferation of scanners, however, has outstripped the supply of experts with special training in scan interpretation.  If a scanner could produce the differential diagnosis associated with the radiographs, it could aid radiologists in diagnostic tasks.  Images received in digitized form from scanning devices will be segmented into objects after thresholding based on radiodensity (CT scans).  This process will be aided by intelligent histogram optimizers and artifact removal programs.  Analysis will be conducted in an object-oriented programming environment on objects represented in quadtree or octree format.  RAD will employ clinical information, and knowledge bases in neuroanatomy, neuroradiology, neurology, and medicine to establish a context for analysis.  This context will be instantiated in the form of assertions on a queue of beliefs in a truth maintenance system.  Global and local image analyzers will also make assertions about neuro-images.  The truth maintenance system will keep track of any contradictions which arise, and will provide forward chaining and backtracking explanation abilities of the reasoning leading to the differential diagnosis.  At the present time, medical diagnostic expert systems, such as INTERNIST-I/CADUCEUS are dependent for its input upon the physician-user. The ability to directly interact with patient data in neuro-images would enrich the diagnostic foundation of the system and reduce obligate user interaction.

"MASS SPECTROMETRY IN ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY The application of various mass spectrometric techniques to structure elucidation of three classes of biologically important natural products will be studied.  The first group encompasses novel marine sterols, which differ primarily from terrestrial sterols in the nature of their unusual (elongated or branched) side chains.  This feature appears to be of importance in cell membrane function and a detailed knowledge of the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of such sterol types is needed for structural elucidation of novel and as yet unidentified sterols of marine organisms.  Much of this work requires synthesis of requisite sterol reference compounds or synthetic verification of postulated structure.  The second group of natural products deals with the unusual phospholipids isolated from marine organisms.  Much less is known about the mass spectrometric behavior of this biologically important class of natural products as compared to sterols, and we intend to explore this field in detail by comparing different ionization techniques (electron impact vs. field desorption vs. chemical ionization vs. fast atom bombardment) since each is likely to provide special structural information on specific portions of the phospholipid molecule.  Since the novel marine phospholipids are particularly unusual in the context of their unprecedented fatty acid components (usually polyunsaturated), work is also envisaged on the mass spectrometric location of such double bonds in long-chain fatty acids.  Finally, we intend to develop mass spectral procedures (notably through the use of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with hydrogen gas) in the porphyrin field with the aim of accomplishing an as yet largely unrealized goal, namely the location of chemical substituents in the four different pyrrole rings of the prophyrin molecule solely through the use of mass spectrometry.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time.

"DEVELOPMENT OF DYNAMIC DIGITAL CHEST IMAGING TECHNIQUES The goal of the proposed research is to develop new dynamic chest imaging techniques based on a digital radiographic system that has a large image intensifier (57-cm)-TV system as the x-ray detector.  The new techniques are distinctly different from existing chest imaging techniques in that they utilize the unique physical characteristcs of the digital system; a large area detector, effective scatter rejection, rapid image acquisition, and computerized image processing.  These methods have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy for detection of pulmonary diseases at reduced patient exposure and risk, as well as at a reduced cost.  The specific aims of this research include:  (1) studies of pulmonary ventilation with non-radioactive xenon gas as the contrast medium, and (2) detection of pulmonary embolism by digital subtraction radiography with or without contrast injection.  The application of dynamic digital techniques to chest radiography can provide quantitative and dynamic data for evaluation of pulmonary ventilation and pulmonary embolism.  Initially, the basic imaging parameters of dynamic chest imaging will be optimized by using Monte Carlo simulation studies based on patient dose, detective quantum efficiency of the image intensifier, contrast sensitivity, and antiscatter techniques.  A beam equalizing filter device will be developed for reducing the dynamic range of the chest radiographs.

"PRIMATE CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.

In ""reconstruction"" we plan to concentrate on finite series expansion methods, methods derived from a semi-continuous formulation, preprocessing of incomplete or distorted data, with applications to CT, PET, and MRI.  In ""display"" we plan to concentrate on segmentation (identification of structures of interest, such as specific organs and tumors, in the 3D space) and on rapid display, analysis, and manipulation of the identified structures, with applications to measurement of volumetric changes in soft-tissue masses, surgical planning, radiation therapy treatment planning, and characterization of the normal, ischemic and scarred myocardium.

"RESEARCH RESOURCE ON COMPUTERS IN BIOMEDICINE The general objective of the Rutgers Resource is to apply advanced methods of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, to problems of biomedical research and practice.  The Resource promotes the development and use of computer systems for expert consultation in medical diagnosis and management, and for research assistance in processes of scientific experimentation and theory formation.  Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed reseach.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.  The major areas of biomedical application are in rheumatology, where we are collaborating with Drs. D. Lindberg and G. Sharp at the National Library of Medicine and University of Missouri-Columbia, in clinical pathology, where we are working with Dr. Robert Galen of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in ophthalmology, where we have an active collaboration with Dr. C. Dawson at the University of California-San Francisco.  An important aspect of our research is technology transfer, producing prototyes that will be useful to clinical researchers and practitioners.  We have pioneered developments in this field by putting an expert system in a widely used clinical instrument:  a serum protein electrophoresis analyzer.  We are proposing to continue these micro-based innovations for two applications: the interpretation of CPK/LDH isoenzymes for the diagnosis of heart attacks and a primary eye care program for developing countries.  We also propose to continue our research in rule refinement and empirical analysis of expert system knowledge bases.  In addition to the research activities of the Resource, we continue that highly successful dissemination activities of the AIM Workshop series and the Rutgers Resource participation in national AIM collaborative research.

"PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION RESOURCE We propose to develop a protein identification resource.  It will contain an expert computer system for protein identification, which will incorporate and identification paradigm, suitable computer programs, organizational structures (including correlations and patterns in the information) and protein sequences, amino acid compositions, and ancillary biochemical and biological knowledge.  We also propose to develop a system of programs to make predictions of medical significance based mainly on the Resource knowledge, including secondary structure, antigenic sites, recognition domains and cross-reactivity of antibodies, best nucleic acid sequence probes, and possible restriction enzyme cut sites of coding regions.  Finally, we plan to develop a computer system using the knowledge base that will facilitate associative browsing, the development of scientific insight, and the rejection of false hypotheses.  Collaborative research will involve two theoretical projects to quantitate the use of additional data, from amino acid composition and from predicted secondary structures, to improve the power of the identification system.  The other two projects involve the examination of new kinds of experimental data to make identifications.  A workshop on computer methods will be held in the first year to suggest new collaborative projects.  We will continue the on-line public access to our protein sequence knowledge base.  We will publish a Newsletter to familiarize users with the system.  Our goal is to develop a system so easy to use that biochemists all over the worls will perform their own routine identifications using telephone networks.  The great explosion in the accumulation of structural data bears witness that investigators, over 4,000 of them, think that the information is important in their many different fields including virology, immunology, pharmacology, oncology, genetics, genetic engineering, biochemistry, physiology, and pathology.  Protein structures contain important information required for understanding the causes of disease and developing a rational approach to treatment.  These data are essential in the design of cures based on information macromolecules, which can be specific to the individual or to the particular type of virus, cancer, autoimmune disease, on inborn error of metabolism.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation. Throughout the three year period, we will also monitor our progress through iterative testing of reasoning strategies and frequent validations of the program's knowledge.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

In the best case with proteins that have been studied crystallographically, discrepancies of ca. 4 angstroms are observed.  Methods of reducing these errors are evaluated. Second, we seek a detailed model for the motions of ligands in proteins. Conventional molecular dynamics and trajectory calculations will be compared to methods that reveal packing defects and channels in proteins in a direct way.

"BREAST DIAGNOSIS:  QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BY ULTRASOUND The goal of this proposal is to develop and investigate methods and instruments for obtaining reliable quantitative ultrasound images of several acoustic paramenters within two-dimensional coronal cross sections of the breasts of women.  The instrument and associated programs will synergistically combine quantitative multimodal images to obtain diagnoses of breast disease.  Ultrasound computer-assisted transmission tomography will be utilized to obtain quantitative images of acoustic speed, acoustic attenuation, acoustic absorption and scatter and reflection where appropriate.  Both analytic and iterative methods of correcting aberrations in the images caused by inhomogeneous refractive index will be investigated.  Compound B-scan images will also be obtained in the same coronal planes.  Our clinical scanner will be modified to obtain data necessary for high fidelity images derived using newly developed inverse scattering methods.  Patients scheduled for surgical biopsy will be scanned and the resulting images compared to the histology results from biopsy and/or surgical mastectomy.  Comparisons between surgical specimens and acoustic images will be made using methods of automated computer-assisted pattern classification and recognition combined with histological methods of tissue preparation specifically designed to aid in comparing ultrasound images of the coronal plane of the intact breast with similar planes through the excised breast.  This parallel investigation of the clinical instrument, inverse scattering methods, histologic tissue analysis techniques, and pattern recognition programs should result in complete evaluation of the prototype clinical scanner and may result in an instruemnt design capable for use in the clinical environment.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.  The work in the proposed project will build on the extensive previous work in drug monitoring done by these investigators in the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at Stanford and at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.  ,MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS,3442445,R18HS005263,"['physicians ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' hospital patient care ', ' drug adverse effect ', ' chemotherapy ', ' online computer ', ' computer system design /evaluation ', ' health care facility information system ', ' computer assisted medical decision making ', ' ']",AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R18,1986,226763,-0.07316582459234794
"NOVEL PROBES FOR EFFICIENT GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS Current techniques for the diagnosis of genetic disease are limited by an inability to detect the majority of mutations and polymorphisms in DNA. DNA molecules which differ by one or a few base pairs can most efficiently be distinguished currently by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis due to sequence specific differences in melting properties of the DNA. However, base changes can be detected only in domains of the molecule which melt first in these gels.  We propose to improve this technique so that base pair changes can be detected in all domains of a DNA molecule.  We will modify DNA probes in ways that will significantly alter the melting behavior of DNA hybrids, so that new regions of the DNA molecule will be included in the first melting domain.  In addition, we will use experimental data to generate computer models to predict melting behavior of modified DNA molecules.  These computer programs can then be used to design optimal probes for detecting sequence changes in any DNA molecule. This technology should be broad enough for application to any gene of interest, and could lead to the commercial development of diagnostic tests for a number of genetic diseases.

"PERCEIVING STRUCTURE IN EVENTS The aim of this project is to identify the means by which human observers organize moving structures and perceive them as dynamic wholes.  The particular moving structures used will be computer-generated displays of dots that, in their movement, mimic human walkers, rolling wheels, and other everyday events.  Previous research has shown that these displays yield robust percepts, despite their relative impoverishment of seen elements.  And the dearth of elements involved allows simple and concise mathematical description.  This project will proceed on three fronts.  The first will study perceptual organization with a particular focus on how much time is needed to organize a dynamic stimulus.  Brief displays of systems of dots will be displayed for varying amounts of time in order to assess the durations necessary for the identification of familiar movements of near-familiar objects.  The second will study perceptual organization with a focus on the effectiveness of various kinds of camouflage in inhibiting identification of common objects in motion.  Static and dynamic camouflages of several types will be employed, with a particular emphasis on the movement parameters of a dynamic camouflage that are most effective in interfering with identification.  The third will study perception organization with a focus on the information available about movement in iconic memory.  Previous research has shown that such information is available, and the nature of the coded form of that information will be assessed.  The idea is that if information about many parameters of movement is available as early as the icon, then the perceiver is clearly attuned to that information and appears not to need to elaborate it in a computational fashion.  The disciplines involved in this study are, primarily, psychology and visual perception, and, secondarily, artificial intelligence and computer simulation.  The health relatedness of this project is to be measured in terms of understanding the normal function of the human visual/perceptual system, both in situations of natural complexity and in reduced complexity such as when viewing elements on radar screens, and when watching for pedestrians crossing the streets at night.

We intend to study biochemical and 3-dimensional morphologic changes during epithelial cell maturation in the last days of fetal development.  We will test hypotheses of the assembly of lamellar bodies and assess the changes in type II cell maturation induced by glucocorticoids.

"LANGUAGE LEARNABILITY AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT This project has three aims.  The first is development, refinement, and testing of an explicit theory of language acquisition in children.  The theory, building on earlier work, will if successful account for the development of language from the start of syntax learning through the acquisition of complex grammatical structures; it will be consistent with linguistic theory and the important facts of language development in children; it will deal with exotic languages as well as English; and it will learn despite noisy, complex, misinterpreted, or nonstandard inputs. A computer simulation of the theory, using ""constraint satisfaction"" algorithms from artificial intelligence research, will test its adequacy and claims about the kinds of information necessary and sufficient for language acquisition to work.  The second aim is to search computerized databases of children's speech for ""possible but nonoccurring errors"", such as violations of subjacency or dative movement.  These searchers will be used to test claims about what sorts of linguistic constraints children are born with.  The third part of the project is an experimental investigation of certain of children's rule-learning mechanisms and their cognitive correlates.  Children will be taught novel words in isolation to see if they use the semantics of a word to guess its syntactic privileges (e.g. action word = verb; agent = subject).  Interactions between conceptual structure and language development will be examined by studies examining the acquisition of constraints on the causative construction, children's use of a ""thematic"" or spatial schema to conceptualize nonspatial events such as changes of state, and their acquisition of spatial and nonspatial prepositions.  Results of the project could yield new methods of assessing children's ability to produce specific grammatical constructions, insight into the language learning mechanisms that can be used in remediation programs for language-disabled individuals, specific techniques to teach new words and constructions to children, and quantitative measures of language development.

"AUTOMATION OF DNA SEQUENCE DATA ENTRY DNA sequence determination has become a standard method for the characterization of newly isolated genes.  Recent advances in the technology for the determination of DNA sequences have allowed large amounts of data to accumulate rapidly.  However, methods for transferring that data into the computer, where it is to be analysed, are still far from ideal, in that they require considerable manual interention.  We propose to develop a highly automated system that will greatly increase the accuracy and the speed with which sequence data can be collected and analysed.  The method requires first producing a digital image of the sequencing radioautogram.  Algorithms will then be devised that are able to convert that ditigized data into a DNA sequence.  A key feature of the software for this interpretative step is that it will operate according to a set of heuristic procedures that are clearly defined and which can easily be modified and extended.  When these rules fail to provide an unambiguous interpretion then operator assistance will be requested to make a final decision.  An important consequence of the strategy is that the primary data upon which the DNA sequence depends will be available in machine-readable form.  Appropriate software will be developed to manage this primary data and to assist in the resolution of discrepancies that may arise during the course of a sequencing project.  The software tools that will be developed during the course of this project would have additional applications for the interpretation of all kinds of biological data that derive from gel electrophoretic techniques.

"STRUCTURED ANALYSIS OF THE RETINA We propose to develop computer-aided automated analysis of features in ocular fundus images and fluorescein angiograms and further to generate an expert system for rule-based image interpretation and diagnosis.  The use of artificial intelligence in conjunction with image analysis is a sophisticated and innovative approach new to ophthalmology.  Image processing and pattern-recognition techniques will be used to automatically extract features such as hemorrhages, exudates, scars, blood vessels, the optic disk, etc., from digital fundus images by analyzing attributes such as size, shape, color, texture, edge characteristics, fluorescein hyperfluorescence etc., which describe these features.  The automated extraction of fundus features will be performed by a software package called STARE (STructured Analysis of the REtina), which will produce a coded structured description of an image of the ocular fundus.  Features will be assembled into patterns of potential diagnostic significance.  For computer-aided diagnosis, patterns of automatically extracted features will be combined with non-image information provided by the physician expert through application of pre-defined decision rules.  The knowledge and training that enables the physician to appreciate the significance of particular patterns and ask appropriate questions will be encoded in rules designed as IF-THEN-ELSE decision structures.  We will use an existing expert rule-based bystem called ERS (Embedded Rule-based System), which has interactive facilities, to receive information from the physician and report findings.  We will develop STARE for the automated analysis of fundus images through objective measurements of pixels with pixel algorithms such as gradient operators, spectral classifiers, and edge detectors; grouping of pixels with application of pattern-recognition algorithms such as statistical classifiers and segmenters; interpretation of local areas extracted by pixel algorithms using object algorithms for measurement of attributes such as color and edge sharpness; and identification of features such as the disk or exudates with higher level statistical classifiers and rule-based decision making.  Following development of image-coding and database software, we will start with one or two example goal nodes (diagnoses) and will produce rules with both forward chaining and backward chaining, edit and modify the rules with reality testing on our large library of fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms to detect and correct deficiencies in STARE algorithms and ERS rules, and expand the system to cover more diagnoses and improve performance.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms. Specifically, we plan to conduct studies of the following subtopics:  (1) Modelling tectum-pretectum interactions subserving pattern-recognition in anurans; (2) Detailed neural modelling of retina; (3) Modelling patterns of behavior in frog and toad while developing a theory of motor schemas and their coordination for orientation, sidestepping, snapping, etc.; and (4) Developing mathematical and computer methodology for exploring a model-family to determine which subset of models approximates satisfaction of a given set of constraints.  The work will make modelling tools available for the analysis of large brain systems.

"VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM AND FLUID SHEAR STRESS IN VITRO The structural and functional alterations of vascular endothelium caused by fluid shear stress will be investigated in vitro using cultured endothelial cells and a special apparatus we have developed for producing controlled fluid shear stress.  The apparatus utilizes a shallow cone rotating above a flat plate to produce shear stresses between 10 to the -2 and 200 dynes/cm2; both laminar and turbulent flow conditions can be checked. Additional modifications will provide oscillating and alternating shear stress levels to investigate the response of the cells to shear conditions approximating those existing in vivo.  Specific parameters of endothelial structure and function to be measured include:  growth patterns and growth kinetics; migration and mitosis following injury; cell orientation and morphology; rates and mechanisms of endocytosis; cytoskeletal organization; and interaction with extracellular matrix.  This is a collaborative research effort that draws upon the resources, expertise, and experience of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Vascular Pathophysiology Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital.  The research system to be used in this program, comprised of an accurately controlled fluid shear stress apparatus and well defined cultured endothelial specimens, should yield valuable information on the influence of fluid shear stress on the structure and function of vascular endothelium.

"CLONAL KARYOTYPIC EVOLUTION IN HUMAN SOLID TUMORS Detailed cytogenetic banding analysis will be applied to a variety of human cancers to assess directly clonal karyotypic abnormalities.  Sequential chromosome studies will be conducted using a new cytogenetic procedure which samples tumor cells grown in an in vitro bioassay capable of supporting colony formation from a wide variety of human cancers.  Specific time points for sequential analysis will be:  (1)\at diagnosis (prior to therapy); (2)\following cessation of therapy (if measurable residual disease); and (3)\at relapse.  Patients with solid tumors and malignant effusions from breast, ovary, and lung cancer or patients with neuroblastoma will be studied.  The objectives are to assess the clonal karyotypic evolution in primary and metastatic lesions as a response to time and treatment.  Additionally, the karyology of tumor colony-forming cells exposed but resistant to in vitro incubation with various chemotherapeutic agents will be compared to unexposed control cultures. Selective action of these drugs on karyotypic clonal expansion or contraction will be assessed and results compared to measurable in vivo selection at the time of recurrence of disease.  Finally, specific molecular probes for subsegments of chromosomal DNA will be employed to cytogenetically characterize further clonogenic tumor cells.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.  TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM(S) OF EFA PROMOTED GASTRIC MUCOSAL PROTECTION WE PLAN TO STUDY:  (1) THE EFFECT OF DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS AND OF MICROTUBULES AND MICROFILAMENTS DISRUPTIVE AGENTS ON EFA PROTECTION; (2) RESISTANCE OF RESTORED SURFACE EPITHELIUM TO SUBSEQUENT INJURY; (3) ACTION OF EFA ON ISOLATED GASTRIC MUCOSAL CELLS (SURFACE, PROLIFERATIVE ZONE) THEIR VIABILITY AND ABILITY TO GENERATE PROSTAGLANDINS.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We have developed a method to clone synthetic DNAs with regions of random sequence.  We are using this technique to create millions of ribosome binding sites in an isogenic background.  The cloning vehicle contains the lacZ gene positioned to allow quantitation of initiation from each binding site and the f1 origin which allows rapid DNA sequencing.  From a large set of sequences for which we know the relative efficiencies of initiation we can build linear models of the E. coli ribosome binding site.  We will construct plasmids with regions that differ on the 5' and 3' sides from our original plasmid in order to study the more complex effects of mRNA structure and context on translational initiation.  We propose to extend this technique into a tool for the study of any binding site.  We are also studying sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins.  We have adapted the Shannon measure of information to quantitate the information content of several recognition systems.  This has led to a prediction that the T7 late promoters have overlapping repressor sites, a prediction that we are now testing.  We have shown that the information content of sites for recognizer proteins is related to the sequence specific binding energies, and have devised a method to determine the quantitative sequence preferences of proteins through in vitro binding to random DNA.

"CUTANEOUS PATERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the perception of tactile patterns by human subjects.  The tactile patterns will be generated on arrays of stimulators that fit against the subject's fingertips.  Each array consists of 144 stimulators arranged in a matrix 6 columns by 24 rows.  Sets of patterns differing along such dimensions as location, intensity, number of line segments, and so forth will be generated and presented to subjects. Response measures will include identification, discrimination, reaction time, and pattern matching.  Three aspects of tactile pattern perception will be examined:  masking, interactions among multiple sites of stimulation, and the role of experience.  A temporal masking paradigm will be used to see how the perception of tactile patterns is interfered with by tactile maskers and how the nature of the interference changes with changes in the type of masker and in the temporal separation between target and masker.  In the studies of interaction among multiple sites, patterns will be presented to as many as three sites on the fingertips and palm.  This paradigm will be used to assess the role of attention in tactile information processing. The role of short-term experience will be examined by measuring changes in pattern perception as subjects learn to identify and discriminate tactile patterns.  The effect of long-term experience will be evaluated by comparing the performance of groups of subjects who differ in the amount and nature of their experience with complex tactile patterns.  One group will be Optacon users, blind individuals who can read by means of a tactile array.  The other groups will be blind individuals without Optacon experience and several groups of sighted subjects with varying amounts of tactile experience.  The proposed research will be concerned with drawing parallels between tactile processing and visual and auditory processing, with developing measures relevant to understanding the neural coding of tactile patterns, and with improving cutaneous communication systems for the blind, deaf, and deaf-blind.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING This proposal is to develop an integrated program for the representation of complex knowledge and reasoning processes in medicine, using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) and decision analysis (DA).  The project will address problems in both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning in two medical domains: coronary disease, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The planned large-scale AI system will incorporate a common knowledge representation formalism and alternative reasoning programs to do data interpretation, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing and revision, diagnostic query planning, therapeutic planning and automatically-generated explanations.  DA reasoning will be integrated into the system, especially to improve the test and treatment planning components.  A uniform knowledge base will be developed in the two identified medical domains, utilizing knowledge acquired from the analysis of protocols, expert opinion, case-based learning, hand-coded knowledge from the literature, and strictly limited attempts to automatically acquire structured knowledge from English free-text.  A panel of specific cases will be developed that can be used to validate additions to the knowledge base and changes in the reasoning components of the system.  A series of protocol analyses will be done, involving both diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in clinical settings where uncertainty and risk are predominant factors.  Specific attention will focus on the degree to which experienced clinicians rely on case-based reasoning and means will be developed to represent, index and utilize such case-based experience in the reasoning program.  A new generation of DA tools will be built to aid the construction of DA models for use in actual clinical settings.  These tools will utilize the same knowledge bases as the AI models, and will share with them the ability to look in varying depth of detail at problems and to generate explanations of their workings.  A set of template analyses dealing with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, renal transplantation, use of anticoagulant therapy and the timing of surgery for valvular heart disease, and a knowledge base of risk and prognosis estimates in these domains will also be constructed.

"CONTEXT-BASED AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ABNORMAL EEG WAVES The proposed research will investigate the development of an ""intelligent"", multichannel (16 channels) automated (general purpose computer-based) system for the reliable detection of epileptogenic sharp waveforms (spikes and shart waves-STs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  The system will provide the time of occurrence of individual STs, their spatial location, along with values of pertinent electrographic characteristics (e.g. amplitude, duration) thereof.  Special attention will be given to the minimization of false alarms due to artifact and normal EEG activity.  Such a system will especially facilitate the rapid and reliable analysis of long-term EEG recordings from subjects with known or suspected epilepsy, thus contributing to their optimum therapeutic management as well as resulting in savings of time and money.  Extensive heuristics based on human pattern recognition, which involves contextbased analysis, will be utilized.  In this way, the system will incorporate the intelligence of an electroencephalographer (EEGer).  An Artificial Intelligence approach will be implemented, whereby EEG features quantifying candidate waveforms, as well as automated assessment of the subject's state of consciousness will be presented to an Expert System for eventual decision making.  The knowledge base of the Expert system will be developed in close cooperation with an experienced EEGer, so that the extensive contextbased heuristics utilized in the visual analysis process (e.g. spatio-temporal processing involving multichannel correlations) will be implemented.  Special emphasis will be given to programming into the detection system the ability to discriminate against ST-like artifactual activity in the EEG record (e.g. electrocardiographic and electromyographic interference) as well as against sharp but normal EEG activity (e.g. sleep spindles).

"ALGORITHMS FOR ARRHYTHMIA IDENTIFICATION Our general goal is automatic identification of arrhythmias within implantable devices by computer-based signal processing of the intracardiac electrograms.  This goal appears to be realizable because:  1) the arrhythmias to be identified can be provoked in the catheter electrophysiology laboratory and the resulting electrograms can be recorded for detailed analysis; 2) modern signal processing techniques exist for characterizing the electrograms in the time domain and by spectral content; 3) computer algorithms can be designed to recognize these characteristic electrogram features in each arrhythmia; 4) implantable microcomputers are available in which the algorithms can be implemented.  An important premise of this proposal is that the hardware for electrical termination of arrhythmia is already availbale and thus there is a risk of new generations of devices being implanted for arrhythmia control before the underlying electrophysiologic concepts and pattern recognition rules for identifying the arrhythmia are developed and tested.  The signal processing algorithms and decision rules for automatic detection and discrimination will be implemented in real time in a computer program small enough to be part of an implanted anti-tachycardia or defibrillating device.  We will first examine and describe in both the time and frequency domains the characteristic features of electrograms recorded during provocative electrophysiologic study in animals and humans.  Then we will develop computer algorithms for signal processing of the electrograms and for arrhythmia pattern recognition.  Finally, we will test the stated hypotheses by conducting additional animal and human electrophysiology studies and determining the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms. Our approach combines the engineering skill of computer-based signal analysis with the medical skill of diagnostic cardiac electrophysiology. It is our expectation that this approach will provide a sound scientific basis upon which development of specific hardware by pacemaker manufacturers can proceed.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to continue (A) the development of mathematical, statistical and computer methods for the analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences and (B) the application of these methods.  The comparison of two and more informational sequences is central to many problems in molecular biology. (1) Finding consenting patterns that define genetic control regions or that determine structure or function are important examples of sequence comparisons.  An algorithm already developed by my group will be developed further and applied to several new data sets, such as Pol II promoters and RNA splice signals.  Careful data analyses should suggest new modifications to the method.  New and nontrivial insights into promoter patterns, for example, could result from an unbiased, rigorous analysis with calculated significance levels.

"PROTEIN MARKERS OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA The molecular events associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma are essentially unknown and useful biochemical markers for this tumor are not available.  High-resolution protein separation techniques have been used in preliminary experiments to identify a group of proteins which are associated with the tumor, but absent or significantly reduced in normal renal cortex.  This application has as its long-term objective the understanding of the role these proteins play in the expression of the malignant phenotype and the determination of whether serum, urine, or tissue assays for these proteins are of clinical relevance.  The first specific aim of this proposal concerns the production of monoclonal antibodies to these proteins through the immunization of mice with protein spots cut from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, a recently developed technique.  The second aim deals with the use of these antibodies to help isolate and characterize the proteins as to molecular weight, subunit composition, glycosylation, cellular localization, and tissue specificity. These studies will use two-dimensional electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and immunohistochemical staining.  The third specific aim deals with the evaluation of three established renal cell carcinoma-derived cell lines as model systems.  Quantitative computer-aided pattern analysis will be used to compare two-dimensional gels of the cultured cells and tumor tissue, and immunologic methods will also be used to confirm the presence or absence of the carcinoma-associated proteins in the cultured cells.  Specific aim four will be to determine by immunoassay if any of the carcinoma-associated proteins or circulating antibodies to these proteins are present in the serum of patients with this tumor.  If so, preliminary studies will be initiated to determine the potential clinical usefulness for the detection, staging, or typing of renal tumors.  The studies outlined here should provide fundamental information about the biochemistry, cell biology, and clinical chemistry of a group of proteins associated with renal cell carcinoma and provide the necessary tools and information to pursue one or several of these proteins in greater detail in the future.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSES IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN This project is aimed at the development of explicit computational models of perceptual and cognitive processes, relying on mechanism which are consistent with what is known about the physiology and anatomy of the brain.  Recent work simulating perceptual and cognitive processes indicates that this is a fertile path to follow, but to do this adequately I need to learn more about the brain and more about the simulation of the kinds of computational processes which seem consistent with what goes on in the brain.  The first two years of this award would be devoted primarily to obtaining this background, as well as to research applying what I would be learning to a process at the interface between perception and cognition--namely reading.  Before the start of the career development award I plan to obtain some basic background in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and computer simulation techniques used in artificial intelligence.  I plan to spend the first year of the award at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Massachusetts Institue of Technology, studying recent advances in the understanding of parallel computation, and working on the development of a neurally plausible simulation model of the visual aspects of reading.  I plan to spend the second year at the Aphasia Research Center of Boston University at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital, rounding out my background in the neurological basis of cognition and beginning research designed to use the effects of brain damage as a way of finding out about the nature of the underlying processing system. Specifically, I would study the disturbance of word processing ability that arises in deep dyslexia a type of reading disability resulting from damage in certain ageas of the brain.  During the summer of the second year I also plan to participated in an advanced neurophysiology course such as the one offered at Cold Springs Harbor, Long Island.  The remaining three years of the career development award would be dedicated to the continued exploration of simulation models of cognitive and perceptual processes constructed in the light of what I would learn during the first two years; and to the writing of a book designed to help establish the approach of developing neurally plausible simulation models as a central part of the study of perceptual and cognitive processes.
