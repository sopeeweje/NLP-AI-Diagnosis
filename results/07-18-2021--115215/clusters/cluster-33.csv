"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9768545,R01LM012918,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'news', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'side effect', 'social media', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,383874,0.09231618650140971
"Leveraging Unlabeled and Pseudo Data for Clinical Information Extraction Project Summary/Abstract Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain significant information that can benefit many downstream uses. However, most of this information is in unstructured narrative form and is inaccessible to computerized methods that rely on structured representations for exploring, retrieving, and presenting the information. Natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction (IE) open this trove of information to studies that would otherwise be without. Over the past decades, many IE systems have been developed. These systems have typically focused on one task at a time. In addition, most have studied only specific types of records, e.g., discharge summaries, and addressed their task on data from a single institution. Performances achieved by the state-of-the-art IE systems developed under these conditions ranged from 44% F-measure to 99% F-measure. This observed variation can be attributed to the nature of the tasks: some target entities like dates tend to be better represented in the data and also more rigidly stick to known patterns of expression as opposed to reasons for medication administration which are relatively sparse in the data and can show wider linguistic diversity. However, this may not be the only reason: the data used can also explain the performance variation. Narratives of EHRs vary in their style, format, and content going from one department to another, from one hospital to another. Even the same record type in two different hospitals can be very different in narrative style and pose different challenges for IE. Understanding IE performance therefore requires studies of multiple tasks on multiple record types that come from multiple institutions. One major bottleneck for evaluation of IE systems on such a large scale is annotation. The same bottleneck also limits system development. This proposal aims to address this bottleneck for both evaluation and development. It first generates a multi-institution corpus consisting of multiple record types from five institutions. It studies four different IE tasks that broadly represent IE in clinical records and can inform the field of IE as a whole: de-identification, clinical concept extraction, medication extraction, and adverse drug event extraction. Within the context of these IE tasks, the proposal then puts forward methods that learn from unlabeled or pseudo data that can help alleviate reliance on annotated data for development. It evaluates these methods both for performance and generalizability on multiple types of records from multiple institutions. As a result of these activities, this proposal generates de-identified data, annotations, methods, software, and machine learning models which it then makes available to the research community. Project Narrative Information extraction (IE) systems, i.e., natural language processing (NLP) systems that enable creation of accurate semantic representations of narratives, rely heavily on the availability of gold standard annotated corpora and vary significantly in their performance from task to task, and from data set to data set. We propose methods that augment gold standard data with unlabeled data that are more easily available, and pseudo data which can be derived from gold standard data. We study IE within the context of four tasks and evaluate IE systems enhanced with unlabeled and pseudo data for generalizability on a heterogeneous data set consisting of multiple record types from five institutions.",Leveraging Unlabeled and Pseudo Data for Clinical Information Extraction,9813134,R15LM013209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Affect', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Social Work', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Task Performances', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Washington', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'field study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'medication administration', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414798,0.05835320144882698
"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes.

"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9642922,R01LM012973,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,386910,-0.003732528925000444
"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives Project Summary and Abstract Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Natural language processing (NLP) technologies can extract this information and convert it in to a structured format that is more readily accessible by computerized systems. However, the development of NLP systems is contingent on access to relevant data and EHRs are notoriously difficult to obtain because of privacy reasons. Despite the recent efforts to de-identify and release narrative EHRs for research, these data are still very rare. As a result, clinical NLP, as a field has lagged behind. To address this problem, since 2006, we organized thirteen shared tasks, accompanied with workshops and journal publications. Twelve of these shared tasks have focused on the development of clinical NLP systems and the remaining one on the usability of these systems. We have covered both depth and breadth in terms of shared tasks, preparing tasks that study cutting-edge NLP problems on a variety of EHR data from multiple institutions. Our shared tasks are the longest running series of clinical NLP shared tasks, with ever growing EHR data sets, tasks, and participation. Our most popular three data sets have been cited 495 (2010 data), 284 (2006 de-id data), and 274 (2009 data) times, respectively, representing hundreds of articles that have come out of these three data sets alone. Our goal in this proposal is to continue the efforts we started in 2006 under i2b2 shared task challenges (i2b2, NIH NLM U54LM008748, PI: Kohane and R13 LM011411, PI: Uzuner) to de-identify EHRs, annotate them with gold- standard annotations for clinical NLP tasks, and release them to the research community for the development and head-to-head comparison of clinical NLP systems, for the advancement of the state of the art. Continuing our efforts under National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) based at the Health Data Science program of the newly established Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, we aim to form partnerships with the community to grow the shared task efforts in several ways: (1) grow the available de-identified EHR data sets through partnerships that can contribute to the volume and variety of the data, and (2) grow the available gold-standard annotations in terms of depth and breadth of NLP tasks. Given these aims and partnerships, we plan to hold a series of shared tasks. We will complement these shared tasks with workshops that meet in conjunction with the Fall Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association and with journal special issues so that advancement of the state of the art can be sped up and future generations can build on the past. Project Narrative We propose to organize a series of shared tasks, workshops, and journal publications for fostering the continuous development of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that can extract information from narratives of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our aim is to grow the annotated gold standard EHR data sets that are available to the research community through partnerships and to bring together clinical NLP researchers with informatics researchers for building collaborations. We will engage the community in shared tasks and disseminate the knowledge generated by these shared tasks through workshops and journal special issues for the advancement of the state of the art.",National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,9759499,R13LM013127,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Future Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical development', 'computerized', 'falls', 'head-to-head comparison', 'health data', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'practical application', 'programs', 'symposium', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,20000,0.09025049072363889
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases. It is anticipated that the data resources, algorithms, and the Anticoagulant Pharmacovigilance Toolkit (APVTK) developed will significantly enhance ADE detection, patient surveillance and post marketing pharmacovigilance.",EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance,9628032,R01HL125089,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulant therapy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcomes Research', 'Package Insert', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'data resource', 'disorder prevention', 'dosage', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'pharmacovigilance', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,809552,0.0664145813394841
"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients.

"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9652537,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tweens', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2019,76250,0.050613251104890254
"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9665255,R01AI117011,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'molecular sequence database', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,461012,0.06121524224589057
"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9657648,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,636882,0.07258609500897269
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9774751,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2019,600683,0.012949020320583553
"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community. The results of this investigation will also provide contemporary insights on how patients who experience heart attacks in the community are treated by physicians.",Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease,9615037,R01HL135219,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Hospital Administration', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Inpatients', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Reperfusion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Practice Management', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rural', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'hospital readmission', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'prevent', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'surveillance data', 'treatment guidelines', 'trend']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2019,784820,0.06775597166173966
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9445485,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,376490,0.013169684029548896
"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9579181,R01LM012918,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Area', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'natural language', 'new technology', 'news', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'social media', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,416066,0.09231618650140971
"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes.

"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts.

Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9534183,R01LM011934,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information model', 'novel', 'open source', 'profiles in patients', 'public health relevance', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,387966,0.09718253772898433
"Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance PROJECT SUMMARY The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Quality Payment Program is designed to motivate healthcare providers to adhere to best practices in clinical healthcare and patient safety. Unfortunately, extracting quality measures data from the clinical record is burdensome and as such, participation among clinical healthcare providers is suboptimal. Our aim is to develop a system to facilitate automatic extraction of quality data. This will reduce the burden of data collection and help remove the barrier to participation that keeps more providers from participating in the program. The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. We envision this to be an effective research partnership that leverages the complementary assets of SaferMD, a small business unit, and the University of Michigan, a non-profit research institution, to develop and evaluate a prototype tool to extract clinical quality measures data, and increase participation in the Quality Payment Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. The project will develop algorithms to identify fields relevant for quality measures and develop tools to extract and analyze these data elements from large sets of radiology reports. Finally, the proposed work will initiate the extracted measures into existing quality service offerings by SaferMD.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9479293,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient portal', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2018,248999,0.047197010591600946
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9481256,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,227899,0.05392686531556505
"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients. We will advance state-of-the-art NLP by designing robust, scalable methods that leverage health big data, demonstrating relevance on high-impact use cases, and disseminating NLP tools for the research community and public at large.",Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP,9421556,R01GM114355,"['Apache', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Information Resources', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Marshal', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'information organization', 'method development', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'social media', 'software development', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,793522,0.10391753519190253
"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9454246,R01AI117011,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'molecular sequence database', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2018,461012,0.06121524224589057
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9534182,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient-clinician communication', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,335217,0.05462788961650579
"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9486584,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,484387,0.07258609500897269
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9476980,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,300000,0.0899091783258022
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR).

Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research.

"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9566983,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,187483,0.0324593944257875
"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community. The results of this investigation will also provide contemporary insights on how patients who experience heart attacks in the community are treated by physicians.",Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease,9395941,R01HL135219,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Hospital Administration', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Inpatients', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Reperfusion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Practice Management', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rural', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'hospital readmission', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'prevent', 'socioeconomics', 'surveillance data', 'treatment guidelines', 'trend']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2018,803425,0.06775597166173966
"Enabling large-scale research on autism spectrum disorders through automated processing of EHR using natural language understanding Project Summary/Abstract  With increasing use of electronic medical records for a variety of patients, a large investment is being made in a resource still vastly underused. Especially in mental health, where problems are highly individualized, requiring personalized intervention, and often accompanied by rich data not easily captured in structured templates, the need for extracting information from free text in existing records for use as large-scale stand- alone datasets or in combination with other data is real. Without scalable and effective computational approaches to capture this data, much time, effort and money is used to create limited-use records that instead could be leveraged into precious data sources to inform existing research and lead to new insights, progress and treatments. Our broad, long-term goal is processing free text in EHR in mental health. We focus on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), a particularly interesting example of both shortcomings and opportunities.  ASD’s prevalence has increased over the years, and estimates range from 1 in 150 in 2000 to 1 in 68 in 2010(1-5). These numbers are based on surveillance using electronic health records. The increasing prevalence is not well understood, and hypotheses range from changing diagnostic criteria to environmental factors. The lines of inquiry used to find cures are similarly broad and range from brain scans and genetics, resulting in large structured datasets, to highly individualized therapies, resulting in rich but unstructured data. Currently the text information in the electronic records is not being leveraged on a large scale.  The proposed project continues our preliminary work and uses a data-driven approach to create human- interpretable models that allow automated extraction of relevant structured data from free text. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the starting point for identifying features. A database of thousands of records is leveraged to design and test the algorithms. The two specific aims are: 1) design and test natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to detect DSM criteria for ASD in free text in EHR, and 2) demonstrate feasibility and usefulness of the models for large-scale analysis of ASD cases, which is inconceivable today with current approaches. Our methods include analysis of free text in electronic records and end-user annotations to create a large gold standard of instances of DSM criteria for ASD, application of machine learning and rule-based approaches to create human-interpretable models for automated annotation of diagnostic patterns in textual records, and demonstrate usefulness with new research (e.g., Automatically detect ASD vs. no-ASD status for challenging cases; evaluate prevalence of symptoms over time). Through NLP algorithms, this project has the potential to significantly shift away from the current paradigm of attempting to understand ASD by relying on small-scale data from individual interventions and lack of integration between different data sources, to leveraging information from existing large-scale data sources to propose novel analyses and hypotheses. Project Narrative  Lack of sophisticated tools to extract relevant diagnostic patterns from free text from the increasingly large number of electronic medical/health records is a critical barrier in the field of mental health to leverage and utilize the already available data. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms designed specifically for mental health can make new data analysis and integration with other sources possible at a scale previously unseen. Using a data-driven process, this project will design NLP algorithms to annotate free text with criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and demonstrate scope, feasibility and usefulness by focusing on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) where prevalence is increasing and much rich clinical text is stored in electronic health records (EHR).",Enabling large-scale research on autism spectrum disorders through automated processing of EHR using natural language understanding,9547263,R21HS024988,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2018,146202,-0.03391990581011048

"Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports Title: Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports Project Summary/Abstract Population level studies have shown that the device-based hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with increased risks of reoperation during follow-up, when compared to traditional laparoscopic sterilization. However, secondary data sources often lack the granularity to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to the device removal and additional surgery. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database houses medical device reports submitted to the FDA by mandatory and voluntary reporters. These reports contain detailed information of patient and device adverse events. But due to its narrative structure, research with the reports has been limited, partially due to the restrictions of keyword search and manual review. The proposed study will innovatively apply natural language processing (NLP) to analyze MAUDE reports of device removals. NLP is a powerful tool capable of extracting information efficiently from documents such as medical notes, allowing the summarization of thousands of adverse event reports in a cost-effective way. The primary aim is to develop an NLP program to extract and summarize patient- and device-specific complications associated with device removal and additional surgeries following hysteroscopic sterilization. Secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting behavior and structure. The hypotheses are that the majority of reported removals were associated with device-related complications as opposed to persistent symptoms only, and that after the FDA convened a panel discussion in September 2015, adverse event reports were more likely to be submitted by mandatory reporters, with improvement in structured presentation. Adverse event reports related to device removal will be selected from the MAUDE database using keyword search first, and 1,000 reports will be annotated and used to develop and validate the NLP tool. Applying the developed NLP to all reports, extracted information will be used for the analysis, and comparisons will be made before and after September 2015. The significance of the proposed research is that it will develop a method to better utilize adverse event reports to obtain crucial device safety information supplemental to regular population-level studies. By achieving this, the long term goal is to create a useful tool for future medical device safety surveillance to understand the nature of adverse events. The immediate next step will be to use the tool to investigate device safety in other areas. The comprehension of the nature of device adverse events and the elucidation of the crucial role of regulatory activity in facilitating reliable adverse event reporting will help promote patient safety evaluation and monitoring. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on device adverse event reports and develop a powerful tool to analyze reports to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to device removals and additional surgeries. The study will also elucidate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of AHRQ's mission to make health care safer.",Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports,9586941,R03HS026291,[' '],AHRQ,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R03,2018,96907,0.025984727260659143
"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors.

"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes.

"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research. Project Narratives The proposed project aims to broaden the secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs) across the research community by combining innovative privacy-preserving computing techniques and clinical natural language processing.",Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory,9385056,U01TR002062,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biological Preservation', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Hepatolenticular Degeneration', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Distribution', 'Institution', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cohort', 'collaboratory', 'data registry', 'empowered', 'health data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'phrases', 'portability', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual']",NCATS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2017,1589604,0.14027779224336667
"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,9325065,R01LM011934,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information model', 'novel', 'open source', 'profiles in patients', 'public health relevance', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,387966,0.09718253772898433
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9254613,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2017,248999,0.047197010591600946
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9275946,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,227900,0.05392686531556505
"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients. We will advance state-of-the-art NLP by designing robust, scalable methods that leverage health big data, demonstrating relevance on high-impact use cases, and disseminating NLP tools for the research community and public at large.",Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP,9199581,R01GM114355,"['Apache', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Information Resources', 'Injectable', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Marshal', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'information organization', 'method development', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'social media', 'software development', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,798827,0.10391753519190253
"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9249484,R01AI117011,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'molecular sequence database', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2017,461012,0.06121524224589057
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9332464,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,335217,0.05462788961650579
"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9355161,R21HS024977,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2017,159334,0.0605547932739216
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9453180,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,189054,0.0324593944257875
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9251814,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,300000,0.0899091783258022
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project ""Temporal relation discovery for clinical text"" (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.             Specific Aim 1: Extract enhanced representations and novel features to support deriving timeline information.     Specific Aim 2: Develop methods to amalgamate individual patient episode timelines into an aggregate patient-level timeline.     Specific Aim 3: Mine the EHR - the unstructured clinical text and the structured codified information - for full patient-level temporality.     Specific Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive temporal visualization tool     Specific Aim 5: Develop methodology for and perform extrinsic evaluation on specific use case.     Specific Aim 6: (1) Evaluate state-of-the-art of temporal relations through organizing international challenges under the auspices of SemEval, (2) Disseminate the results through publications, presentations, and open source code in Apache cTAKES.

"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community. The results of this investigation will also provide contemporary insights on how patients who experience heart attacks in the community are treated by physicians.",Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease,9215012,R01HL135219,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Hospital Administration', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Inpatients', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Reperfusion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Practice Management', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rural', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'hospital readmission', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'prevent', 'socioeconomics', 'surveillance data', 'trend']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2017,836858,0.06775597166173966
"Enabling large-scale research on autism spectrum disorders through automated processing of EHR using natural language understanding Project Summary/Abstract  With increasing use of electronic medical records for a variety of patients, a large investment is being made in a resource still vastly underused. Especially in mental health, where problems are highly individualized, requiring personalized intervention, and often accompanied by rich data not easily captured in structured templates, the need for extracting information from free text in existing records for use as large-scale stand- alone datasets or in combination with other data is real. Without scalable and effective computational approaches to capture this data, much time, effort and money is used to create limited-use records that instead could be leveraged into precious data sources to inform existing research and lead to new insights, progress and treatments. Our broad, long-term goal is processing free text in EHR in mental health. We focus on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), a particularly interesting example of both shortcomings and opportunities.  ASD’s prevalence has increased over the years, and estimates range from 1 in 150 in 2000 to 1 in 68 in 2010(1-5). These numbers are based on surveillance using electronic health records. The increasing prevalence is not well understood, and hypotheses range from changing diagnostic criteria to environmental factors. The lines of inquiry used to find cures are similarly broad and range from brain scans and genetics, resulting in large structured datasets, to highly individualized therapies, resulting in rich but unstructured data. Currently the text information in the electronic records is not being leveraged on a large scale.  The proposed project continues our preliminary work and uses a data-driven approach to create human- interpretable models that allow automated extraction of relevant structured data from free text. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the starting point for identifying features. A database of thousands of records is leveraged to design and test the algorithms. The two specific aims are: 1) design and test natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to detect DSM criteria for ASD in free text in EHR, and 2) demonstrate feasibility and usefulness of the models for large-scale analysis of ASD cases, which is inconceivable today with current approaches. Our methods include analysis of free text in electronic records and end-user annotations to create a large gold standard of instances of DSM criteria for ASD, application of machine learning and rule-based approaches to create human-interpretable models for automated annotation of diagnostic patterns in textual records, and demonstrate usefulness with new research (e.g., Automatically detect ASD vs. no-ASD status for challenging cases; evaluate prevalence of symptoms over time). Through NLP algorithms, this project has the potential to significantly shift away from the current paradigm of attempting to understand ASD by relying on small-scale data from individual interventions and lack of integration between different data sources, to leveraging information from existing large-scale data sources to propose novel analyses and hypotheses. Project Narrative  Lack of sophisticated tools to extract relevant diagnostic patterns from free text from the increasingly large number of electronic medical/health records is a critical barrier in the field of mental health to leverage and utilize the already available data. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms designed specifically for mental health can make new data analysis and integration with other sources possible at a scale previously unseen. Using a data-driven process, this project will design NLP algorithms to annotate free text with criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and demonstrate scope, feasibility and usefulness by focusing on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) where prevalence is increasing and much rich clinical text is stored in electronic health records (EHR).",Enabling large-scale research on autism spectrum disorders through automated processing of EHR using natural language understanding,9381416,R21HS024988,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2017,146202,-0.03391990581011048

"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.  We believe this application aligns with AHRQ's HIT and Patient Safety portfolios as well as AHRQ's Special Emphasis Notice to support projects to generate new evidence on health IT system safety (NOT- HS-15-005).

The goal of this study is two-fold: 1) to study the nature of such errors and how they may affect the quality of care and 2) to develop innovative methods based on computerized natural language processing to automatically detect these errors in clinical documents so that physicians can correct the documents before entering them into the patient's medical record.",NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents,9352296,R01HS024264,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,249995,0.046696586982903056
"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9342692,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2017,148922,0.04768799158796611
"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies. Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date.

"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers.

"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors. This technology will allow more accurate data extraction from clinical documents, thus to facilitate clinical research that rely on EHRs data.",Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing,9132834,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computerized', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,463405,0.07986713318996676
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.            ",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9105846,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,413500,0.013169684029548896
"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts.

"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process. All deliverables will be distributed through the open health NLP (OHNLP) consortium which we intend to make it more open and inclusive. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9228509,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'database structure', 'design', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2016,249000,0.047197010591600946
"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,9115065,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,227891,0.05392686531556505
"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP PROJECT SUMMARY There is a deluge of health-related texts in many genres, from the clinical narrative to newswire and social media. These texts are diverse in content, format, and style, and yet they represent complementary facets of biomedical and health knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to extract, understand, and distill valuable information from these overwhelming large and complex streams of data, with the ultimate goal to advance biomedicine and impact the health and wellbeing of patients. There have been a number of success stories in various biomedical NLP applications, but the NLP methods investigated are usually tailored to one specific phenotype and one institution, thus reducing portability and scalability. Moreover, while there has been much work in the processing of clinical texts, other genres of health texts, like narratives and posts authored by health consumers and patients, are lacking solutions to marshal and make sense of the health information they contain. Robust NLP solutions that answer the needs of biomedicine and health in general have not been fully investigated yet. A unified, data-science approach to health NLP enables the exploration of methods and solutions unprecedented up to now.  Our vision is to unravel the information buried in the health narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of texts. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP (hNLP) made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. Our proposal moves the field into exploring semi-supervised and fully unsupervised methods, which only succeed when very large amounts of data are leveraged and knowledge is injected into the methods with care. Our hNLP proposal also targets a key challenge of current hNLP research: the lack of shared software. We seek to provide a clearinghouse for software created under this proposal, and as such all developed tools will be disseminated. Starting from the data characteristics of health texts and information needs of stakeholders, we will develop and evaluate methods for information extraction, information understanding. We will translate our research into the publicly available NLP software platform cTAKES, through robust modules for extraction and understanding across all genres of health texts. We will also demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine, to participatory medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities, such as challenges to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There is a deluge of health texts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) holds much promise to unravel valuable information from these large data streams with the goal to advance medicine and the wellbeing of patients.

"Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and evaluate an infrastructure that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify more precise geographic information for modeling spread of zoonotic viruses. These new models could enable public health agencies to identify the most at-risk areas. In addition, by improving geospatial information in popular sequence databases such as GenBank, we will enrich other sciences that utilize this information such as molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and environmental health.                ",Tracking Evolution and Spread of Viral Genomes by Geospatial Observation Error,9065021,R01AI117011,"['Accounting', 'Animals', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'China', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hantavirus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nucleotides', 'Population Genetics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'RNA Viruses', 'Rabies', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Source', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'System', 'Taxon', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Work', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'journal article', 'pathogen', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2016,479735,0.06121524224589057
"Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States. Project Narrative Epilepsy affects more than 479,000 children; 30% of those are not controlled with medication and may require surgery. We developed a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that can be integrated into neurology practice to detect patients who may be eligible for epilepsy surgical consults. Once implemented, this research can help to drive successful implementations of NLP and identify and use ideal alerting mechanisms in neurological care.",Optimal Methods for Notifying Clinicians about Epilepsy Surgery Patients,9222109,R21HS024977,[' '],AHRQ,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2016,137233,0.0605547932739216
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9115724,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,335217,0.05462788961650579
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9050675,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,300000,0.0899091783258022
"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format, with tremendous potentials, but also equally growing concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potentials for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of the research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary uses of clinical data, and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious ad costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically de-identify clinical notes found in the EHR, to then improve the availability of clinical text for secondary uses, as well as ameliorate the protection of patient data confidentiality. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the text de-identification application, a reference standard that will include a random sample of clinical narratives with protected health information annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically de-identify clinical text in near real-time, a prototype that will implement a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first (our priority for de-identification), and then filter out false positives to enhance positive predictive value, and also replace PHI with realistic substitutes for improved protection; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing, and also train and test the prototype with a reference standard from another healthcare organization. Commercial application: To strengthen patient information confidentiality protection, the HITECH Act heightened financial penalties incurred for breaches of PHI, even introducing criminal penalties. These new severe consequences for violation of patient information confidentiality render protection requirements even more obvious, and automatic high-accuracy clinical text de-identification, as offered by the system Clinacuity proposes, will strongly help healthcare and clinical research organizations avoid such consequences. This system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will also ease research data sharing, and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality.

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project ""Temporal relation discovery for clinical text"" (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.             Specific Aim 1: Extract enhanced representations and novel features to support deriving timeline information.     Specific Aim 2: Develop methods to amalgamate individual patient episode timelines into an aggregate patient-level timeline.     Specific Aim 3: Mine the EHR - the unstructured clinical text and the structured codified information - for full patient-level temporality.     Specific Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive temporal visualization tool     Specific Aim 5: Develop methodology for and perform extrinsic evaluation on specific use case.     Specific Aim 6: (1) Evaluate state-of-the-art of temporal relations through organizing international challenges under the auspices of SemEval, (2) Disseminate the results through publications, presentations, and open source code in Apache cTAKES.

"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The electronic tools developed will be portable to different institutions and other health conditions. The PI will be uniquely positioned as a cardiologist within a large academic health system working with novel NLP techniques at the interface of the EHR and CDS to rapidly translate knowledge acquired in community-based epidemiologic investigations to patient care.] The PI has proposed a research career development plan to acquire expertise in translational informatics including electronic phenotyping, and automated calculation and visual display of prognostic scores using a novel application integrated with clinical decision support (CDS). The PI will complete comprehensive coursework in informatics science and gain additional patient-oriented and epidemiologic research experience. The primary mentor will be Iftikhar Kullo, M.D., cardiologist and PI of the Mayo Clinic electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network and a leader in the development and application of electronic phenotyping for genomic studies of PAD. The mentoring team also includes Dr. Christopher Chute, M.D., Head of Medical Informatics at Mayo Clinic, an expert in informatics and epidemiology, and co-PI of the Mayo eMERGE grant and co-investigator of the Rochester Epidemiology Project; Hongfang Liu, Ph.D., an expert in natural language processing (NLP) and its application for EHR-based phenotyping; and Kent Bailey, Ph.D., senior biostatistician with expertise in development of prognostic risk scores. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1 - Apply phenotyping algorithms that include NLP of clinical notes to [a] identify PAD cases and controls without PAD in the community from 1998-2011; and [b] ascertain adverse cardiovascular and limb outcomes through December 2013. Aim 2 - Create multivariable prognostic risk models and scores for adverse outcomes in PAD cases from the community. We will estimate the relative risk of death in PAD patients compared to controls without PAD. Aim 3 - Develop and evaluate usefulness of a novel electronic application within the Mayo EHR to retrieve relevant data elements, calculate, and display individualized prognostic scores. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and an e-health prognostication tool for PAD patients to be disseminated to stakeholders including clinicians, patients, and researchers portable to other institutions and other cardiovascular diseases.

"Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Managing allergy information within the electronic health record (EHR) is vital to ensuring patient safety. The goal of this study is to propose a comprehensive solution to assess existing terminology standards and knowledge bases for representing allergy information, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) system for extracting and encoding allergy information from free-text clinical documents, and finally measure the feasibility of using NLP output to facilitate the allergy reconciliation proces.",Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs,9142280,R01HS022728,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,491053,0.12300291981643537
"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.

"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9245525,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2016,148922,0.04768799158796611
"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented.

Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies.

"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers.

"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3. Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors.

"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,8928647,R01LM011934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'query optimization', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,376327,0.09718253772898433
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,8978947,K99LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2015,83160,0.05375179002792179
"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process. All deliverables will be distributed through the open health NLP (OHNLP) consortium which we intend to make it more open and inclusive. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research.

"Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that optimal treatment is not the same for every patient - it depends on the individual patient's circumstances. One important factor that determines the optimal clinical management is the patient's life expectancy, which determines the temporal horizon within which medical decisions have to operate. For example, while adding an extra diabetes medication may save a 40-year-old individual from going blind or developing kidney failure 20 years later, it will not bring any benefits to an 80-yer old with a metastatic malignancy who is expected to live only a few months.  Consequently, it is critical that when we measure quality of care, suggest treatment options to clinicians through clinical decision support or compare different treatment strategies, we take into account the patient's life expectancy. However, currently there are no methods available that can do this with sufficient accuracy.  Most commonly used techniques to assess a patient's mortality risk draw primarily on administrative data and other structured data fields in electronic medical records. This approach leaves out a large amount of information that is only available in narrative documents such as provider notes, radiology reports, etc. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that application of two novel technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing (NLP) - could leverage the information in narrative electronic documents to significantly improve the accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.  Dynamic Logic allows to circumvent the challenge of combinatorial complexity that limits the number of variables and their combinations that can be considered as predictors of an outcome by most currently used analytical methods. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly increase the richness of the models for identification of patients with low life expectancy and ultimately improve their accuracy.  Information such as the patient's functional status that is usually only found in narrative documents may be critical to improving accuracy of identifying frail patients at high mortality risk. Modern NLP techniques can effectively identify key concepts in medical text but until now analytical methods allowed consideration of only a few of pre-selected concepts in prediction models. Combining NLP with Dynamic Logic will allow us to greatly expand the number of concepts from narrative text that could be included in the life expectancy prediction model, likely leading to a considerable improvement in accuracy.  In the proposed translational multidisciplinary project our team that will include experts on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, analysis of data in electronic medical records, and geriatrics will test whether a combination of Dynamic Logic and NLP improves identification of patients at high risk of death.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identification of patients with limited life expectancy is important for accurate measurement of quality of care delivered by clinicians, clinical decision support in electronic medical records and research that compares different treatment options for patients. However, currently available methods suffer from low accuracy or use information that is not widely available. In this project we propose to combine two advanced computational technologies - artificial intelligence technique Dynamic Logic and natural language processing - to improve accuracy of identification of patients with low life expectancy.            ",Identification of Patients with Low Life Expectancy,8942806,R01HS024090,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,232521,0.05392686531556505
"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8804856,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,0.06423861723428077
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8875053,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,531035,0.03255376673911745
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8911361,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,325159,0.05462788961650579
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project ""Temporal relation discovery for clinical text"" (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR).

"Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Managing allergy information within the electronic health record (EHR) is vital to ensuring patient safety. The goal of this study is to propose a comprehensive solution to assess existing terminology standards and knowledge bases for representing allergy information, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) system for extracting and encoding allergy information from free-text clinical documents, and finally measure the feasibility of using NLP output to facilitate the allergy reconciliation proces.",Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs,8920540,R01HS022728,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,488893,0.12300291981643537
"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.

"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8934087,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,145229,0.041236849682706155
"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers.

"Interactive machine learning methods for clinical natural language processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3.             Project Narrative In this project, we propose to develop interactive machine learning methods to process clinical text stored in electronic health records (EHRs) systems. Such methods can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost, thus improving performance of text processors.

"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8722030,R01LM011366,"['Address', 'Age', 'Applied Research', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Disclosure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Son', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'efficacy testing', 'male', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,260727,0.04425902532320632
"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.          This proposal aims to organize a series of workshops, conference proceedings, and journal special issues that will accompany the shared-task challenges in order to disseminate the knowledge generated by the challenges.                 Public health relevance: this proposal will address two main challenges related to the use of clinical narratives for research: availability of clinical records for research and identification of the state of the art in clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies so that we can push the state of the art forward and so that future work can build on the past.

"Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have shown promise for extracting data from the free text of electronic health records (EHRs), but studies have consistently found that techniques do not readily generalize across application settings. Unfortunately, most of the focus in applying NLP to real use cases has remained on a paradigm of single, well-defined application settings, so that generalizability to unseen use cases remains implicitly unaddressed. We propose to explicitly account for unseen application settings by adopting an information retrieval (IR) perspective with the objective of patient-level cohort identification. To do so, we introduce layered language models, an IR framework that enables the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts. Our long term goal is to accelerate investigations of patient health and disease by providing robust, user- centric tools that are necessary to process, retrieve, and utilize the free text of EHRs. The main goal of this proposal is to accurately retrieve ad hoc, realistic cohorts from clinical text at Mayo Clinic and OHSU, establishing methods, resources, and evaluation for patient-level IR. We hypothesize that cohort identification can be addressed in a generalizable fashion by a new IR framework: layered language models. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will make medical NLP artifacts searchable in our layered language IR framework. This involves storing and indexing the NLP artifacts, as well as using statistical language models to retrieve documents based on text and its associated NLP artifacts. In Aim 2, we deal with the practical setting of ad hoc cohort identification, moving to patient-level (rather than document-level) IR. To accurately handle patient cohorts in which qualifying evidence may be spread over multiple documents, we will develop and implement patient-level retrieval models that account for cross- document relational and temporal combinations of events. In Aim 3, we will construct parallel IR test collections using EHR data from two sites; a diverse set of cohort queries written by multiple people toward various clinical or epidemiological ends; and assessments of which patients are relevant to which queries at both sites. Finally, in Aim 4, we refine and evaluate patient-level layered language IR on the ad hoc cohort identification task, making comparisons across the users, queries, optimization metrics, and institutions. We will draw additional extrinsic comparisons with pre-existing techniques, e.g., for cohorts from the Electronic Medical Records and Genonmics network. The expected outcomes of the proposed work are: (i) An open-source cohort identification tool, usable by clinicians and epidemiologists, that makes principled use of NLP artifacts for unseen queries; ii) A parallel test collection for cohort identification, includig two intra-institutional document collections, diverse test topics and user-produced text queries, and patient-level judgments of relevance to each query; and (iii) Validation of the reusability of medical NLP via the task of retrieving patient cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, one might expect that it would be simple for a medical expert to find things like ""patients in the community who suffer from asthma."" Unfortunately, on top of lab tests, medications, and demographic information, there are observations that a physician writes down as text - which are difficult for a computer to understand. Therefore, we aim to process text so that a computer can understand enough of it, and then search that text along with the rest of a patient's medical record; this will allow clinicians or researchers to find and study patients groups of interest.                ",Semi-structured Information Retrieval in Clinical Text for Cohort Identification,8811565,R01LM011934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Institution', 'Interest Group', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Writing', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'cohort', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2014,460688,0.09718253772898433
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications  PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develop a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process.

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A critical element of translating science into practice is the ability to find patient populations for clinical research. Many studies rely on administrative data for selecting relevant patients for studies of comparative effectiveness, but the limitations of administrative data is well-known. Much of the information critical for clinical research is locked in free-text dictated reports, such as history and physical exams and radiology reports. Data repositories, such as the Medical Archival Retrieval System (MARS) at the University of Pittsburgh, are useful for identifying supersets of patients for clinical research studies through indexed word searches. However, simple text-based queries are also limited in their effectiveness, and researchers are often left reading through hundreds or thousands of reports to filter out false positive cases. Current processes are time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive. They lead to long delays between the development of a testable hypothesis and the ability to share findings with the medical community at large.       A potential solution to this problem is pre-annotating de-identified clinical reports to facilitate more intelligent and sophisticated retrieval and review. Clinical reports are rich in meaning and structure and can be annotated at many different levels using natural language processing technology. It is not clear, however, what types of annotations would be most helpful to a clinical researcher, nor is it clear how to display the annotations to best assist manual review of reports. There is interdependence between the annotation schema used by an NLP system and the user interface for assisting researchers in retrieving data for retrospective studies. In this proposal, we will interactively revise an NLP annotation schema as well as explore various methods for annotation display based on feedback from users reviewing patient data for specific research studies.       We hypothesize that an interactive search application that relies on NLP-annotated clinical text will increase the accuracy and efficiency of finding patients for clinical research studies and will support visualization techniques for viewing the data in a way that improves a researcher's ability to review patient data.              Narrative We will develop a novel review application for this proposal that will facilitate translational research from secondary use of EHR data by assisting researchers in more efficiently finding retrospective populations of patients for clinical research studies. The application will rely both on multi-layered annotation of the textual data, using natural langauge processing, and on coordinated views of the patient data.",Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann,8714052,R01LM010964,"['Automated Annotation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Imagery', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer human interaction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'research study', 'success']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2014,579144,0.0731563136436081
"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result.

"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8708209,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,535841,0.03255376673911745
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported.                 Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8760594,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,398307,0.05462788961650579
"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.

"Encoding and Processing Patient Allergy Information in EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Managing allergy information within the electronic health record (EHR) is vital to ensuring patient safety. The goal of this study is to propose a comprehensive solution to assess existing terminology standards and knowledge bases for representing allergy information, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) system for extracting and encoding allergy information from free-text clinical documents, and finally measure the feasibility of using NLP output to facilitate the allergy reconciliation proces.

"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Cancer Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically extract medical problems and allergies, implementing a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first, and also enhance positive predictive value; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incentive payments.

"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.            ",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8678798,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2014,145229,0.041236849682706155
"Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for observational research. More recently, huge efforts have linked EMR databases with archived biological material, to accelerate research in personalized medicine. EMR- linked DNA biobanks have identified common and rare genetic variants that contribute to risk of disease. An appealing vision, which has not been extensively explored, is to use EMRs-linked biobanks for pharmacogenomic studies, which identify associations between genetic variation and drug efficacy and toxicity. The longitudinal nature of the data contained within EMRs make them ideal for quantifying drug outcome (both efficacy and toxicity). Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large-scale studies of treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. Despite its success, EMR-based pharmacogenomic studies are often hampered by its data-intensive nature -- it is time- consuming and costly to extract and integrate data from multiple heterogeneous EMR databases, for large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners Healthcare System. I2b2 has developed a scalable informatics framework to enable clinical researchers to repurpose existing EMR data for clinical and genomic discovery. In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by proposing the following specific aims: 1) Develop new methods to extract and model drug exposure and outcome information from EMR and integrate them with the i2b2 NLP components; 2) Build ontology tools to normalize and integrate pharmacogenomic data across different sites; 3) Conduct known and novel pharmacogenomic studies to evaluate and refine tools developed in Aim 1 and 2; and 4) Disseminate the developed informatics tools among pharmacogenomic researchers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) linked with DNA biobanks have become valuable resources for genomic and pharmacogenomics research, allowing identification of associations between genetic variations and drug efficacy and toxicity.

In this study, we will collaborate with i2b2 to extend its informatics framework to the pharmacogenomics domain, by developing new natural language processing, ontology components, and user-friendly interfaces, and then apply these tools to real-world pharmacogenomic studies.            ",Informatics Tools for Pharmacogenomic Discovery using Practice-based Data,8629996,R01GM103859,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anthracyclines', 'Archives', 'Award', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug toxicity', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heparin', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'Institution', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vancomycin', 'Vision', 'Warfarin', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clopidogrel', 'data integration', 'disorder risk', 'drug efficacy', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'large-scale database', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'rare variant', 'response', 'success', 'surveillance study', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIGMS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,648591,0.031313704022783904
"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8532984,R01LM011366,"['Address', 'Age', 'Applied Research', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Disclosure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Son', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'efficacy testing', 'male', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,247288,0.04425902532320632
"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.          This proposal aims to organize a series of workshops, conference proceedings, and journal special issues that will accompany the shared-task challenges in order to disseminate the knowledge generated by the challenges.                  Public health relevance: this proposal will address two main challenges related to the use of clinical narratives for research: availability of clinical records for research and identification of the state of the art in clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies so that we can push the state of the art forward and so that future work can build on the past. Progress in clinical NLP will improve access to electronic health records for research, and for clinical applications, benefiting healthcare and public health.",Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,8538500,R13LM011411,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Distributed Systems', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Series', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Work', 'clinical application', 'data sharing', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'indexing', 'practical application', 'public health relevance', 'symposium']",NLM,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,R13,2013,18400,0.09291257882967667
"Natural language processing for clinical and translational research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research. This growth is being fueled by recent federal legislation that provides generous financial incentives to institutions demonstrating aggressive application and ""meaningful use"" of comprehensive EMRs. Efforts are already underway to link these EMRs across institutions, and standardize the definition of phenotypes for large scale studies of disease onset and treatment outcome, specifically within the context of routine clinical care. However, a well-known challenge for secondary use of EMR data for clinical and translational research is that much of detailed patient information is embedded in narrative text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which are able to convert unstructured clinical text into coded data, have been introduced into the biomedical domain and have demonstrated promising results. Researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents. Different NLP systems have been developed at different institutions and utilized to convert clinical narrative text into structured data that may be used for other clinical applications and studies. Successful stories in applying NLP to clinical and translational research have been reported widely. However, institutions often deploy different NLP systems, which produce various types of output formats and make it difficult to exchange information between sites. Therefore, the lack of interoperability among different clinical NLP systems becomes a bottleneck for efficient multi-site studies. In addition, many successful studies often require a strong interdisciplinary team where informaticians and clinicians have to work very closely to iteratively define optimal algorithms for clinical phenotypes. As intensive informatics support may not be available to every clinical researcher, the usability of NLP systems for end users is another important issue. The proposed project builds upon first-hand knowledge and experience across the research team in the use of NLP for clinical and translational research projects. There are several big informatics initiatives for clinical and translational research but those initiatives generally assume one shoe fits all and follow top-down approaches to develop NLP solutions. Complementary to those initiatives, we will use a bottom-up approach to handle interoperability and usability: i) we will obtain a common NLP data model and exchange format through empirical analysis of existing NLP systems and NLP results; ii) we will develop a user-centric NLP front end interface for NLP systems wrapped to be consistent with the proposed NLP data model and exchange format incorporating usability analysis into the agile development process. All deliverables will be distributed through the open health NLP (OHNLP) consortium which we intend to make it more open and inclusive.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to an unprecedented expansion in the availability of dense longitudinal datasets for clinical and translational research.

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work.              Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.

"Text Processing and Geospatial Uncertainty for Phylogeography of Zoonotic Viruses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phylogeography of zoonotic viruses studies the geographical spread and genetic lineages of viruses that are transmittable between animals and humans such as avian influenza and rabies. This science can help state public health and agriculture agencies identify the animal hosts that most impact virus propagation in a particular geographic region, the migration path of the virus including its origin, and the patterns of infection in various host populations, including humans, over time. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), specifically GenBank, provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. However, geospatial metadata such as host location is inconsistently represented and sparse across GenBank entries, with our preliminary studies showing only about 20% of the GenBank records contain specific information such as a county, town, or region within a state. While this detailed geospatial information might be included in the corresponding journal article, it is not available for immediate use in a bioinformatics or GIS application unless it is manually extracted and linked back to the appropriate sequence. Absence of precise sampling locations from easily-computable secondary data sources such as GenBank increases the difficulty of achieving accurate phylogeographic models of virus migration. We propose an infrastructure to improve phylogeographic models of virus migration by linking relevant geospatial data from the literature. This work represents the first effort to use automatically extracted geospatial data present in journal articles corresponding to GenBank records in order to enhance modeling of virus migration. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the data extracted in Aim 1 with adequate biostatistical models (Aim 2), and evaluating the impact of our approach for phylogeography and surveillance of zoonotic viruses (Aim 3). Thus, this work will provide researchers with a framework for population surveillance using an integrated biomedical informatics approach including NLP, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and database design.           We will create Natural Language Processing Infrastructure and novel phylogeographic models of zoonotic viruses that will allow state public health and agriculture agencies and other researchers to study virus migration. This will enhance population health surveillance including identification of the animal hosts that most impact virus propagation in a particular geographic region, the migration path of zoonotic pathogens, and the patterns of infection in various host populations over time, including humans. This resource will enable state agencies to implement improved public health control measures that will reduce morbidity and mortality of animals and humans from zoonotic diseases.

"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8578484,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,590023,0.03255376673911745
"POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project focuses on clinical natural language processing (cNLP), a field of emerging importance in informatics. Starting with the Linguistic String Project's Medical Language Processor (New York University) in the 1970s, researchers have made steady gains in cNLP through empirical studies and by building sophisticated high-level cNLP software applications (e.g., Columbia's MedLEE). There are no fewer than four scientific conferences devoted exclusively to biomedical/clinical NLP. The cNLP literature has been growing over the past decade, and this will gain momentum as more clinical text repositories are released, such as the MIMIC II and University of Pittsburgh BLU Lab corpora.       However, sustained success in the field of cNLP is hampered by the reality that clinical texts have a far more noise than do texts traditionally studied in NLP, such as newswire articles, biomedical abstracts, and discharge summaries. Noise in this context is defined by the parseability characteristics of the language and the linguistic structures that appear in text. Clinical texts come in a striking variety of note types, with the best studied types being discharge summaries, radiology reports, and pathology reports. These note types share an important feature: they are written to communicate care issues between healthcare providers and hence typically are well-composed, well-edited, and often are dictated. But the vast majority of notes in the electronic health record are written primarily to document care issues. They communicate as well, of course, but much less care is used in their creation than with discharge summaries and reports. As a result they are often ungrammatical; are composed of short, telegraphic phrases; are replete with misspellings and shorthand (e.g., abbreviations); are ill-formatted with templates and liberal use of white space; and are embedded with ""non-prose"" (e.g., strings of laboratory values). All of these sources of noise complicate otherwise straightforward NLP tasks like tokenization, sentence segmentation, and ultimately information extraction itself.       We propose a systematic study of ways to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in clinical narratives to improve cNLP. This work extends our preliminary research (under the POET project) and has the following aims:        o Develop and implement a suite of parseability improvement tools designed for all clinical note types from multiple healthcare institutions.     o Evaluate the empirical and the functional success of the parseability improvement tools.     o Design and implement a HIPAA-compliant UlMA-based pipeline cNLP framework for use in a typical high-performance, multi-processor computing environment.              Project Narrative We can see in the multi-billion dollar investment in electronic health records (EHRs) by the ARRA that mining clinical data electronically will continue to be essential to informatics research. Most data in the EHR resides as unstructured text, and POET2 provides a means to unlock that data through combining a new, HIPAA- complaint high-performance computing architecture with sophisticated text preprocessing.",POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing,8536940,R01LM010981,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proliferating', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'pressure', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research study', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2013,292186,0.061946149364726956
"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology.

"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.

"Integration of an NLP-based application to support medication management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. Stage 1 of Meaningful Use requires certified EHRs to be capable of providing a user with the ability to perform medication reconciliation. However, most previous studies have taken place in the inpatient setting, while medication reconciliation in the outpatient setting is importnt and challenging. In addition, clinical notes contain critical medication information that also need to be reconciled. Our goal of this study is to develop novel methods and a system using natural language processing (NLP) and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process in the ambulatory setting. Our specific aims are to : 1) identify the requirements, use cases, work flow issues, barriers to and facilitators of using clinical notes and a NLP-based system in the medication reconciliation process; 2) design a generic system architecture and an application that integrates an NLP system and a web-based user interface within an existing medication reconciliation system; 3) pilot this study in two primary care clinics and measure the utilization, usability, performance and feasibility of the proposed methods and the tool; and 4) distribute our methods and the tool and to make them widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.          An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. In thi study, we will develop novel methods and a tool using natural language processing and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction (transfer) Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible. In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.","Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction (transfer)",8868500,R01GM090187,[' '],NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2013,297936,0.1301274277860646

"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Cancer Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically extract medical problems and allergies, implementing a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first, and also enhance positive predictive value; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and it is output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented.

"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8345041,R01LM011366,"['Address', 'Age', 'Applied Research', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Disclosure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Son', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'efficacy testing', 'male', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2012,318849,0.04425902532320632
"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,8305149,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nitroglycerin', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Reader', 'Records', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'phrases', 'satisfaction']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,129035,0.059166356028819964
"Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automatic extraction, indexing, searching, and interpretation of EHRs are in development; however, due to privacy concerns related to EHRs, such technologies are usually developed by teams that have privileged access to EHRs in a specific institution. Technologies that are tailored to a specific set of data from a given institution generate inspiring results on that data; however, they can fail to generalize to similar data from other institutions and even other departments from the same institution. Therefore, learning from these technologies and building on them becomes difficult.          In order to improve NLP in EHRs, there is need for head-to-head comparison of approaches that can address a given task on the same data set. Shared-tasks provide one way of conducting systematic head-to- head comparisons. This proposal describes a series of shared-task challenges and conferences, spread over a five year period, that promote the development and evaluation of cutting edge clinical NLP systems by distributing de-identified EHRs to the broad research community, under data use agreements, so that:      *	the state-of-the-art in clinical NLP technologies can be identified and advanced,      *	a set of technologies that enable the use of the information contained in EHR narratives becomes available, and      *	the information from EHR narratives can be made more accessible, for example, for clinical and medical research.          The scientific activities supporting the organization of the shared-task challenges are sponsored in part by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), grant number U54-LM008748, PI: Kohane.          This proposal aims to organize a series of workshops, conference proceedings, and journal special issues that will accompany the shared-task challenges in order to disseminate the knowledge generated by the challenges.                  Public health relevance: this proposal will address two main challenges related to the use of clinical narratives for research: availability of clinical records for research and identification of the state of the art in clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies so that we can push the state of the art forward and so that future work can build on the past.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",8318253,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2012,327503,0.03219843402928712
"Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A critical element of translating science into practice is the ability to find patient populations for clinical research. Many studies rely on administrative data for selecting relevant patients for studies of comparative effectiveness, but the limitations of administrative data is well-known. Much of the information critical for clinical research is locked in free-text dictated reports, such as history and physical exams and radiology reports. Data repositories, such as the Medical Archival Retrieval System (MARS) at the University of Pittsburgh, are useful for identifying supersets of patients for clinical research studies through indexed word searches. However, simple text-based queries are also limited in their effectiveness, and researchers are often left reading through hundreds or thousands of reports to filter out false positive cases. Current processes are time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive. They lead to long delays between the development of a testable hypothesis and the ability to share findings with the medical community at large.       A potential solution to this problem is pre-annotating de-identified clinical reports to facilitate more intelligent and sophisticated retrieval and review. Clinical reports are rich in meaning and structure and can be annotated at many different levels using natural language processing technology. It is not clear, however, what types of annotations would be most helpful to a clinical researcher, nor is it clear how to display the annotations to best assist manual review of reports. There is interdependence between the annotation schema used by an NLP system and the user interface for assisting researchers in retrieving data for retrospective studies. In this proposal, we will interactively revise an NLP annotation schema as well as explore various methods for annotation display based on feedback from users reviewing patient data for specific research studies.       We hypothesize that an interactive search application that relies on NLP-annotated clinical text will increase the accuracy and efficiency of finding patients for clinical research studies and will support visualization techniques for viewing the data in a way that improves a researcher's ability to review patient data.              Narrative We will develop a novel review application for this proposal that will facilitate translational research from secondary use of EHR data by assisting researchers in more efficiently finding retrospective populations of patients for clinical research studies. The application will rely both on multi-layered annotation of the textual data, using natural langauge processing, and on coordinated views of the patient data.",Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann,8333306,R01LM010964,"['Automated Annotation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Imagery', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer human interaction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'research study', 'success']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2012,592423,0.0731563136436081
"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.

"Contextual ASR to Support EHR Adoption    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems is a national healthcare priority. However studies show massive physician productivity drop of up to 25-40% upon transition to EHR. The majority of workflow delay is based on the need to perform manual operations to fill structured forms within the EHR, as opposed to simple unstructured narratives used in traditional written notes and transcriptions. Vanguard Medical Technologies (VMT), under NIH grant 1R43LM010750, proved feasibility for DocTalk, a real-time, speech-driven, open-source augmented, small practice encounter recording system that processes voice to text to structured medical data to EHR input, utilizing integrated automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) in the cloud. While NLP accuracy in Phase I was high, voice accuracy prior to physician review was inadequate. Fortunately, the tight integration of ASR and NLP combined with the formal structure of physician notes offers unique context based approaches to address the challenge. Current speech recognition methods use a single general-purpose medical lexicon to train a recognizer when identifying words. Medical context-specific probabilities are ignored. The four Specific Aims of this Phase I SBIR project are to: 1. Create a textual corpus for each section of a patient encounter note by processing 1 million text based narrative structured encounter notes 2. Build a family of Section-Specific Statistical Language Models (SS-SLMs) specialized in recognizing speech pertaining to each specific section of a patient encounter note, using industry standard open source statistical language modeling tools. 3. Use NLP techniques to infer patterns of language usage from text of each section, a. To detect section boundaries to be used as trigger words for invoking SS-SLMs b. To determine characteristic word distributions of each section 4. Assess improvement in accuracy per section due to use of SS-SLMs, with the goal of 50% overall reduction of errors compared to non-section-specific SLMs in the same medical dictation system.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of this innovative proposed program of NLP-enhanced context based ASR, will provide the accuracy required to deploy an integrated, interactive, intuitive, low-cost data entry system for small practice primary care physicians. The augmented DocTalk system will enable physicians to increase usable information, avoid third-party transcription errors, and mitigate workflow delays. Increased small practice EHR adoption directly addresses national healthcare goals.              Successful completion of this innovative proposed program of NLP-enhanced context based ASR, will provide the accuracy required to deploy an integrated, interactive, intuitive, low-cost data entry system for small practice primary care physicians.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Applying NLP to Free Text as an EHR Data Capture Method to Improve EHR Usability     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to ensure the ability of ""NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation,"" a method of EHR data capture involving Natural Language Processing and possibly also standard EHR data capture, to improve the usability of EHR by reducing documentation time, increasing documentation quality, and increasing clinician satisfaction. Problem to be Addressed. Limited usability of the Electronic Health Record (""EHR"") and lack of standardized terminology impedes EHR adoption and optimal use, and therefore hinders realization of a universally interoperable and evidence-based reportable health care system. Large amounts of time required for documentation, low clinician satisfaction, and incomplete documentation are problems plaguing EHR. Innovation. Current research has demonstrated that NLP may be used for EHR data capture. ZyDoc is furthering the state of research by assessing the capability of NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation to improve EHR usability along several criteria. Long Term Goal. By enabling interoperability and improving EHR usability, through improving clinician satisfaction, improving documentation quality, and reducing data capture time, MediSapien will encourage widespread EHR adoption and optimal use with structured data. Phase I Summary. The purpose of the first Specific Aim of this grant proposal is to ensure that NLP- Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation is capable of improving clinician satisfaction, efficiency, and documentation quality, relative to standard EHR data capture methods. The purpose of the second Specific Aim is to improve the accuracy of MediSapien's coding. These Specific Aims will ensure the technical feasibility of NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation and MediSapien for improving EHR usability. Phase II Objectives. In Phase II, ZyDoc will complete product development, beta test MediSapien at two hospitals, and measure the product's impact on clinical outcomes or documentation results. Commercial Opportunity. ZyDoc will offer MediSapien as a modular component by partnering with vendors that combine MediSapien in their own solutions, enabling their clients to meet EHR meaningful use standards.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited usability of the Electronic Health Record (""EHR"") and lack of standardized terminology impedes EHR adoption and meaningful use, and therefore hinders realization of a universally interoperable and evidence- based reportable health care system.

"POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project focuses on clinical natural language processing (cNLP), a field of emerging importance in informatics. Starting with the Linguistic String Project's Medical Language Processor (New York University) in the 1970s, researchers have made steady gains in cNLP through empirical studies and by building sophisticated high-level cNLP software applications (e.g., Columbia's MedLEE). There are no fewer than four scientific conferences devoted exclusively to biomedical/clinical NLP. The cNLP literature has been growing over the past decade, and this will gain momentum as more clinical text repositories are released, such as the MIMIC II and University of Pittsburgh BLU Lab corpora.       However, sustained success in the field of cNLP is hampered by the reality that clinical texts have a far more noise than do texts traditionally studied in NLP, such as newswire articles, biomedical abstracts, and discharge summaries. Noise in this context is defined by the parseability characteristics of the language and the linguistic structures that appear in text. Clinical texts come in a striking variety of note types, with the best studied types being discharge summaries, radiology reports, and pathology reports. These note types share an important feature: they are written to communicate care issues between healthcare providers and hence typically are well-composed, well-edited, and often are dictated. But the vast majority of notes in the electronic health record are written primarily to document care issues. They communicate as well, of course, but much less care is used in their creation than with discharge summaries and reports. As a result they are often ungrammatical; are composed of short, telegraphic phrases; are replete with misspellings and shorthand (e.g., abbreviations); are ill-formatted with templates and liberal use of white space; and are embedded with ""non-prose"" (e.g., strings of laboratory values). All of these sources of noise complicate otherwise straightforward NLP tasks like tokenization, sentence segmentation, and ultimately information extraction itself.       We propose a systematic study of ways to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in clinical narratives to improve cNLP. This work extends our preliminary research (under the POET project) and has the following aims:        o Develop and implement a suite of parseability improvement tools designed for all clinical note types from multiple healthcare institutions.     o Evaluate the empirical and the functional success of the parseability improvement tools.     o Design and implement a HIPAA-compliant UlMA-based pipeline cNLP framework for use in a typical high-performance, multi-processor computing environment.              Project Narrative We can see in the multi-billion dollar investment in electronic health records (EHRs) by the ARRA that mining clinical data electronically will continue to be essential to informatics research. Most data in the EHR resides as unstructured text, and POET2 provides a means to unlock that data through combining a new, HIPAA- complaint high-performance computing architecture with sophisticated text preprocessing.",POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing,8326648,R01LM010981,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proliferating', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'pressure', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research study', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2012,318393,0.061946149364726956
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying  factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal  treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological  research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public  records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained.  Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at  hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data  source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the  wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical  information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that  information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as  selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical  methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for  observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing  EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient  manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will  contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based  information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information  from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to  analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the  standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the  capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost.   The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to  extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and  use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both case-  control and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon  cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two  major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our  study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Project Narrative  According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various  types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language  processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from  existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related  epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,8298614,R01CA141307,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prognostic indicator', 'public health research', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,56569,0.04165700739585857
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach  Abstract The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.

"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology.

"Integration of an NLP-based application to support medication management     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors. Stage 1 of Meaningful Use requires certified EHRs to be capable of providing a user with the ability to perform medication reconciliation. However, most previous studies have taken place in the inpatient setting, while medication reconciliation in the outpatient setting is importnt and challenging. In addition, clinical notes contain critical medication information that also need to be reconciled. Our goal of this study is to develop novel methods and a system using natural language processing (NLP) and other technologies to facilitate the medication reconciliation process in the ambulatory setting. Our specific aims are to : 1) identify the requirements, use cases, work flow issues, barriers to and facilitators of using clinical notes and a NLP-based system in the medication reconciliation process; 2) design a generic system architecture and an application that integrates an NLP system and a web-based user interface within an existing medication reconciliation system; 3) pilot this study in two primary care clinics and measure the utilization, usability, performance and feasibility of the proposed methods and the tool; and 4) distribute our methods and the tool and to make them widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An accurate and complete medication list on a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is critical to prevent prescribing and administration errors.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.

"An insilico method for epidemiological studies using Electonic Medical Records Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying  factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal  treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological  research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public  records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained.  Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at  hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data  source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the  wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical  information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that  information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as  selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical  methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for  observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing  EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient  manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will  contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based  information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information  from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to  analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the  standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the  capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost.   The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to  extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and  use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both case-  control and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon  cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two  major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our  study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Project Narrative  According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various  types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language  processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from  existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related  epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An insilico method for epidemiological studies using Electonic Medical Records,8589201,R01CA141307,[' '],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2012,195838,0.039482323021115345
"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",8105502,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2011,333575,0.03219843402928712
"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research.

"Interactive Search and Review of Clinical Records with Multi-layered Semantic Ann    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A critical element of translating science into practice is the ability to find patient populations for clinical research. Many studies rely on administrative data for selecting relevant patients for studies of comparative effectiveness, but the limitations of administrative data is well-known. Much of the information critical for clinical research is locked in free-text dictated reports, such as history and physical exams and radiology reports. Data repositories, such as the Medical Archival Retrieval System (MARS) at the University of Pittsburgh, are useful for identifying supersets of patients for clinical research studies through indexed word searches. However, simple text-based queries are also limited in their effectiveness, and researchers are often left reading through hundreds or thousands of reports to filter out false positive cases. Current processes are time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive. They lead to long delays between the development of a testable hypothesis and the ability to share findings with the medical community at large.       A potential solution to this problem is pre-annotating de-identified clinical reports to facilitate more intelligent and sophisticated retrieval and review. Clinical reports are rich in meaning and structure and can be annotated at many different levels using natural language processing technology. It is not clear, however, what types of annotations would be most helpful to a clinical researcher, nor is it clear how to display the annotations to best assist manual review of reports. There is interdependence between the annotation schema used by an NLP system and the user interface for assisting researchers in retrieving data for retrospective studies. In this proposal, we will interactively revise an NLP annotation schema as well as explore various methods for annotation display based on feedback from users reviewing patient data for specific research studies.       We hypothesize that an interactive search application that relies on NLP-annotated clinical text will increase the accuracy and efficiency of finding patients for clinical research studies and will support visualization techniques for viewing the data in a way that improves a researcher's ability to review patient data.              Narrative We will develop a novel review application for this proposal that will facilitate translational research from secondary use of EHR data by assisting researchers in more efficiently finding retrospective populations of patients for clinical research studies.

"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation.  Project Narrative According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,8110041,R01CA141307,"['Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cost', 'prevent']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,252298,0.04183371317937909
"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,8306467,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2011,13000,0.04003087326129737
"POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project focuses on clinical natural language processing (cNLP), a field of emerging importance in informatics. Starting with the Linguistic String Project's Medical Language Processor (New York University) in the 1970s, researchers have made steady gains in cNLP through empirical studies and by building sophisticated high-level cNLP software applications (e.g., Columbia's MedLEE). There are no fewer than four scientific conferences devoted exclusively to biomedical/clinical NLP. The cNLP literature has been growing over the past decade, and this will gain momentum as more clinical text repositories are released, such as the MIMIC II and University of Pittsburgh BLU Lab corpora.       However, sustained success in the field of cNLP is hampered by the reality that clinical texts have a far more noise than do texts traditionally studied in NLP, such as newswire articles, biomedical abstracts, and discharge summaries. Noise in this context is defined by the parseability characteristics of the language and the linguistic structures that appear in text. Clinical texts come in a striking variety of note types, with the best studied types being discharge summaries, radiology reports, and pathology reports. These note types share an important feature: they are written to communicate care issues between healthcare providers and hence typically are well-composed, well-edited, and often are dictated. But the vast majority of notes in the electronic health record are written primarily to document care issues. They communicate as well, of course, but much less care is used in their creation than with discharge summaries and reports. As a result they are often ungrammatical; are composed of short, telegraphic phrases; are replete with misspellings and shorthand (e.g., abbreviations); are ill-formatted with templates and liberal use of white space; and are embedded with ""non-prose"" (e.g., strings of laboratory values). All of these sources of noise complicate otherwise straightforward NLP tasks like tokenization, sentence segmentation, and ultimately information extraction itself.       We propose a systematic study of ways to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in clinical narratives to improve cNLP. This work extends our preliminary research (under the POET project) and has the following aims:        o Develop and implement a suite of parseability improvement tools designed for all clinical note types from multiple healthcare institutions.     o Evaluate the empirical and the functional success of the parseability improvement tools.     o Design and implement a HIPAA-compliant UlMA-based pipeline cNLP framework for use in a typical high-performance, multi-processor computing environment.              Project Narrative We can see in the multi-billion dollar investment in electronic health records (EHRs) by the ARRA that mining clinical data electronically will continue to be essential to informatics research. Most data in the EHR resides as unstructured text, and POET2 provides a means to unlock that data through combining a new, HIPAA- complaint high-performance computing architecture with sophisticated text preprocessing.",POET-2: High-performance computing for advanced clinical narrative preprocessing,8182025,R01LM010981,"['Abbreviations', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proliferating', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'pressure', 'repaired', 'repository', 'research study', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2011,325163,0.061946149364726956
"Genetic Discovery and  Application in a Clinical Setting Continuing a Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle eMERGE project aims to bring personal genomics to practice settings by taking advantage of the extensive electronic medical record (EMR) and biorepository of Group Health Cooperative (GH), including a 33-year pharmacy database and longitudinal data on an aging population. Algorithms developed in eMERGE I will be used to combine genome-wide association studies with phenotypes mined from EMRs to discover new polymorphism-phenotype relationships. Target phenotypes are infectious disease susceptibility, specifically to Clostridium difficile diarrhea, shingles from varicella zoster virus, and fungal nail infection, responses to antihypertensive drugs, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, and statins, including adverse events. A new algorithm will follow longitudinal glycemia and hematocrit trajectories, and a novel automated method will detect karyotype abnormalities for assessing correlation to myelodysplasia and leukemia. Data will also support phenotypes investigated at other eMERGE sites. To create a model for introducing genomics into clinical practice, successful needs assessment methods from eMERGE I will engage stakeholders in guiding development of prototype EMR user interfaces in a clinical decision support format. The test case will be human leukocyte antigen-typing for an adverse drug reaction and the setting will be the patient-centered medical home care model developed at GH. This proposal provides the eMERGE network and its collaborators with the Seattle team's unique expertise in using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from EMRs, and assisting in adoption of NLP methods. To disseminate eMERGE results and foster collaborations, it takes advantage of leadership positions of the investigators, including partners within eMERGE, other consortia and the HMO Research network, especially the potential for developments supported by the NIH Director's Common Fund in biobanking and megaepidemiology. Completion of the aims will reveal new, medically useful markers, improve the linking of high-throughput genomic methods to EMR data, and develop policies and practices for bringing individualized evidence-based medicine to communities.       RELEVANCE (See instrucfions): To advance personalized medicine-treatment and preventive care based on individual traits; this project matches small differences in DNA to infectious disease susceptibility and response to statins, serotonin- specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and blood pressure medications.

In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"A Hybrid General Natural Language Processing Architecture    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records and exchanges offer new opportunities for the analysis of population health data; however, new methods in natural language processing (NLP) must first be developed to structure and codify these records, since most medical data is in the form of free text which cannot be stored and manipulated by computers. Once this is accomplished, population health data can be analyzed which will lead to better treatment guidelines, targeted drug therapy, and more cost effective care. Logical Semantics, Inc. (LSI) proposes to develop new statistical NLP methods for analyzing large scale medical domains. These methods will leverage LSI's semantic annotation technology, which has created the largest semantically annotated clinical corpus in the world. LSI's goal is to semantically index large medical record repositories accurately against propositions arranged in knowledge ontologies and make these indices available for text mining applications. The phase one research is focused on three specific aims that will lead to breakthroughs in the science of NLP: (1) Develop new statistical NLP algorithms employing a large semantically annotated medical corpus, (2) Semi-automate knowledge ontology generation, and (3) Develop and combine rule based with statistical NLP algorithms to create a superior hybrid NLP system. The achievement of these aims will result in computer systems that can extract the meaning from free text medical records so researchers, policy makers, and clinicians can use health analytics to improve healthcare.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Natural language processing (NLP) has been successful in extracting specific findings and diagnoses from free text medical records.

"Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key prerequisite for high-quality healthcare delivery is effective communication within and across healthcare settings. However, communication can be hampered by the pervasive use of abbreviations in clinical notes. Clinicians use abbreviations to save time during documentation. While abbreviations may seem unambiguous to their authors, they often cause confusion to other readers, including healthcare providers, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems attempting to extract clinical terms from text. While the understanding that abbreviations can cause errors is widespread, few have deployed pragmatic solutions for this important problem. The proposed project will develop, evaluate, and share a systematic approach to Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (CARD), and in doing so substantially aims to benefit existing NLP systems and to improve computer-based documentation systems by reducing ambiguities in electronic records in real-time. The study includes the following five Specific Aims: 1) Develop automated methods to detect abbreviations and their senses from clinical text corpora and build a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical abbreviations; 2) Develop and evaluate three automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and establish methods to combine those classifiers to maximize both their performance and coverage; 3) Develop the CARD system, and demonstrate its effectiveness by integrating it with two established NLP systems (MedLEE and KnowledgeMap); 4) Integrate CARD with an institutional clinical documentation system (Vanderbilt's StarNotes) and evaluate its ability to expand abbreviations in real-time as clinicians generate records; 5) Distribute the CARD knowledge base and software for non-commercial uses.              Project Narrative Abbreviations are widely used throughout all types of clinical documents and they cause confusion to both healthcare providers and patients and limit effective communications within and across care settings. This proposed study will develop informatics methods to automatically detect abbreviations and their possible meanings from large clinical text and to disambiguate abbreviations that have multiple meanings. We will also integrate those methods with clinical documentation systems so that abbreviations will be expanded in real-time when physicians entering clinical notes, thus to improve the quality of health records.",Real-time Disambiguation of Abbreviations in Clinical Notes,7866149,R01LM010681,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nitroglycerin', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Reader', 'Records', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'phrases', 'satisfaction']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,387500,0.059166356028819964
"Natural Language Processing to Study Epidemiology of Statin Side Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-101: Informatics for post-marketing surveillance. The overall goal of this study is to develop a generalizable framework for studying medication side effects recorded in narrative medical documents. We will implement and test this system on the example of epidemiologic characterization of side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (a.k.a. statins). Statins are the most commonly used class of medications for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the U.S. In randomized clinical trials statins are associated only with a slight increase in adverse reactions and no increase in discontinuation of treatment compared to placebo. However, in clinical practice the rates of side effects and discontinuation appear significantly higher and represent a major barrier to a critical, potentially lifesaving therapy. For example, myalgias are reported to be relatively rare in clinical trials but are thought to be more common in clinical practice. Additionally, a number of other statin-associated complaints reported anecdotally but not well elucidated in clinical trials include depression, irritability, and memory loss among others. Most of these have been poorly epidemiologically characterized and their prevalence and risk factors remain unknown. Structured electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data have been used to study medication side effects. However, structured data have important limitations. They may not contain temporal or causative information necessary to link particular problems to medications and may not be sufficiently granular to identify specific adverse reactions. Narrative EMR data, such as provider notes, can provide documentation of causative links between medication and adverse events at high levels of granularity. Natural language processing (NLP) is an emerging technology that enables computational abstraction of information from narrative medical documents. In prior work we have successfully applied natural language processing to abstract medication information from narrative provider notes, including medication intensification, medication non-adherence and medication discontinuation. We will leverage these tools and the extensive EMR infrastructure at Partners HealthCare to develop and test a natural language processing system to study medication side effects. We will validate this system on the example of studying epidemiology of adverse reactions to statins. The findings of this project will lay the foundation for an open-source system that can be used for post-marketing surveillance of medication side effects using narrative EMR data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Frequency and risk factors for side effects of statins (medications used to treat high cholesterol) in everyday medical practice (as opposed to research studies) are not known. In this project we will design a system for analyzing the information about statin side effects in the electronic medical records.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",7779983,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Arts', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,343397,0.03219843402928712
"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases.

"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7942766,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'post-market', 'practice-based research network', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,320155,0.05924888839457115
"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.           Project narrative: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Narrative: According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language  processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from  existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related  epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,7925776,R01CA141307,"['Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cost', 'prevent']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,259993,0.04184235131937467
"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7893787,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2010,1512082,0.04003087326129737
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy).

"Enhancing Clinical Effectiveness Research with Natural Language Processing of EMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To successfully use large linked clinical databases for comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires addressing some key informatics challenges associated with distributed, heterogeneous clinical data. Electronic networks of researchers are part of the solution because they can bridge the physical and organizational divides created by distinct health systems' individual electronic medical records (EMRs). In addition, informatics research has demonstrated the feasibility of automatically coding clinical text, enhancing the capacity to integrate both unstructured and non-standardized clinical data from EMRs. With this study, we propose to develop CER infrastructure, make broadly available the proven MediClass technology for automated classification of EMRs containing both coded data and text clinical notes, and demonstrate the potential of this infrastructure for addressing CER questions within the asthma and tobacco-using patient populations of 6 diverse health systems. Asthma and smoking each impose huge and modifiable burdens on the healthcare system, and multiple morbidities related to asthma and smoking have been targeted by the IOM and AHRQ as priority areas in efforts to improve the healthcare system through comparative effectiveness research. We propose to develop, deploy, operate and evaluate the CER HUB, an Internet-based platform for conducting CER, and to demonstrate its utility in studying clinical interventions in asthma and smoking. Researchers who register to use the HUB, beginning with the research team from the 6 participating study sites, will be able to use a secure website to configure and download MediClass applications addressing CER questions within their respective healthcare organizations, to contribute these IRB-approved, processed datasets back to a centralized data coordinating center to be pooled with data similarly processed from other healthcare organizations, and to use the pooled database to answer diverse comparative effectiveness questions of large, real-world populations. A central function of the CER HUB will be facilitating (through online, interactive tools) development of a shared library of MediClass knowledge modules that afford uniform, standardized coding of EMR data. This shared library of knowledge modules could permit researchers to assess effectiveness in multiple areas of healthcare and gain access to data otherwise locked away in text clinical notes. A goal of the CER HUB is to accelerate creation of standardized knowledge used to normalize heterogeneous EMR data as representations of clinical events for CER. During the project period we will conduct 2 studies using this infrastructure to address the effectiveness of interventions for asthmatics and tobacco users across the 6 participating health systems.

"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists.

"Annotation, development and evaluation for clinical information extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much of the clinical information required for accurate clinical research, active decision support, and broad-coverage surveillance is locked in text files in an electronic medical record (EMR). The only feasible way to leverage this information for translational science is to extract and encode the information using natural language processing (NLP). Over the last two decades, several research groups have developed NLP tools for clinical notes, but a major bottleneck preventing progress in clinical NLP is the lack of standard, annotated data sets for training and evaluating NLP applications. Without these standards, individual NLP applications abound without the ability to train different algorithms on standard annotations, share and integrate NLP modules, or compare performance. We propose to develop standards and infrastructure that can enable technology to extract scientific information from textual medical records, and we propose the research as a collaborative effort involving NLP experts across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, we will address three specific aims: Aim 1: Extend existing standards and develop new consensus standards for annotating clinical text in a way that is interoperable, extensible, and usable. Aim 2: Apply existing methods and tools, and develop new methods and tools where necessary for manually annotating a set of publicly available clinical texts in a way that is efficient and accurate. Aim 3: Develop a publicly available toolkit for automatically annotating clinical text and perform a shared evaluation to evaluate the toolkit, using evaluation metrics that are multidimensional and flexible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research. We will experiment with methods for increasing the efficiency of annotation and will annotate de-identified reports of nine types for linguistic and clinical information. In addition, we will create an NLP toolkit that can be shared and will evaluate it against other NLP systems in a shared task evaluation with the community.           Project narrative: In this project, we will develop a publicly available corpus of annotated clinical texts for NLP research.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7933293,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,152617,0.05268955738788036
"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Analyzing and processing free-text medical reports for data mining and clinical data interchange is one of the most challenging problems in medical informatics, yet it is crucial for continued research advances and improvements in clinical care. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important enabling technology, but has been held back because it is difficult to understand human language, since it requires extensive domain knowledge. In Phase I, we developed new statistical and machine learning methods that apply domain specific knowledge to the semantic analysis of free-text radiology reports. The methods enabled the creation of two new prototype applications - a SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms) coding service called SnomedCoder, and a text mining tool for analyzing a large corpus of medical reports, called DataMiner. In Phase II, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Improve the semantic extraction methods developed in Phase I, 2) Expand the semantic knowledge base and classify at least two million new unique sentences from multiple medical institutions, 3) Provide a SNOMED CT auto coding service (alpha service) to participating Indiana Health Information Exchange hospitals, and 4) Build a commercial version of the DataMiner software, and test its functionality using researchers at the Regenstrief Institute.       These scientific innovations will revolutionize the ability of health care researchers to analyze vast repositories of clinical information currently locked up in electronic medical records, and correlate this data with new biomedical discoveries in proteonomics and genomics. The ability to codify text rapidly will extend the potential for clinical decision support beyond its narrow base of numeric and structured medical data, and enable SNOMED CT to become a useful coding standard. Phase III will offer coding and data mining services to healthcare payers (both private and government), pharmaceuticals, and academic researchers. A key advantage of our approach over other NLP systems is that we attempt to codify all the information in the report and not just a limited subset, and insist on expert validation which provides a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the coded data.Project Narrative           n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports,7554153,R44RR024929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'repository', 'research and development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCRR,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R44,2009,422728,0.05283338860116585
"Natural Language Processing to Study Epidemiology of Statin Side Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-101: Informatics for post-marketing surveillance. The overall goal of this study is to develop a generalizable framework for studying medication side effects recorded in narrative medical documents. We will implement and test this system on the example of epidemiologic characterization of side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (a.k.a. statins). Statins are the most commonly used class of medications for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the U.S. In randomized clinical trials statins are associated only with a slight increase in adverse reactions and no increase in discontinuation of treatment compared to placebo. However, in clinical practice the rates of side effects and discontinuation appear significantly higher and represent a major barrier to a critical, potentially lifesaving therapy. For example, myalgias are reported to be relatively rare in clinical trials but are thought to be more common in clinical practice. Additionally, a number of other statin-associated complaints reported anecdotally but not well elucidated in clinical trials include depression, irritability, and memory loss among others. Most of these have been poorly epidemiologically characterized and their prevalence and risk factors remain unknown. Structured electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data have been used to study medication side effects. However, structured data have important limitations. They may not contain temporal or causative information necessary to link particular problems to medications and may not be sufficiently granular to identify specific adverse reactions. Narrative EMR data, such as provider notes, can provide documentation of causative links between medication and adverse events at high levels of granularity. Natural language processing (NLP) is an emerging technology that enables computational abstraction of information from narrative medical documents. In prior work we have successfully applied natural language processing to abstract medication information from narrative provider notes, including medication intensification, medication non-adherence and medication discontinuation. We will leverage these tools and the extensive EMR infrastructure at Partners HealthCare to develop and test a natural language processing system to study medication side effects. We will validate this system on the example of studying epidemiology of adverse reactions to statins. The findings of this project will lay the foundation for an open-source system that can be used for post-marketing surveillance of medication side effects using narrative EMR data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Frequency and risk factors for side effects of statins (medications used to treat high cholesterol) in everyday medical practice (as opposed to research studies) are not known. In this project we will design a system for analyzing the information about statin side effects in the electronic medical records.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon.

"Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The electronic medical record (EMR) offers impressive opportunities for increasing care quality, but challenges stand in the way of realizing this vision. For example, coded EMR data readily available for analysis typically are incomplete (due to the prevalence of free-text clinical notes in EMR implementations), and data from different EMRs are often incommensurate due to differences in standard vocabularies and system implementations. While informatics research has shown the feasibility of automatically coding specific aspects of clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP), challenges remain for translating these informatics developments into large-scale care quality assessments. To date, successful NLP solutions for automated quality assessment have tended to be applications that are specific to (a) the target problem or clinical focus, (b) the EMR data system, and (c) the person or team that implements the NLP solution. In this study, we propose to begin addressing the problem of implementation team specificity by developing, evaluating, and making freely available a generalizable NLP development tool suite. The tools will enable widespread adoption of NLP systems to extract and code data from free text clinical notes. The Knowledge Editing Toolkit will simplify development of problem-specific knowledge by helping the user define the rules, concepts, and terms that constitute a domain-specific knowledge module, thus allowing any informaticist to develop an NLP application. The NLP Application Validation Toolkit will allow rapid testing and evaluation of the application against a gold standard of independently-coded test records from any EMR. To evaluate the effects of the toolkits on NLP generalizability, we will have three clinical informaticists each build two NLP applications (for a total of six distinct applications). One of their applications will identify a constellation of common clinical signs or symptoms (e.g., ""persistent cough"") that are relatively discrete concepts using simple language terms for many different clinical purposes. Their second application will assess behavioral counseling (e.g., ""alcohol counseling""), which uses complex language constructs for dedicated clinical purposes. We will describe and evaluate the accuracy of the solutions against independently coded test sets of medical records. We will quantify and compare the difficulty of creating these solutions as measured by the time, number of iterations required to build the applications, and the number of concepts and rules employed, as well as analyze variability in content and accuracy of the solutions created. In addition, we will use qualitative techniques to assess the ease of using the development tools; the difficulty in learning the tools; and specific types of problems, limitations, and bugs encountered.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases.

"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. Such a summary would enhance the manner in which both patients and their physicians access, process and marshal medical information.",An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries,7635002,R01LM010027,"['Address', 'Allergic', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Interview', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Marshal', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'data mining', 'design', 'information gathering', 'knowledge base', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'stem', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,455605,0.041598970577389226
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts. It has the potential of making the vast amount of available information in the health domain more accessible to the lay public.              n/a",Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts,7672256,R01DK075837,"['Address', 'Beds', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Labeling', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exercise', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health education', 'Home environment', 'Instruction', 'Internal Medicine', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Patients', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Smog', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer program', 'computerized', 'fourth grade', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'ninth grade', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tenth grade', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2009,398216,0.021732987192636614
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases. To achieve this goal, we propose a team that combines expertise in natural language processing systems (Carol Friedman), electronic health records (George Hripcsak), statistics in combined databases and computational virology (Raul Rabadan). This team will generate an interdisciplinary approach to mine and integrate the literature and the dataset collected at Columbia/New York Presbyterian hospital. Identifying unusual correlations in rare diseases is the first step to understanding the origin of the diseases and to finding a cure for them. We hypothesize that we will develop effective methods aimed at improving our understanding of rare diseases by combining hypothesis testing and hypothesis discovery, and by integrating information from the literature and from the patient record to obtain increased statistical power. This will involve using natural language processing and statistical methods to mine both the literature and the electronic health record (EHR).           Project Narrative We will test reported associations in rare diseases and discover new ones by integrating information from the literature and from Electronic Health Records in hospitals.",Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases,7727710,R01LM010140,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Informatics', 'Information Theory', 'Kaposi Sarcoma', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'blind', 'data mining', 'forgetting', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'repository', 'research study', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'virology', 'web site']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,533007,0.030113040063277106
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records    DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation.      Narrative: According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of   cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is   one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language   processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from   existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related   epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.      SPECIAL REVIEW NOTE: In order to conform to the scientific objectives outlined in the program announcement RFA-GM-09-008, EUREKA applications submitted to the NCI were initially evaluated by a group of reviewers representing diverse scientific interests. The priority score reflects the average of all the scores given by the full committee after a thorough discussion.            Project Narrative According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007.

"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine. This research will create a database of temporal orderings from events extracted from EHR patient narratives, using algorithms previously applied to news articles.",Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries,7789943,R21LM009633,"['Abbreviations', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Authorization documentation', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Libraries', 'Mining', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Records', 'Registered nurse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'acronyms', 'base', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'news', 'open source', 'repository', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,177750,0.04568984473425491
"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors.

"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.           Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4.

"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4.

"NLP Foundational Studies & Ontologies for Syndromic Surveillance from ED Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Many NLP applications have been successfully developed to extract information from text. Most of the   applications have focused on identifying individual clinical conditions in textual records, which is the first step in making the conditions available to computerized applications. However, identifying individual instances of clinical conditions is not sufficient for many medical informatics tasks - the context surrounding the condition is crucial for integrating the information within the text to determine the clinical state of a patient. We propose to perform in-depth studies on NLP issues requiring knowledge of the context of clinical conditions in clinical records. We will focus our research by using syndromic surveillance from emergency department (ED) reports as a case study.      For this proposal, we will test the following hypothesis: An NLP system that indexes clinical concepts and integrates contextual information modifying the concepts can identify acute clinical conditions from ED reports as well as physicians can.      We will identify clinical concepts necessary for surveillance of seven syndromes, including respiratory,   gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, hemorrhagic, constitutional, and botulinic. To evaluate the hypothesis, we will perform the following specific aims:      Aim 1. Perform in-depth, foundational studies on four NLP topics to gain a deeper understanding of the      pertinent NLP research capabilities required for identification of acute clinical conditions from ED reports, including negation, uncertainty, temporal discrimination, and finding validation;      Aim 2. Apply the knowledge learned from the foundational studies to develop and evaluate an automated application for ED reports that will determine the values for clinical variables relevant to identifying patients with any of seven syndromes.      The research is innovative, because it will generate an in-depth study of multiple NLP topics crucial to   understanding a patient's clinical state from textual records and will focus on contextual understanding and analysis. The research will be guided by linguistic principles, by the semantics and discourse structure of ED reports, and by the application area of biosurveillance. Because we will develop research methods and tools that are customized to a particular domain, we will constrain the research space, which will provide direction and enhance the chance for success.

"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists.

"POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As electronic health records (EHRs) continue their expansion into clinical settings, there has been a corresponding increase in interest in mining the data they contain, both for research as well as for clinical decision support. Informaticists are increasingly studying ways to mine EHR textual content. This is an important trend, because there is a wealth of information contained in clinical text not represented anywhere else in the EHR. There is a low level text-as-data issue which presents a significant obstacle to the widespread use of available medical NLP systems: hand-typed clinical narratives in EHRs are usually ungrammatical; short or telegraphic in style; full of abbreviations, acronyms, and misspellings; formatted in a templated or pseudo-tabular form; and contain embedded non-text such as a list of laboratory values cut-and-pasted from elsewhere in the EHR. As we show in the Preliminary Studies Section, this makes high-level processing by popular tools like MedLEE and MetaMap effectively useless for all but a few ""clean"" document types like discharge summaries or consult reports (e.g., pathology or radiology reports). This in turn explains why there is so little published about what is certainly the preponderance of clinical texts, those that are not as well-behaved lexically and syntactically as a discharge summary.       In this application we distinguish clinical narratives (e.g., a progress note) from biomedical narratives (e.g., a PubMed abstract). We are interested in texts that arise in the clinical or research setting; texts that are composed by clinicians and researchers directly into a computer system. We propose to build and publish a tool called POET (Parsable Output Extracted from Text). POET will be designed to accept unstructured textual documents and return structured, linguistic equivalents that are, to the extent possible, parsable by higher-level NLP engines. POET will have an architecture is modular, extensible, and based on open-source platforms and sources (e.g., Java, Perl, UMLS, NegEx, the Stanford Parser, HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, caGRID, etc.). To implement POET, we will collect, program, and evaluate published as well as novel algorithms for: acronym/abbreviation resolution; spelling correction; template and pseudo-table re-writing; and removal of embedded non-text. To test POET we will use a large corpus of cross-discipline (e.g., medical, nursing, pharmacy, etc.) clinical note types, as well as the clinical research texts MedWatch reports and IRB adverse event reports. The development of POET will combine the best practices found in the literature and new research efforts as part of the project. To validate the fidelity of POET processing we plan a formal analysis of information loss and information gain pre- and post-process. To ensure broad access to the tools, POET will be released under an open-source license. Finally, we plan to assess the feasibility of offering POET as a Web service for remote processing.           Public Health Relevance This project attempts the construction of POET, a low-level preprocessing system for full text that can be used to open up large portions of the electronic health record (EHR) to high-level NLP systems. The potential public health implications are: 1) POET will allow the expansion of the use of well-proven clinical NLP systems  (currently limited to only a few document types found in the EHR) to the entire  clinical text record; with the entirety of the clinical record accessible to NLP,  serious and realistic attempts at real-time clinical text surveillance can be  mounted to improve patient safety and quality of care; 2) POET will be made available through open source distribution and other means  to encourage the practical deployment of innovative decision support systems  using large healthcare network EHRs across the country; 3) POET meets an important translational public health informatics need by solving  persistent low-level barriers to effective data mining of clinical marriages in the  EHR.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7495030,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,338600,0.05268955738788036
"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Analyzing and processing free-text medical reports for data mining and clinical data interchange is one of the most challenging problems in medical informatics, yet it is crucial for continued research advances and improvements in clinical care. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important enabling technology, but has been held back because it is difficult to understand human language, since it requires extensive domain knowledge. In Phase I, we developed new statistical and machine learning methods that apply domain specific knowledge to the semantic analysis of free-text radiology reports. The methods enabled the creation of two new prototype applications - a SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms) coding service called SnomedCoder, and a text mining tool for analyzing a large corpus of medical reports, called DataMiner. In Phase II, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Improve the semantic extraction methods developed in Phase I, 2) Expand the semantic knowledge base and classify at least two million new unique sentences from multiple medical institutions, 3) Provide a SNOMED CT auto coding service (alpha service) to participating Indiana Health Information Exchange hospitals, and 4) Build a commercial version of the DataMiner software, and test its functionality using researchers at the Regenstrief Institute.       These scientific innovations will revolutionize the ability of health care researchers to analyze vast repositories of clinical information currently locked up in electronic medical records, and correlate this data with new biomedical discoveries in proteonomics and genomics. The ability to codify text rapidly will extend the potential for clinical decision support beyond its narrow base of numeric and structured medical data, and enable SNOMED CT to become a useful coding standard. Phase III will offer coding and data mining services to healthcare payers (both private and government), pharmaceuticals, and academic researchers. A key advantage of our approach over other NLP systems is that we attempt to codify all the information in the report and not just a limited subset, and insist on expert validation which provides a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the coded data.Project Narrative           n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Reports,7394699,R44RR024929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body of uterus', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'repository', 'research and development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCRR,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R44,2008,429955,0.05283338860116585
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,7429768,R01LM008635,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Improve Access', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Range', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Side', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical application', 'concept', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'model organisms databases', 'open source', 'research and development', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,534463,0.04368250067801255
"Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The absence of a flexible, robust, and accurate natural language interface is a significant barrier to the direct use of computer-based patient records by dental clinicians. While providing patient care, dentists, hygienists and assistants are handicapped in using a keyboard and mouse to interact with a computer, primarily because of infection control concerns. The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a prototype dental charting system with a speech-driven interface that will allow the dentist to chart dental conditions using natural language. The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the key concepts associated with 16 dental conditions from transcribed dental examinations. These concepts, coded using the standardized terminologies, would provide a structured summary of a patient's initial dental exam. The proposal has two aims: 1) evaluate the accuracy of speech recognition technology for clinical dental examinations; and 2) develop and evaluate an NLP application for mapping transcribed text to a structured dental chart. This proposal describes a new, exploratory and innovative research project that could radically impact the practice of dental charting. Expected outcomes for this proposal include: 1) an understanding of the accuracy of speech recognition for real-time dictated dental exams; and 2) NLP-based tools to automatically chart restorative and periodontal conditions for each tooth into a structured dental chart. This developmental work will provide a strong foundation for developing a chairside NLP-based dental charting application that would automatically generate a structured dental chart suitable for chairside decision support.          n/a",Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application,7478824,R21DE018158,"['Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Dictionaries', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Hygienists', 'Dental Informatics', 'Dental Offices', 'Dental Records', 'Dentistry', 'Dentists', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Infection Control', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Transcription', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Services', 'Speech', 'Speech Recognition Software', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'dental structure', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'restoration', 'speech recognition', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2008,177729,0.018225054503948016
"Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The electronic medical record (EMR) offers impressive opportunities for increasing care quality, but challenges stand in the way of realizing this vision. For example, coded EMR data readily available for analysis typically are incomplete (due to the prevalence of free-text clinical notes in EMR implementations), and data from different EMRs are often incommensurate due to differences in standard vocabularies and system implementations. While informatics research has shown the feasibility of automatically coding specific aspects of clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP), challenges remain for translating these informatics developments into large-scale care quality assessments. To date, successful NLP solutions for automated quality assessment have tended to be applications that are specific to (a) the target problem or clinical focus, (b) the EMR data system, and (c) the person or team that implements the NLP solution. In this study, we propose to begin addressing the problem of implementation team specificity by developing, evaluating, and making freely available a generalizable NLP development tool suite. The tools will enable widespread adoption of NLP systems to extract and code data from free text clinical notes. The Knowledge Editing Toolkit will simplify development of problem-specific knowledge by helping the user define the rules, concepts, and terms that constitute a domain-specific knowledge module, thus allowing any informaticist to develop an NLP application. The NLP Application Validation Toolkit will allow rapid testing and evaluation of the application against a gold standard of independently-coded test records from any EMR. To evaluate the effects of the toolkits on NLP generalizability, we will have three clinical informaticists each build two NLP applications (for a total of six distinct applications). One of their applications will identify a constellation of common clinical signs or symptoms (e.g., ""persistent cough"") that are relatively discrete concepts using simple language terms for many different clinical purposes. Their second application will assess behavioral counseling (e.g., ""alcohol counseling""), which uses complex language constructs for dedicated clinical purposes. We will describe and evaluate the accuracy of the solutions against independently coded test sets of medical records. We will quantify and compare the difficulty of creating these solutions as measured by the time, number of iterations required to build the applications, and the number of concepts and rules employed, as well as analyze variability in content and accuracy of the solutions created. In addition, we will use qualitative techniques to assess the ease of using the development tools; the difficulty in learning the tools; and specific types of problems, limitations, and bugs encountered. Such an NLP development tool suite has the potential to allow simple, elegant, and reliably good NLP solutions regardless of the clinical problem domain or the person developing the solution.           n/a",Investigating the generalizability of natural language processing of EMR data,7529967,R21LM009728,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Architecture', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coughing', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Event', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Research', 'Running', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'care delivery', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2008,213300,0.11531114651476979
"Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linguastat, Inc. proposes to develop a means to automate the process of monitoring and identifying companies engaged in false advertising and deceptive practices in the marketing of drugs, dietary supplements, and/or food products. By leveraging state of the art approaches in computational linguistics such as Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing, it should be feasible, with some adaptation, to use this technology to: 1) automatically and continuously monitor the websites, TV transcripts, press releases and other electronic marketing text communications of tens of thousands of companies for various claims and product information 2) automatically ""red-flag"" instances in which claims have a high likelihood of potential harm to consumers, according to FDA priorities 3) automatically identify and extract the companies, products and claims embedded in electronic product information and electronic promotional materials to create a database easily searchable by the FDA and 4) automatically capture web-based or other electronic content for human review and store it as ""evidence."" Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7677599,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2008,20000,0.038666365022065816
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7502672,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'concept', 'data modeling', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,1432331,0.04003087326129737
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4.

"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4.

"NLP Foundational Studies & Ontologies for Syndromic Surveillance from ED Reports    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Many NLP applications have been successfully developed to extract information from text. Most of the   applications have focused on identifying individual clinical conditions in textual records, which is the first step in making the conditions available to computerized applications. However, identifying individual instances of clinical conditions is not sufficient for many medical informatics tasks - the context surrounding the condition is crucial for integrating the information within the text to determine the clinical state of a patient. We propose to perform in-depth studies on NLP issues requiring knowledge of the context of clinical conditions in clinical records. We will focus our research by using syndromic surveillance from emergency department (ED) reports as a case study.      For this proposal, we will test the following hypothesis: An NLP system that indexes clinical concepts and integrates contextual information modifying the concepts can identify acute clinical conditions from ED reports as well as physicians can.      We will identify clinical concepts necessary for surveillance of seven syndromes, including respiratory,   gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, hemorrhagic, constitutional, and botulinic. To evaluate the hypothesis, we will perform the following specific aims:      Aim 1. Perform in-depth, foundational studies on four NLP topics to gain a deeper understanding of the      pertinent NLP research capabilities required for identification of acute clinical conditions from ED reports, including negation, uncertainty, temporal discrimination, and finding validation;      Aim 2. Apply the knowledge learned from the foundational studies to develop and evaluate an automated application for ED reports that will determine the values for clinical variables relevant to identifying patients with any of seven syndromes.      The research is innovative, because it will generate an in-depth study of multiple NLP topics crucial to   understanding a patient's clinical state from textual records and will focus on contextual understanding and analysis. The research will be guided by linguistic principles, by the semantics and discourse structure of ED reports, and by the application area of biosurveillance. Because we will develop research methods and tools that are customized to a particular domain, we will constrain the research space, which will provide direction and enhance the chance for success. However, the methods and tools generated by this research should be extensible to other clinical report types and to other domain applications, because we will explicitly specify and study NLP concepts and relationships that are common to many application areas.             n/a",NLP Foundational Studies & Ontologies for Syndromic Surveillance from ED Reports,7469551,R01LM009427,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Area', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Condition', 'Constitutional', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Exanthema', 'Exhibits', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Informatics Applications', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'computerized', 'concept', 'gastrointestinal', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'quality assurance', 'respiratory', 'success', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2008,392337,0.10488392921976396
"POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As electronic health records (EHRs) continue their expansion into clinical settings, there has been a corresponding increase in interest in mining the data they contain, both for research as well as for clinical decision support. Informaticists are increasingly studying ways to mine EHR textual content. This is an important trend, because there is a wealth of information contained in clinical text not represented anywhere else in the EHR. There is a low level text-as-data issue which presents a significant obstacle to the widespread use of available medical NLP systems: hand-typed clinical narratives in EHRs are usually ungrammatical; short or telegraphic in style; full of abbreviations, acronyms, and misspellings; formatted in a templated or pseudo-tabular form; and contain embedded non-text such as a list of laboratory values cut-and-pasted from elsewhere in the EHR. As we show in the Preliminary Studies Section, this makes high-level processing by popular tools like MedLEE and MetaMap effectively useless for all but a few ""clean"" document types like discharge summaries or consult reports (e.g., pathology or radiology reports). This in turn explains why there is so little published about what is certainly the preponderance of clinical texts, those that are not as well-behaved lexically and syntactically as a discharge summary.       In this application we distinguish clinical narratives (e.g., a progress note) from biomedical narratives (e.g., a PubMed abstract). We are interested in texts that arise in the clinical or research setting; texts that are composed by clinicians and researchers directly into a computer system. We propose to build and publish a tool called POET (Parsable Output Extracted from Text). POET will be designed to accept unstructured textual documents and return structured, linguistic equivalents that are, to the extent possible, parsable by higher-level NLP engines. POET will have an architecture is modular, extensible, and based on open-source platforms and sources (e.g., Java, Perl, UMLS, NegEx, the Stanford Parser, HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, caGRID, etc.). To implement POET, we will collect, program, and evaluate published as well as novel algorithms for: acronym/abbreviation resolution; spelling correction; template and pseudo-table re-writing; and removal of embedded non-text. To test POET we will use a large corpus of cross-discipline (e.g., medical, nursing, pharmacy, etc.) clinical note types, as well as the clinical research texts MedWatch reports and IRB adverse event reports. The development of POET will combine the best practices found in the literature and new research efforts as part of the project. To validate the fidelity of POET processing we plan a formal analysis of information loss and information gain pre- and post-process. To ensure broad access to the tools, POET will be released under an open-source license. Finally, we plan to assess the feasibility of offering POET as a Web service for remote processing.           Public Health Relevance This project attempts the construction of POET, a low-level preprocessing system for full text that can be used to open up large portions of the electronic health record (EHR) to high-level NLP systems. The potential public health implications are: 1) POET will allow the expansion of the use of well-proven clinical NLP systems  (currently limited to only a few document types found in the EHR) to the entire  clinical text record; with the entirety of the clinical record accessible to NLP,  serious and realistic attempts at real-time clinical text surveillance can be  mounted to improve patient safety and quality of care; 2) POET will be made available through open source distribution and other means  to encourage the practical deployment of innovative decision support systems  using large healthcare network EHRs across the country; 3) POET meets an important translational public health informatics need by solving  persistent low-level barriers to effective data mining of clinical marriages in the  EHR. The wider public health implications include promoting effective computerized decision support and data mining to improve both personal and public health outcomes.","POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing",7570254,R21LM009967,"['Abbreviations', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Systems', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Hand', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Output', 'Paste substance', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physical assessment', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'data mining', 'design', 'discrete data', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'spelling', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2008,169313,0.08348469372149576
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical inforrnatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6944955,F38LM008478,"['Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Inpatients', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Statistical Study', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'skills', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'ward']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2007,38768,0.06981354418312094
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7288319,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,345833,0.05268955738788036
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,7257857,R01LM008635,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Improve Access', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Range', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Side', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical application', 'concept', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'model organisms databases', 'open source', 'research and development', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,529014,0.04368250067801255
"Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The absence of a flexible, robust, and accurate natural language interface is a significant barrier to the direct use of computer-based patient records by dental clinicians. While providing patient care, dentists, hygienists and assistants are handicapped in using a keyboard and mouse to interact with a computer, primarily because of infection control concerns. The objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a prototype dental charting system with a speech-driven interface that will allow the dentist to chart dental conditions using natural language. The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the key concepts associated with 16 dental conditions from transcribed dental examinations. These concepts, coded using the standardized terminologies, would provide a structured summary of a patient's initial dental exam. The proposal has two aims: 1) evaluate the accuracy of speech recognition technology for clinical dental examinations; and 2) develop and evaluate an NLP application for mapping transcribed text to a structured dental chart. This proposal describes a new, exploratory and innovative research project that could radically impact the practice of dental charting. Expected outcomes for this proposal include: 1) an understanding of the accuracy of speech recognition for real-time dictated dental exams; and 2) NLP-based tools to automatically chart restorative and periodontal conditions for each tooth into a structured dental chart. This developmental work will provide a strong foundation for developing a chairside NLP-based dental charting application that would automatically generate a structured dental chart suitable for chairside decision support.          n/a",Feasibility of a Natural Language Processing-based Dental Charting Application,7305430,R21DE018158,"['Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Dictionaries', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Hygienists', 'Dental Informatics', 'Dental Offices', 'Dental Records', 'Dentistry', 'Dentists', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Infection Control', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Transcription', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Services', 'Speech', 'Speech Recognition Software', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'dental structure', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'restoration', 'speech recognition', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2007,229030,0.018225054503948016
"Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linguastat, Inc. proposes to develop a means to automate the process of monitoring and identifying companies engaged in false advertising and deceptive practices in the marketing of drugs, dietary supplements, and/or food products. By leveraging state of the art approaches in computational linguistics such as Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing, it should be feasible, with some adaptation, to use this technology to: 1) automatically and continuously monitor the websites, TV transcripts, press releases and other electronic marketing text communications of tens of thousands of companies for various claims and product information 2) automatically ""red-flag"" instances in which claims have a high likelihood of potential harm to consumers, according to FDA priorities 3) automatically identify and extract the companies, products and claims embedded in electronic product information and electronic promotional materials to create a database easily searchable by the FDA and 4) automatically capture web-based or other electronic content for human review and store it as ""evidence."" Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7326883,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2007,99773,0.038666365022065816
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts. It has the potential of making the vast amount of available information in the health domain more accessible to the lay public.              n/a",Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts,7303652,R01DK075837,"['Address', 'Beds', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Labeling', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exercise', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health education', 'Home environment', 'Instruction', 'Internal Medicine', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Patients', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Score', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'Smog', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer program', 'computerized', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tool']",NIDDK,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2007,435682,0.021732987192636614

Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance  existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of  health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted  readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing  techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive  impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine  clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts. It has the potential of making the vast amount of available information in the health domain more accessible to the lay public. n/a",Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts,7492453,R01DK075837,"['Address', 'Beds', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Labeling', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exercise', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health education', 'Home environment', 'Instruction', 'Internal Medicine', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Patients', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Score', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'Smog', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer program', 'computerized', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tool']",NIDDK,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2007,47853,0.021121519715994394
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7249382,R01EB000362,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Geographic Locations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Multimedia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Visit', 'base', 'concept', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'peer', 'point of care', 'portability', 'research clinical testing', 'urologic', 'usability']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,517331,0.04649878070445692
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,7272822,R01EB002247,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Body of uterus', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Oncologist', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Slice', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teleconsultations', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Upper arm', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'health care quality', 'image registration', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'size', 'telehealth']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,394864,0.045515439343851605
"Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  VGER: The Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Record project An important potential enabling resource for Personalized Medicine is the combination of a DNA repository with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems sufficiently robust to provide excellence in clinical care and to serve as resources for analysis of disease susceptibility and therapeutic outcomes across patient populations. The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.           n/a",Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project,7427367,U01HG004603,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Ethics', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'concept', 'data modeling', 'egg', 'endophenotype', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rhythm', 'indexing', 'repository', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,U01,2007,1463449,0.04003087326129737
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy). The implications of this portfolio of research extend far beyond the specific phenotypes we have chosen to emphasize; we expect this work represents the beginning of a large and productive enterprise.              n/a",Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies,7427364,U01HG004610,"['Abbreviations', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Elevation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Myalgia', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Washington', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'development policy', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health care delivery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'patient registry', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'prospective', 'success', 'trait', 'virtual']",NHGRI,GROUP HEALTH COOPERATIVE,U01,2007,970601,-0.003932044809783227

"Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data. The fruits of this research will assist our national initiatives to pave the way toward a safe and effective BioSecure biosurveillance solution. n/a",Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing,7790142,R01PH000022,[' '],PHPPO,MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2007,677278,0.0343757352904856
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,7075417,R01LM008635,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated medical record system', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'health science research', 'high throughput technology', 'human data']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,544814,0.04368250067801255
"Natural Language Processing for Respiratory Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in biomedical informatics research. She will dedicate her career to developing and evaluating methodologies for improving the processes and outcomes of healthcare using data locked in textual documents. This career development award will provide her with initial support for achieving her career goals.      The applicant has three goals for her career development over the next three years. First, she will compare the performance of different machine learning techniques at detecting patients with a respiratory syndrome. The proposed research will expand the state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance capabilities by integrating findings, symptoms, and diseases described in textual medical records. The product of the first research goal will be a model for respiratory syndromic case detection for monitoring natural and bioterrorism induced respiratory outbreaks. Second, she will apply existing methods and develop new techniques for extracting clinical conditions required for respiratory case detection from emergency department notes, contributing new knowledge to the medical language processing field using sentence and report level models that account for uncertainty, negation, and temporal occurrence. The product of the second goal will be a better understanding of the information required for accurate detection of respiratory related conditions from text and useful tools for automatically extracting that information. Third, she will teach, promote, and facilitate the use of natural language processing in the biomedical informatics field. The product of the third goal will be a graduate class surveying medical language processing methodology and applications and development of general tools sets for researchers who need encoded data from textual patient records.        The proposed research will focus on:   Aim 1. Development and evaluation of a respiratory case detection model;   Aim 2. Integration of existing natural language processing tools and development of new methodologies for extracting clinical conditions needed for respiratory case detection from textual records; and   Aim 3.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance.

"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,7110256,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,478733,0.09657357447322444

Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7083613,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,535569,0.04649878070445692
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,6899974,R01LM008635,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated medical record system', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'health science research', 'high throughput technology', 'human data']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,515359,0.04368250067801255
"Natural Language Processing for Respiratory Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in biomedical informatics research. She will dedicate her career to developing and evaluating methodologies for improving the processes and outcomes of healthcare using data locked in textual documents. This career development award will provide her with initial support for achieving her career goals.      The applicant has three goals for her career development over the next three years. First, she will compare the performance of different machine learning techniques at detecting patients with a respiratory syndrome. The proposed research will expand the state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance capabilities by integrating findings, symptoms, and diseases described in textual medical records.

"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6892934,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'health care facility information system', 'human data', 'information system analysis', 'method development', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,384538,0.04313599431714013
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,6948251,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer data analysis', 'computer graphics /printing', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'health care quality', 'health care referral /consultation', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'musculoskeletal disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'statistics /biometry', 'telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,399327,0.045515439343851605
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.

"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     An emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical informatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6836781,F38LM008478,"['bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'human data', 'library', 'mathematical model', 'public health', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2004,94545,0.07042285697469053

"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6802698,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'information systems', 'medical records', 'online computer', 'primary care physician', 'vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,437194,0.03413337060561909

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6749459,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,594553,0.04649878070445692
"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3).

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6630735,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', ' classification', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' method development', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,377617,0.04313599431714013
"Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research Medical errors hurt patients, cost money, and undermine the health care system. The first step to reducing errors is detecting them, for what cannot be detected cannot be managed. A number of approaches have been applied to medical error detection, including mandatory event reporting, voluntary near-miss reporting, chart review, and automated surveillance using information systems. Automated surveillance promises large-scale detection, minimal labor, and, potentially, detection in real time to prevent or recover from errors. Unfortunately, large amounts of important clinical information lie locked in narrative reports, unavailable to automated decision support systems. A number of tools have emerged from medical informatics and computer science- natural language processing, visualization tools, and machine learning- as well as methods for understanding cognitive processes. We hypothesize that the electronic medical record contains information useful for detecting errors and that natural language processing and other tools will allow us to retrieve the information. We will assemble a team skilled in natural language processing, data mining, terminology, patient safety research, and health care. We will use a clinical repository with ten years of data on two million patients. It includes administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy coded information as well as a wide range of narrative reports including discharge summaries, operative reports, outpatient notes, autopsy reports, resident signout notes, nursing notes, and reports from numerous ancillary services (radiology, pathology, etc.). We will apply a proven natural language processor called MedLEE to code the information and measure the accuracy of automated queries to detect and characterize errors. We will target several areas: explicit error reporting in the medical record, NYPORTS mandatory event reporting, clinical conflicts in record, and other sources of error information. We will use a systems approach to errors and cognitive analysis to uncover cues to improve error detection. We will incorporate the system into the hospital's current event surveillance program and assess the impact on error detection. We will adhere to strict privacy policies and security procedures.

"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6665504,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' online computer', ' primary care physician', ' vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,424735,0.03413337060561909
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,6725819,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer data analysis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health care quality', ' health care referral /consultation', ' human data', ' image enhancement', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' musculoskeletal disorder', ' nervous system disorder', ' statistics /biometry', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,383268,0.045515439343851605
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.

"UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                              The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP)        to help realize the full potential of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).           Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to: 1) extract and encode              information in textual reports; 2) map terms to an authoritative vocabulary;         3) obtain comprehensive domain coverage based on the processing of domain            corpora; and 4) facilitate vocabulary development by providing visualization         tools using the Extensible Markup Language (XML).  It has already been               demonstrated that MedLEE, the NLP system we developed, accurately extracts and       codifies information in the EMR.  This current project builds upon our               experience with MedLEE and uses it to accomplish the latter three goals              concerning vocabulary development and standardization.                                                                                                                    More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map source terms to UMLS concepts.         MedLEE will process and structure the source terms and candidate UMLS                concepts.  Suitable matches will be found based on structural similarity             between components of the source term and candidate concepts.  This should           enhance current methods because knowledge of the type of modifiers that match        should improve the quality of the matches.  We will also use MedLEE to process       a large corpus and generate structured output in XML format.  Statistics based       on the structured output will be computed, and then clinically relevant              composite terms will be detected based on frequencies of the structures              containing the more elementary terms.  Our method differs from other discovery       methods because we use NLP techniques that identify semantic modifiers and           complex relations even if the terms are distant from each other, whereas other       methods use statistical co-occurrence data based on adjacency.

"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images.

"Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research Medical errors hurt patients, cost money, and undermine the health care system. The first step to reducing errors is detecting them, for what cannot be detected cannot be managed. A number of approaches have been applied to medical error detection, including mandatory event reporting, voluntary near-miss reporting, chart review, and automated surveillance using information systems. Automated surveillance promises large-scale detection, minimal labor, and, potentially, detection in real time to prevent or recover from errors. Unfortunately, large amounts of important clinical information lie locked in narrative reports, unavailable to automated decision support systems. A number of tools have emerged from medical informatics and computer science- natural language processing, visualization tools, and machine learning- as well as methods for understanding cognitive processes. We hypothesize that the electronic medical record contains information useful for detecting errors and that natural language processing and other tools will allow us to retrieve the information. We will assemble a team skilled in natural language processing, data mining, terminology, patient safety research, and health care. We will use a clinical repository with ten years of data on two million patients. It includes administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy coded information as well as a wide range of narrative reports including discharge summaries, operative reports, outpatient notes, autopsy reports, resident signout notes, nursing notes, and reports from numerous ancillary services (radiology, pathology, etc.). We will apply a proven natural language processor called MedLEE to code the information and measure the accuracy of automated queries to detect and characterize errors. We will target several areas: explicit error reporting in the medical record, NYPORTS mandatory event reporting, clinical conflicts in record, and other sources of error information. We will use a systems approach to errors and cognitive analysis to uncover cues to improve error detection. We will incorporate the system into the hospital's current event surveillance program and assess the impact on error detection. We will adhere to strict privacy policies and security procedures. This project represents a unique opportunity to apply the most advanced medical language processing system to a large, comprehensive clinical repository to advance patient safety research.  n/a",Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research,6448720,R18HS011806,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health service demonstration project', ' human data', ' iatrogenic disease', ' patient care', ' patient safety /medical error']",AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R18,2001,356099,0.05449725258787259
"UNLOCKING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS WITH TEXT PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                              The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP)        to help realize the full potential of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).           Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to: 1) extract and encode              information in textual reports; 2) map terms to an authoritative vocabulary;         3) obtain comprehensive domain coverage based on the processing of domain            corpora; and 4) facilitate vocabulary development by providing visualization         tools using the Extensible Markup Language (XML).  It has already been               demonstrated that MedLEE, the NLP system we developed, accurately extracts and       codifies information in the EMR.  This current project builds upon our               experience with MedLEE and uses it to accomplish the latter three goals              concerning vocabulary development and standardization.                                                                                                                    More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map source terms to UMLS concepts.         MedLEE will process and structure the source terms and candidate UMLS                concepts.  Suitable matches will be found based on structural similarity             between components of the source term and candidate concepts.  This should           enhance current methods because knowledge of the type of modifiers that match        should improve the quality of the matches.  We will also use MedLEE to process       a large corpus and generate structured output in XML format.  Statistics based       on the structured output will be computed, and then clinically relevant              composite terms will be detected based on frequencies of the structures              containing the more elementary terms.  Our method differs from other discovery       methods because we use NLP techniques that identify semantic modifiers and           complex relations even if the terms are distant from each other, whereas other       methods use statistical co-occurrence data based on adjacency.

"A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In radiology practices, timely and accurate formulation of reports is closely linked to patient satisfaction, physician productivity, and reimbursement. While the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Soci- ety of North America have recommended implementation of structured reporting to facilitate clear and consistent communication between radiologists and referring clinicians, cumbersome nature of current structured reporting systems made them unpopular amongst their users. Recently, the emerging techniques of deep learning have been widely and successfully applied in many different natural language processing tasks (NLP). However, when adopted in a certain speciﬁc domain, such as radiology, these techniques should be combined with extensive domain knowledge to improve efﬁciency and accuracy. There is, therefore, a critical need to take advantage of clinical NLP and deep learning to fundamentally change the radiology reporting. The long-term goal in this appli- cation is to improve the form, content, and quality of radiology reports and to facilitate rapid generation of radiol- ogy reports with consistent organization and standardized texts. The overall objective is to use radiology-speciﬁc ontology, NLP and computer vision techniques, and deep learning to construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph, which will then be used to build a reporting system that can assist radiologists to quickly generate struc- tured and standardized text reports. The rationale for this project is that through integration of new clinical NLP technologies, radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graphs, and development of new reporting system, we can build au- tomatous systems with a higher-level understanding of the radiological world. The speciﬁc aims of this project are to: (1) recognize and normalize named entities in radiology reports; (2) construct a radiology-speciﬁc knowledge graph from free-text and images; and (3) build a reporting system that can dynamically adjust templates based on radiologists' prior entries. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it combines deep learning, NLP techniques, and domain knowledge in a single framework to construct comprehensive and accurate knowledge graphs that will enhance the workﬂow of the current reporting systems. The proposed research is signiﬁcant because a novel reporting system can expedite radiologists' workﬂow and acquire well-annotated datasets that facilitate machine learning and data science. To develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Yifan Peng, requires additional training and mentoring in clinical NLP and radiology. During the K99 phase, Dr. Peng will conduct this research as a research fellow at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. He will be mentored by Dr. Zhiyong Lu, a leading text mining and deep learning researcher, and co- mentored by Dr. Ronald M. Summers, a leading radiologist and clinical informatics researcher. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Peng to achieve the career goals of becoming an independent investigator and leader in the study of clinical NLP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it entails a new strategy to construct a radiology- speciﬁc knowledge graph to facilitate the development of a new reporting system that enables rapid generation of structured radiology reports. The proposed knowledge graph and reporting system will contribute to advancement in understanding of the radiological world, and promise to enhance clinical communication and patient-centric care. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission that pertains to applying deep knowledge of clinical terminology and natural language processing to improve clinical data science and health services.",A framework to enhance radiology structured report by invoking NLP and DL:  Models and Applications,10197509,R00LM013001,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'American College of Radiology', 'Award', 'Biotechnology', 'Caring', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Formulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Services', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nomenclature', 'North America', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resort', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge graph', 'lexical', 'long short term memory', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'repository', 'response', 'syntax', 'text searching']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R00,2020,236549,0.07362294427820919
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10011177,R44TR003254,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Belief', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Administration', 'International', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Operations Research', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Records', 'Research', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2020,503546,0.08991244882680376
"Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing Project Summary Automatic extraction of useful information from clinical texts enables new clinical research tasks and new technologies at the point of care. The natural language processing (NLP) systems that perform this extraction rely on supervised machine learning. The learning process uses manually labeled datasets that are limited in size and scope, and as a result, applying NLP systems to unseen datasets often results in severely degraded performance. Obtaining larger and broader datasets is unlikely due to the expense of the manual labeling process and the difficulty of sharing text data between multiple different institutions. Therefore, this project develops unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms to adapt NLP systems to new data. Domain adaptation describes the process of adapting a machine learning system to new data sources. The proposed methods are unsupervised in that they do not require manual labels for the new data. This project has three aims. The first aim makes use of multiple existing datasets for the same task to study the differences in domains, and uses this information to develop new domain adaptation algorithms. Evaluation uses standard machine learning metrics, and analysis of performance is tightly bounded by strong baselines from below and realistic upper bounds, both based on theoretical research on machine learning generalization. The second aim develops open source software tools to simplify the process of incorporating domain adaptation into clinical text processing workflows. This software will have input interfaces to connect to methods developed in Aim 1 and output interfaces to connect with Apache cTAKES, a widely used open- source NLP tool. Aim 3 tests these methods in an end-to-end use case, adverse drug event (ADE) extraction on a dataset of pediatric pulmonary hypertension notes. ADE extraction relies on multiple NLP systems, so this use case is able to show how broad improvements to NLP methods can improve downstream methods. This aim also creates new manual labels for the dataset for an end-to-end evaluation that directly measures how improvements to the NLP systems lead to improvement in ADE extraction. Project Narrative Software systems that use machine learning to understand clinical text often suffer severe performance loss when they are applied to new data that looks different than the data that they originally learned from. In this project, we develop and implement methods that allow these systems to automatically adapt to the characteristics of a new data source. We evaluate these methods on the clinical research task of adverse drug event detection, which relies on many different variables found in the text of electronic health records.",Automated domain adaptation for clinical natural language processing,9986899,R01LM012918,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'case finding', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'news', 'novel', 'open source', 'point of care', 'side effect', 'social media', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,383874,0.09231618650140971
"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naïve and mature screening program. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients,10026785,R01DA051464,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Social Work', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Substance Abuse Detection', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening program', 'substance misuse', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,663889,-0.04507757485470849
"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,9998610,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'adverse event risk', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'care coordination', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'financial incentive', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'structured data', 'success', 'testing services', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,855710,0.04130949146635951

"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions). NARRATIVE This project is interested in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for better understanding the spatial relationships described in the free text data within radiology reports found in electronic health record (EHR) systems. We will (i) develop an ontology, (ii) manually create a dataset for training NLP methods, (iii) develop automatic NLP methods compatible the ontology and corpus, and (iv) evaluate automatic image classification methods that use the output of the NLP system as image labels.",Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports,9957898,R21EB029575,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Encephalomalacia', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hemosiderin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Linguistics', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Trust', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'deep learning', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'lateral ventricle', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'radiological imaging', 'scale up', 'spatial relationship', 'structured data', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2020,271250,0.05526218052045532

"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales.

"Open Health Natural Language Processing Collaboratory Project Summary One of the major barriers in leveraging Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for clinical and translational science is the prevalent use of unstructured or semi-structured clinical narratives for documenting clinical information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which extracts structured information from narratives, has received great attention and has played a critical role in enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. As demonstrated by large scale efforts such as ACT (Accrual of patients for Clinical Trials), eMERGE, and PCORnet, using EHR data for research rests on the capabilities of a robust data and informatics infrastructure that allows the structuring of clinical narratives and supports the extraction of clinical information for downstream applications. Current successful NLP use cases often require a strong informatics team (with NLP experts) to work with clinicians to supply their domain knowledge and build customized NLP engines iteratively. This requires close collaboration between NLP experts and clinicians, not feasible at institutions with limited informatics support. Additionally, the usability, portability, and generalizability of the NLP systems are still limited, partially due to the lack of access to EHRs across institutions to train the systems. The limited availability of EHR data limits the training available to improve the workforce competence in clinical NLP. We aim to address the above challenges by extending our existing collaboration among multiple CTSA hubs on open health natural language processing (OHNLP) to share distributional information of NLP artifacts (i.e., words, n-grams, phrases, sentences, concept mentions, concepts, and text segments) acquired from real EHRs across multiple institutions. We will leverage the advanced privacy-preserving computing infrastructure of iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring) for privacy- preserving data analysis models and will partner with diverse communities including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), PCORnet, and Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) to demonstrate the utility of NLP for translational research. This CTSA innovation award RFA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced with clinical NLP and through strong partnership with multiple research communities and leadership roles of the research team in clinical NLP, we envision that the successful delivery of this project will broaden the utilization of clinical NLP across the research community. There are four aims planned: i) obtain PHI-suppressed NLP artifacts with retained distribution information across multiple institutions and assess the privacy risk of accessing PHI- suppressed artifacts, ii) generate a synthetic text corpus for exploratory analysis of clinical narratives and assess its utility in NLP tasks leveraging various NLP challenges, iii) develop privacy-preserving computational phenotyping models empowered with NLP, and iv) partner with diverse communities to demonstrate the utility of our project for translational research.

"Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models PROJECT SUMMARY  Racial-ethnic minorities (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals experience high levels of psychological distress. Psychological treatments can be effective in addressing mental health concerns, but disparities in quality of care still exist. Although systemic and institutional factors contribute to disparities in care, mental health providers are also critical to examine. A primary focus of efforts to understand and reduce provider contributions to mental health care disparities has been to examine cultural competency (CC), which involves a provider’s ability to navigate the cultural aspects of clinical interactions. Patient ratings of CC are generally associated with treatment outcomes and therapeutic processes. While patient perceptions of provider CC are important, a reliance on retrospective patient ratings limits what we know about how cultural identities are discussed, and the language that constitutes culturally sensitive care. Many studies of provider CC also require observers or patients to make complex judgments based on internal provider characteristics that are not reliably observable (e.g. rate provider awareness of their own cultural values). More studies are needed that examine patient-provider interactions in treatment in order to assess the impact of specific provider behaviors, and how they relate to perceptions of provider CC. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been applied to psychotherapy conversations to automatically capture the use of evidence based treatments, topics of conversation, empathy, and emotional expression. Prior research demonstrating the feasibility of automatically identifying topics of conversation in psychotherapy suggest that NLP models could be trained to automatically identify specific moments in sessions where patients and providers are talking about cultural issues. NLP models could allow researchers to not only examine how specific patterns of provider-patient interactions drive CC, but might also provide rapid feedback to providers, and in turn help address disparities in care. The purpose of the current study is to do the foundational work to develop and evaluate NLP tools that capture the cultural content of provider-patient interactions among REM and LGBTQ patients. First, utilizing 32,436 labeled talk turns from 200 psychotherapy sessions we will evaluate the accuracy of NLP models in recognizing the discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy. Second, we will use NLP models to explore differences in the content of 1,235 psychotherapy sessions that were rated as highly positive or negative on a measure of cultural competence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although disparities in the quality of mental health treatment for racial-ethnic minority (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) patients are well known, to date there are no tools that can identify specific patterns of provider-patient interactions that drive disparities in care. This project will evaluate the ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to recognize discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy among REM and LGBTQ patients, and explore differences in patient-provider interactions with low and high patient ratings of provider cultural competency.",Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models,9906653,F31MD014941,"['Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Discrimination', 'Empathy', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Suicide', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'community setting', 'cultural competence', 'cultural values', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'improved', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'racial and ethnic', 'sexual identity', 'showing emotion', 'substance abuse treatment', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'university student', 'willingness']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F31,2020,45016,0.05632284267377467
"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10056750,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2020,260660,0.026812308262268006
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); In recent years, there has been increasing evidence supporting the role of DSs in ADRD in preventing cognitive impairment but there is limited evidence and the sample sizes have been small. Real- world data (RWD) especially the EHR contain detailed treatment and response information from patients and could be used to detect the usage and effect of DSs, DSIs, which is more translational to clinical outcomes (e.g., MCI to ADRD conversion). To the best of our knowledge, there is no investigation on DSs usage and safety among patients in MCI and ADRD using EHR data. Our current parent award is focusing on the development of a translational informatics framework to enable the discovery of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) by linking scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. To response to NOT-AG-20-008, this administrative supplement application will complement our parent award in multiple aspects: (1) developing novel and advanced data analytic methods for mining RWD in EHR, (2) identifying DSs usage information among patients with ADRD, and (3) detecting safety and effect of DS among patients with ADRD from existing EHR data. In our preliminary work, we have investigated the methods to identify DSs terms on EHR and developed natural language processing (NLP) methods to identify use status of DSs. We will further our efforts to collect a EHR dataset with DSs usage and AE-DSs signals from AD patients and develop innovative informatics methods to extract such information. Our specific aims are: (1) identifying DSs usage among patients with MCI and ADRD from existing EHR data; and (2) detecting the DSs safety signals and exploring the effect of DSs use on the conversion from MCI to ADRD from existing EHR data. The successful completion of this project will stimulate our further investigation on the role of DS use in patients with ADRD in a larger scale involving EHR data from other healthcare institutions. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this administrative supplement application, we will evaluate the usage and safety of dietary supplements (DSs) usage in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), respectively using electronic health records (EHR) data. We will also explore the feasibility of using EHR to detect DS effect on the conversion from MCI to ADRD. This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in DSs and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice. The successful accomplishment of this supplement project will deliver a novel informatics methods and generate DSI signals among patients with ADRD. This project will stimulate our further investigation on the role of DS use in patients with ADRD in a larger scale involving EHR data from other healthcare institutions.",An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions,10119590,R01AT009457,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'Investigation', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Records', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surveys', 'Terminology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'dietary supplements', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prevent', 'response', 'treatment response']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,339298,0.0201978665106007
"National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives Project Summary and Abstract Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Natural language processing (NLP) technologies can extract this information and convert it in to a structured format that is more readily accessible by computerized systems. However, the development of NLP systems is contingent on access to relevant data and EHRs are notoriously difficult to obtain because of privacy reasons. Despite the recent efforts to de-identify and release narrative EHRs for research, these data are still very rare. As a result, clinical NLP, as a field has lagged behind. To address this problem, since 2006, we organized thirteen shared tasks, accompanied with workshops and journal publications. Twelve of these shared tasks have focused on the development of clinical NLP systems and the remaining one on the usability of these systems. We have covered both depth and breadth in terms of shared tasks, preparing tasks that study cutting-edge NLP problems on a variety of EHR data from multiple institutions. Our shared tasks are the longest running series of clinical NLP shared tasks, with ever growing EHR data sets, tasks, and participation. Our most popular three data sets have been cited 495 (2010 data), 284 (2006 de-id data), and 274 (2009 data) times, respectively, representing hundreds of articles that have come out of these three data sets alone. Our goal in this proposal is to continue the efforts we started in 2006 under i2b2 shared task challenges (i2b2, NIH NLM U54LM008748, PI: Kohane and R13 LM011411, PI: Uzuner) to de-identify EHRs, annotate them with gold- standard annotations for clinical NLP tasks, and release them to the research community for the development and head-to-head comparison of clinical NLP systems, for the advancement of the state of the art. Continuing our efforts under National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) based at the Health Data Science program of the newly established Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, we aim to form partnerships with the community to grow the shared task efforts in several ways: (1) grow the available de-identified EHR data sets through partnerships that can contribute to the volume and variety of the data, and (2) grow the available gold-standard annotations in terms of depth and breadth of NLP tasks. Given these aims and partnerships, we plan to hold a series of shared tasks. We will complement these shared tasks with workshops that meet in conjunction with the Fall Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association and with journal special issues so that advancement of the state of the art can be sped up and future generations can build on the past. Project Narrative We propose to organize a series of shared tasks, workshops, and journal publications for fostering the continuous development of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that can extract information from narratives of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our aim is to grow the annotated gold standard EHR data sets that are available to the research community through partnerships and to bring together clinical NLP researchers with informatics researchers for building collaborations. We will engage the community in shared tasks and disseminate the knowledge generated by these shared tasks through workshops and journal special issues for the advancement of the state of the art.",National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,9930152,R13LM013127,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Future Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical development', 'computerized', 'falls', 'head-to-head comparison', 'health data', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'practical application', 'programs', 'symposium', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R13,2020,20000,0.09025049072363889
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9852435,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'smoking cessation', 'structured data', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vape pens']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2020,76250,0.050613251104890254
"Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool Existing methods for surveillance of patient harm in the ED setting are inadequate, without any meaningful change in decades. Trigger tools, popularized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool, have been developed for multiple clinical areas and are used across the world, outperform traditional approaches for surveillance of adverse events. These tools use a two-tiered review process where a nurse screens records for triggers (predefined findings that make the presence of an AE more likely) and reviews records with triggers for AEs, discarding those without triggers. We developed a consensus-based ED trigger tool (EDTT) using a multicenter, transdisciplinary modified Delphi approach, subsequently pilot testing this in a multicenter fashion with encouraging results. This was followed by a recently completed, AHRQ-funded single center study to automate, refine and validate this tool. This study demonstrated that the EDTT is a high-yield and efficient instrument for identifying adverse events in the ED. The present study will evaluate the refined, automated EDTT), in a multicenter study. We will evaluate the EDTT’s generalizability and robustness at three sites with large emergency departments, with a planned in-depth review of 9,000 ED admissions. We will use natural language processing of electronic medical record narratives and machine learning to improve the EDTT efficiency in trigger detection and AE discovery. We will establish the basis for a wider use and prepare for scalability and usability of the tool, creating standardized, streamlined and free online training materials, and by evaluating the tool in a real-world manner consistent with intended use. Project Narrative Commonly used approaches in Emergency Departments to detect adverse events are low yield and have not changed in decades, providing inadequate surveillance for patient harm. The need for improved methodology is critical, given the evolving role of the emergency department in the health care system. Trigger tools, developed for use in many healthcare settings across the world, detect all-cause harm, helping direct resources by identifying areas of risk and allowing an assessment of the effectiveness of quality improvement efforts over time. Trigger tools involve screening of records by a nurse for triggers (findings that make an adverse event more likely) and a review of only records with triggers searching for adverse events. Any events identified undergo confirmatory physician review. We developed a trigger tool for the ED, applying rigorous methods to identify predictive triggers, to computerize the screen for triggers eliminating manual review and improving record selection to enhance yield and efficiency. This tool demonstrates superior performance for detecting adverse events. We will now test this tool in a multicenter project to evaluate its broad application, confirming its utility and to continue to improve its yield and efficiency in adverse event detection by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques.",Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool,10098792,R01HS027811,[' '],AHRQ,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,398528,0.024693718725659602
"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals.

"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format with tremendous potential but an equally large concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potential for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary use of clinical data and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious and costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for higher accuracy and much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to advance a text de-identification system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the research infrastructure at our implementation and testing site (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC), and ready for commercialization efforts. To accomplish this undertaking, we will focus on the following specific aims and related objectives, while continuing to prepare the commercialization of the integrated system, with detailed market analysis, commercial roadmap development, and modern media communication: 1) Enhance the text de-identification system performance, scalability, and quality to produce an enterprise-grade solution ready for deployment; 2) Enable use of structured data for enhanced text de-identification (when structured PII is available) and for complete patient records de-identification (i.e., records combining structured and unstructured data). This aim also includes implementing “one-way” pseudo-identifier cryptographic hashing to enable securely linking already de-identified patient records; 3) Integrate the text de-identification system with a research data capture and management system. This includes implementation of the de-identification system as a secure web service, with standards-based access and integration. This de-identification system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will ease research data sharing (as expected for larger NIH-funded research projects) and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality. Significant time-savings will also be offered, with a process at least 200-1000 times faster than manual de-identification. The adoption of Electronic Health Record systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format, with tremendous potential, but also equally growing concern for patient confidentiality breaches.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9880374,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,592632,0.07258609500897269
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9994228,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data harmonization', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2020,618291,0.012949020320583553
"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community. The results of this investigation will also provide contemporary insights on how patients who experience heart attacks in the community are treated by physicians.",Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease,9838247,R01HL135219,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Hospital Administration', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Inpatients', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Reperfusion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Practice Management', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rural', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'hospital readmission', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient health information', 'population based', 'prevent', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'surveillance data', 'treatment guidelines', 'trend']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,768763,0.06775597166173966
