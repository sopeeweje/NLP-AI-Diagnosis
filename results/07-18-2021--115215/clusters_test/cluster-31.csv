"Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression PROJECT SUMMARY Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. Seizure generalization appears to be critical for successful antidepressant response to ECT, and stimulation dose is adjusted to ensure an “adequate” seizure. Previous studies have linked seizure generalization during ECT with thalamocortical regions, and our own MRI studies indicate that thalamocortical networks exhibit neuroplasticity after treatment in patients who respond to ECT. Yet, despite recent growth in the number of MRI studies measuring long-term neuroplasticity across ECT sessions, relatively less is known about the neurobiology of seizure activity elicited during each session. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand how ECT-induced seizures change brain networks to treat depression. To address this goal, we will take a data-driven, machine learning approach to pre-existing ECT-MRI datasets of patients with depression, to identify the neurobiological features measured with MRI (functional connectivity, gray-matter morphometry, electric fields) that optimally explain inter-patient variability in seizure indicators (seizure duration and stimulation dose). Aim 1 will identify biomarkers of susceptibility to ECT-induced seizures by analyzing pre-treatment MRI with respect to initial stimulation dose and seizure duration. Aim 2 studies will determine how brain network plasticity over the course of ECT relates to changes in stimulation dose and duration of ECT-induced seizures. These studies will further our understanding of therapeutic seizures in ECT, potentially facilitating prediction of optimal dose and/or treatment outcome to improve ECT and minimize side effects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. The proposed studies target characteristics of therapeutic seizures elicited during ECT (seizure duration, stimulation dose) and their relationship to pre-treatment and post-treatment neurobiology measured with pre- existing MRI datasets.",Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression,10069399,R03MH121769,"['Ache', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disorientation', 'Dose', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Muscle relaxants', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'interpatient variability', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'motor symptom', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'sex', 'side effect', 'social stigma', 'vector']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,79417
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device.

"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,10179293,R01AG064233,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'follow-up', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'in vivo', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'recruit', 'religious order study', 'response']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,663226
"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists. Project Narrative For FDG PET imaging, we propose to develop a novel and simple approach of quantifying tumor Ki and generating parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual-time- point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology.",Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans,10117077,R03EB027864,"['Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiolabeled', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'population based', 'research study', 'simulation', 'success', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,83750
"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in six deaths. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for comprehensive evaluation of CAD, but its clinical translation is hampered by lengthy exam times. In this work, we will develop and validate techniques for rapid cardiac MRI in a short exam time for comprehensive CAD assessment.",Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease,10171902,R01HL153146,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Back', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Gadolinium', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease diagnosis', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,487354
"Low-Field High-Performance MRI for Screening Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and is the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related mortality in males in the United States. Despite high incidence and tremendous human and economic impact of PCa, there is no good screening test for clinically significant PCa. Commonly used blood test for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is inexpensive but lack specificity for clinically significant PCa. Over the last decade, multi- parametric prostate MRI has been shown to have an increasingly important role in the detection and localization of clinically significant PCa. Despite the demonstrated value of prostate MRI, there are two major challenges in clinical implementation of prostate MRI as a first-line screening tool at a population level: (1) high cost of the scanner and the exam, which decreases accessibility, and (2) lack of robustness of the MRI exam. To overcome these limitations we propose establishing a low-field, robust, widely accessible, and thus low- cost high-performance MRI system for PCa screening. Major challenges for imaging at lower field strength is the lower signal to noise (SNR) and thus longer acquisition times compared to 1.5 and 3.0 T. In this proposal we aim to address these efficiency and scan time challenges at low field. Our team of clinical and imaging scientists will bring to bear novel acquisition and reconstruction techniques to restore SNR, specifically random matrix theory (RMT- a technique our center has recently introduced), and deep-learning- based image reconstruction (an area our group has helped to pioneer). We will evaluate these techniques in healthy volunteers and patients with PCa. Subsequently, we will perform head-to-head comparison of low-field bi-parametric exam to routine clinical 1.5 T or 3.0 T MRI exams in 30 patients with known or suspected PCa. Project Narrative Although Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer- related mortality in men in the U.S., there is a lack of a good screening test for clinically significant PCa. Multi- parametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in detecting and localizing clinically significant PCa, but cost and accessibility of conventional MRI limits its use as a first-line screening test. Therefore, we propose establishing a low-field, robust, accessible, and thus low-cost, high- performance MRI methodology for screening clinically significant PCa.",Low-Field High-Performance MRI for Screening Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer,10111669,R21CA256324,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'American Cancer Society', 'Amplifiers', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Helium', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Intestines', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Ownership', 'PSA screening', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ursidae Family', 'aged', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinically significant', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'design', 'economic impact', 'head-to-head comparison', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'prostate lesions', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'theories', 'volunteer']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,237724
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10187567,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2021,310796
"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of target and OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi-organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will develop an MT-MR simulation based multi-organ auto- segmentation tool. In Aim 3, we will optimize a deep learning-based dose prediction model and assess the effectiveness of the MT-MR based RTP workflow in adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy planning of pancreatic cancer patients. Successful completion of the project will significantly promote the clinical adoption of MR simulation for abdominal RTP, which will improve treatment precision and outcomes. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in both cancer diagnosis and radiotherapy. Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi- organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10331615,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Water', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pancreatic cancer patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,507076
"Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam Abstract Non-invasive, multi-parametric characterization of prostate cancer (PC), with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, is an active area of research with great potential for providing improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The PI-RADSv2 assessment system that was established by an international team of experts recognizes the value of quantitative images in PC diagnosis, but relies largely on qualitative evaluation of weighted images. Although this grading approach achieves reasonably good separation be- tween normal and abnormal prostate tissue, it does not achieve adequate separation between indolent and aggressive disease, with the risk that more unnecessary and costly surgery is performed with poten- tially dire consequences on patient quality of life. High-value protocols, without need for an invasive and costly endo-rectal radio-frequency coil are being investigated. This comes at the cost of extended scan time and reduced image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and signal bias, which negatively impacts sensitivity and speciﬁcity of multi-parametric MRI. With the pronounced increase of multi-parametric MRI exams, there is also the desire to integrate the support by the most recent revolution in diagnostic imaging, i.e., machine learning. It becomes increasingly clear, that in order to avoid having to train neural networks for each speciﬁc system and protocol, reproducible and thus preferably quantitative imaging protocols are essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose both pulse sequence develop- ment, investigation of ADC validity and reproducibility and novel post-processing strategies. The overall objective is to demonstrate the added value of lesion characterization with quantitative values and at the same time understand and minimize the inﬂuence of protocol choices and scan hardware, hence improve overall reproducibility. Speciﬁc Aim 1 will focus on the development of a low distortion MR imaging sequence for rapid concurrent quantiﬁcation of T2 and diﬀusion signal decay. Speciﬁc Aim 2 will examine ADC variations that result from changes in diﬀusion time over a range that is typical with present day clinical MR systems. Speciﬁc Aim 3 introduces advanced handling of low noise diﬀusion data, which will be indispensable for achieving high accuracy and precision with non-invasive and economic external coils. Speciﬁc Aim 4 introduces a novel ADC computation approach that fully captures the complex diﬀusion signal decays in tissues and at the same time is largely protocol and system independent. Moreover, re- sulting images and quantitative maps processed according this approach, exhibit considerably lower noise, which can be traded for higher spatial resolution or shorter scan duration. In combination, the consis- tently quantitative nature of the data and its ubiquitous validity and comparability will greatly facilitate the establishment of recommendations for disease-related thresholds. Ultimately this may permit much more reliable diﬀerentiation of aggressive from indolent disease. Project Narrative Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role for staging of prostate cancer. We propose advances that permit quantitative and a more reliable assessment of prostate cancer. Potentially this will permit better diﬀerentiation of disease that is aggressive from disease that poses low risk of spreading.",Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam,10115670,R01CA241817,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'cancer diagnosis', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'method development', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'rectal']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,452748
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,10202485,R01AR074492,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Canes', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait rehabilitation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'kinetic model', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,425647
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10220967,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2021,821583
"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10217254,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,760832
"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions.

"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,10158473,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2021,227282
"Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers PROJECT SUMMARY  Gynecologic cancers are some of the most lethal diseases affecting women. Globally, one woman dies of cervical cancer every two minutes. MRI is increasingly used in the evaluation of gynecologic and many other cancers. Beyond its established use for cancer staging, there has long been an interest in the use of MRI-derived quantitative metrics to gain insights into the tumor microenvironment. Parametric maps obtained from quantification of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI data can be used to study tumor vascularity and identify tumors that are better perfused and oxygenated and thus more sensitive to some treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. However, the relative slow imaging speed and motion sensitivity of current MRI technology results in non-reliable and non-reproducible quantification of DCE-MRI data, which restricts its application in clinical practice.  Our group is a world leader in development of rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI techniques, in particular using combinations of radial imaging and compressed sensing. We developed the technique called GRASP, which was conceived as an academic-industrial partnership and has now been successfully translated into standard clinical practice. Though powerful, the first generation of GRASP has limitations. First, radial imaging is robust to motion, but not free of motion, which usually results in blurring. Second, GRASP uses a very simple sparsifying transform for compressed sensing, which can introduce issues with quantification. Third, GRASP was not originally developed for pharmacokinetic analysis and misses important ingredients such as integration of AIF estimation and T1 mapping. Fourth, image reconstruction time is still very long – in the order of several minutes.  We have developed new advances to circumvent these limitations and offer a new DCE-MRI technique with increased speed, motion-resistance and personalized AIF estimation and T1 mapping for pharmacokinetic analysis. Following the PAR-18-009 guidelines, our main goal is to form an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to translate these new developments in quantitative DCE-MRI for use in patients with gynecologic and other type of cancers. Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Develop and implement a fast motion-resistant quantitative DCE-MRI technique that goes beyond GRASP  to offer increased speed and resistance to motion; dynamic T1 mapping; and personalized and automated  pharmacokinetic analysis 2. Evaluate the repeatability, reproducibility and preliminary tumor response assessment of the fast motion-  robust quantitative DCE-MRI technique (“DCE-new”) and compare DCE-new to standard of care DCE-MRI  (“DCE-standard”) in patients with gynecologic cancer 3. Develop and evaluate fast image reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to establish an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to develop and disseminate advances in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI for use in cancer patients. The new developments, which include radial imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning, will deliver rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI with high spatial and temporal resolution for more accurate and reproducible quantification of MRI-derived metrics. The new technology to be disseminated as a prototype on GE scanners will promote the use of quantitative DCE-MRI biomarkers in clinical practice, a long-desired goal.",Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers,10267713,R01CA244532,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Early treatment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Radial', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Speed', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motion sensitivity', 'new technology', 'novel', 'population based', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,568123
"Rapid Motion-Robust and Easy-to-Use Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Liver Perfusion Quantification Project Summary The broad objective of this application is to develop a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification and to evaluate its performance in quantitative assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent primary malignancy in the liver. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) using gadolinium-based contrast agents is currently a cornerstone for identifying and characterizing hepatic lesions, including HCC. However, the current clinical use of liver DCE-MRI is limited to visual assessment of the pattern of perfusion in 3-4 multiphasic images (arterial, venous and delayed phases), and these images are routinely acquired during multiple breath holds. DCE-MRI also has the potential for quantitative assessment of perfusion kinetics, which can provide a deeper insight into the tumor microenvironment for non-invasive characterization of different histological features of the tumor, such as tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness. This is particularly relevant for HCC, which is typically diagnosed based on imaging without pathological confirmation from invasive biopsy. Unfortunately, conventional liver perfusion MRI techniques suffer from a number of important limitations that restrict its clinical implementation, including (1) slow imaging speed, (2) limited spatiotemporal resolution, (3) sensitivity to motion artifacts, and (4) time-consuming quantitative perfusion analysis. Meanwhile, the need for pre-contrast T1 mapping to convert MR signal to gadolinium concentration further complicates the already-cumbersome imaging workflow. These challenges and underlying complexity have all led to non-reproducible performance of liver perfusion MRI and have significantly diminished its ultimate clinical utility. In this project, we propose to develop new rapid MRI techniques combining novel motion-robust sampling strategies and advanced reconstruction models to address these challenges. The new imaging techniques will enable motion-robust 3D T1 mapping with whole-liver coverage for efficient estimation of contrast concentration and free-breathing DCE-MRI of the liver with high spatiotemporal resolution. We will also incorporate state-of-the-art methods in deep learning to further improve imaging performance, to reduce reconstruction time, and to substantially simplify perfusion quantification. These new technical developments will be integrated into a new liver perfusion MRI framework, which will be translated into the clinical setting for assessment of HCC in an exploratory clinical study. The overall hypothesis is that with the new imaging framework developed in the project, robust high spatiotemporal resolution perfusion MRI of the liver can be achieved under free breathing, and absolute quantification of liver perfusion can be performed without user- interaction. Given the rapidly rising incidence and substantial burden of HCC in the United States, successful completion of this project would enable significant progress towards improved characterization and management of HCC and other liver diseases with high clinical impact. Project Narrative The objective of this application is to develop and evaluate a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification. This new imaging framework is expected to promote the utilization, efficacy and clinical translation of liver perfusion MRI for improved management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other diseases of high clinical impact.",Rapid Motion-Robust and Easy-to-Use Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Liver Perfusion Quantification,10297597,R01EB030549,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Biopsy', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gadolinium', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver Dysfunction', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Burden', 'United States', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer type', 'care costs', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'contrast enhanced', 'curative treatments', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'feasibility testing', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'interest', 'liver imaging', 'mortality', 'motion sensitivity', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'routine imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NIBIB,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,464700
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,10117035,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,709759
"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,10150846,R01EB028590,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Iodine', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stents', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'calcification', 'clinically significant', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'photon-counting detector', 'routine practice', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'societal costs', 'spectral energy', 'spectrograph', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'vasa vasorum']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,657862
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers ABSTRACT  Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. These patients typically are socioeconomically disadvantaged, with poor access to screening and vaccination. Consequently, they often present with locoregionally advanced disease, for which pelvic radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin (i.e., chemoradiotherapy) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of treatment failure. Intensifying treatment through the delivery of chemotherapy doublets, either concurrently or as adjuvant therapy following chemoradiotherapy, is a promising strategy to improve outcomes. However, the delivery of intensive chemotherapy is complicated by high rates of gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoradiotherapy are needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue including bowel, bone marrow, bone, bladder, and rectum, leading to preventable radiation-induced toxicity. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can improve target localization and dosimetry, optimizing target dose while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. However, IGRT can be highly resource intensive, and comparative effectiveness trials have been lacking. For this reason, there is considerable controversy as to the utility of IG-IMRT in this disease. Our research group has been at the forefront of developing novel, cost-effective IGRT approaches with wide potential to facilitate better delivery of concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.  Previously we have found that radiation-induced injury to hematopoietically active bone marrow is a critical determinant of tolerance to intensive chemotherapy. Using machine learning methods, we recently developed a multi-atlas-based IGRT method that can predict canonical distributions of active bone marrow, which can obviate the need for positron emission tomography (PET) in settings where this technology is unavailable or unaffordable. The proposed new research will study the ability of multi-atlas-based IGRT to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to standard treatment, using data from 450 patients enrolled to a randomized phase III trial (NRG-GY006). Furthermore, we will use serial whole body PET/CT to study the impact of radiation dose and chemotherapy intensity on the compensatory hematopoietic response, and have developed novel whole body radiomics biomarkers to quantify the inflammatory state, which we hypothesize can influence patients' outcomes and tolerance to chemotherapy.  The new research extends our work associated with a current R01 grant (1R01CA197059-01) to conduct correlative science associated with the GY006 trial. The overarching goal of this research line is to augment the therapeutic ratio of chemoradiotherapy for pelvic cancers using advanced image-guided radiation techniques. If successful, this research would significantly alter the approach to the treatment of many pelvic malignancies for which chemoradiotherapy is standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we will test the ability of a novel method called multi-atlas-based image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to reduce acute hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to conventional RT, which could obviate the need for expensive functional imaging in socioeconomically disadvantaged and resource constrained populations, such as patients with gynecologic cancers. In addition, we will use serial positron emission tomography to study effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the subacute compensatory hematopoietic response, and will seek to develop and validate novel whole body radiomics models of the inflammatory state as predictive biomarkers for gynecologic cancers. We are in an optimal situation to conduct impactful and innovative research in the context of an ongoing phase III cooperative group randomized registration trial (NRG GY006), affording us the opportunity to conduct rigorous correlative science on a large sample with high data quality, quality assurance, and carefully controlled treatment effects.",Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers,10108128,R01CA255780,"['Acute', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Cisplatin', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intestines', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Cancer', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data quality', 'dosimetry', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'quality assurance', 'radiation-induced injury', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,276286
"Next-generation in-vivo fetal neuroimaging Next-Generation In-Vivo Fetal Neuroimaging The overall objective of this project is to dramatically improve fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to advance research in early human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders, the burden of which is, unfortunately, high because of their life-long impact and high prevalence. Fetal MRI has been the technique of choice in studying prenatal brain development. Fetal motion, however, makes MRI slice acquisition unreliable at best, as the fetus frequently moves while the prescribed slices are imaged. Uncompensated fetal motion disrupts 3D coverage of the anatomy and reduces the spatial resolution of slice-to-volume reconstructions. Repeating the scans does not ensure full 3D coverage of the anatomy, but increases total acquisition time. This, in turn, dramatically reduces the success rate and reliability of fetal MRI in studying the development of transient fetal brain compartments that are selectively sensitive to injury over the course of fetal development. To mitigate these issues and improve fetal MRI, we propose to automatically measure fetal brain position and prospectively navigate slices to each new position in real-time. The impact of this approach will be to dramatically increase the success rate and spatial resolution of fetal MRI for the in-vivo investigation of developing brain compartments, while, in parallel, reducing scan time, effectively making fetal MRI less burdensome for the mother, more accurate, and cost effective. By eliminating the manual re- adjustment of stack-of-slice positions, the time that elapses between scans will be virtually continuous. Our proposed technique will also make fetal MRI less operator-dependent and thus, more reproducible across sites, which is essential to conducting multi-center studies and clinical trials. Prospective navigation of fetal MRI slices to compensate for motion requires the development of novel, real-time image processing algorithms to recognize the fetal brain and its position and orientation; to track fetal motion to steer slices; and to detect and re-acquire motion corrupted slices. In this project, we will develop innovative deep learning models to process fetal MRI slices in real-time; will translate those models into an integrated system to prospectively navigate fetal MRI slices; and will validate the system on fetuses scanned at various gestational ages. To assess the utility and impact of the proposed technology, we will measure subplate volume in fetuses. The four specific aims of this study are to 1) assess fetal MRI via variable density image acquisition and reconstruction; 2) achieve real-time recognition of the fetal brain in MRI slices; 3) develop a system of real-time fetal head motion tracking and steering of slices; and 4) measure the subplate volume in the developing fetal brain using MRI. These aims will collectively translate and validate new imaging and image processing techniques to advance fetal MRI, and effectively eliminate a critical barrier to making progress in the fields of developmental neurology and neuroscience. Project Narrative: The proposed research aims to develop, translate, and validate innovative in-vivo imaging technologies to improve imaging and studying the development of the human fetal brain before birth. The technology will enable and improve studies on the development of the brain in fetuses with congenital disorders or fetuses at risk of having neurodevelopmental issues later in life. This in-turn is expected to result in timely and more effective treatments and therapeutic interventions that will lead to vastly improved patient outcomes in both the short- and long-term, effectively reducing the burden of human disabilities arising from congenital disorders.",Next-generation in-vivo fetal neuroimaging,10280126,R01EB031849,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Congenital Disorders', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Head', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Live Birth', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uterus', 'absorption', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive disability', 'congenital heart disorder', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'fetal', 'fetus at risk', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'migration', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'real-time images', 'reconstruction', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'virtual']",NIBIB,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,588593
"Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Skeletal Biomechanics Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease that causes joint degeneration, affects 27 million U.S. adults, and often leads to severe disability. The prevalence of OA is 33.6% in adults older than 65 years. Despite the fact that OA is a widespread and debilitating disease, treatment options are currently extremely limited, and established disease-modifying therapies do not exist. The solution generally offered to treat late stage, symptomatic knee OA is joint replacement (total knee/hip arthroplasty, TKA/THA), and while this surgically invasive and expensive remedy offers temporary relief, replacements often fail after 10-15 years, with shorter life spans in obese individuals. In order to reduce the number of TKA/THA procedures, preventive efforts and interventions targeting early stage OA are essential – the first step would be identifying subjects at high risk for disease development, at a stage when tissue is not yet lost, and cartilage matrix abnormalities are potentially reversible. Understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA.  Hip OA progression marked by changes in cartilage biochemistry has complex multi-joint interactions with several mechanistic factors, including morphological features, gait biomechanics and demographics. However, studies to date have mostly focused on the relationship between single mechanistic factors and semi-quantitative/ quantitative imaging measures, gait biomechanics, or non-objective symptomatic evidence of hip OA. The overall goal of this competitive renewal is to extend our longitudinal work to determine the structure-function-connectivity and mechanistic factors that mediate biochemical degeneration of hip cartilage associated with OA progression over the mid-term (6-8-year) period.  In this proposal, subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort (n=184 hips, 92 subjects), with the availability of existing 3-year follow-up data including bi- lateral hip radiographs and MR images, gait biomechanics and patient reported outcomes. We will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based T1ρ and T2 relaxation time on a voxel basis, which will provide precise and localized information on cartilage proteoglycan and collagen integrity and water content. Automatic segmentation techniques combined with machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze cartilage T1ρ/T2 in a well-characterized dataset with quantifiable T1ρ/T2 values on a voxel-level, and to automatically detect the patterns of focal T1ρ/T2 elevations that lead to later stage OA and drive progression of degenerative disease (over 8 years). Detailed analysis of gait biomechanics using functional principal component analysis will utilize the rich skeletal biomechanics data and imaging (over 8 years). Imaging the knee and hip longitudinally will provide a multi-joint analysis of OA progression (over 4 years) not done previously and will provide unique insights in the mechanisms in hip OA, connections with knee changes. Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease and understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, and the impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA. In this proposal subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort and we will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based measures of cartilage degeneration and determine the role of gait biomechanics on disease progression.","Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Skeletal Biomechanics",10317687,R01AR069006,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Cartilage', 'Cartilage Matrix', 'Collagen', 'Complex', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Financial Hardship', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Hip region structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Ipsilateral', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteoglycan', 'Relaxation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Water', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cartilage degradation', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint destruction', 'kinematics', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'obese person', 'quantitative imaging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'skeletal']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,709418
"A novel method for volumetric oxygen mapping in living retina PROJECT SUMMARY It is widely accepted that oxygen deficiency is a culprit and a marker of several major retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma etc. However, it remains to be extremely challenging to measure oxygen in vivo in the eye, and no tools currently exist that can provide 3D oxygen distributions in the retina with high spatial resolution at appropriate imaging speeds. The goal of this project is to overcome these limitations and develop a new optical imaging technique for volumetric oxygen mapping in retina. Our approach will leverage the recently developed potent oxygen probes (such as Oxyphor 2P), whose phosphorescence decay times serve as quantitative markers of local oxygen partial pressures (pO2) in living tissues. To enable volumetric imaging with high throughput, we propose to develop a novel imaging instrument, termed oblique scanning laser ophthalmoscope (oSLO). oSLO is based on the concept of single lens scanned light sheet microscopy and enables volumetric phosphorescence lifetime imaging without time- consuming plane-by-plane pixel-wise sectioning. Our new method should be able to achieve 10 kilohertz voxel rate that is three orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM). In this project we will: (Aim 1) develop a phosphorescence lifetime-based oSLO for volumetric pO2 mapping in living retina in mouse. The new design will allow parallel detection of signals at depth from each scanned location, so that the need in conventional depth sectioning is eliminated and imaging throughput is greatly increased. We will (Aim 2) dynamically image responses of retina and choroid to systemic hypoxia challenge using Oxyphor 2P. We will (Aim 3) then bridge oSLO measurements and label-free applications by multimodal imaging with visible light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT). Using vascular pO2 as the ground-truth, we will develop a deep spectral training (DSL) algorithm to supervise the inverse calculation of vis-OCT for robust and reliable label-free retinal oximetry. This study will enable the first direct quantitative imaging of interactions between the two circulatory systems in retina (i.e. retinal and choroidal circulation), providing unprecedented information about retinal oxygen supply. IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH: Successful completion of this program will deliver a new ground-breaking methodology for mapping oxygen in the retina that will greatly improve our understanding of retinal diseases. NARRATIVE Oxygen is essential in the retina, and the deficiency of oxygen is a culprit in a broad spectrum of retinal diseases. However, it remains challenging to measure oxygen in vivo in the eye. This multidisciplinary proposal is to develop a disruptive imaging method to provide unprecedented volumetric oxygen mapping in living mouse retina, as well as a deep learning method, to translate our oxygen measurements into label-free retinal oximetry for future clinical applications.",A novel method for volumetric oxygen mapping in living retina,10098478,R01EY032163,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Respiration', 'Choroid', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Dyes', 'Eye', 'Fluorescence Angiography', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inhalation', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Nobel Prize', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Partial Pressure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vascular System', 'Visible Radiation', 'adaptive optics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'choroidal circulation', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'design', 'hemodynamics', 'human imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'optical imaging', 'phosphorescence', 'porphyrin a', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'retina circulation', 'retinal imaging', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,552744
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Free Will', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indolent', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer imaging', 'chemoradiation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'nerve injury', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiation response', 'radical hysterectomy', 'response', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'water diffusion']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R37,2021,640083
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (HTx) is a well-established life-saving procedure but is associated with severe complications. Current clinical monitoring algorithms rely on frequent invasive procedures including endomyocardial biopsies and catheter angiography. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed non-invasive comprehensive cardiac MRI, which can quantify regional changes in myocardial tissue and function. Our efforts have focused on the 2 major complications of HTx: 1) acute cardiac rejection (ACR), the leading cause of death in the first year after transplant; and 2) cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality beyond the first post-Tx year. Our cardiac MRI studies have identified new imaging biomarkers in HTx. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between abnormal cardiac MRI measures and potential allograft failure: myocardial T2 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as non-invasive tissue biomarkers for ACR. We demonstrated that the natural history of myocardial scarring, T2, and ECV predicts adverse clinical events in HTx recipients. In addition, our studies showed that donor and recipient mismatch (age, sex, weight, etc.) was significantly associated with cardiac MRI-derived measures of myocardial edema/inflammation, fibrosis, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Over the past five years, the PIs have assembled a unique study database with over >450 comprehensive cardiac MRI exams comprising >110,000 annotated cardiac MRI images. For this renewal application, we identified the need to conduct further long-term follow-up studies tailored to the slow disease progression in HTx to identify changes over time in multiparametric MRI measures and predictors of HTx outcome. Second, data on graft tissue and function in the pediatric HTx population are scarce and improved strategies for donor-recipient matching in this vulnerable population are needed to make most efficient use of the limited availability of donor hearts in children. Thus, cardiac MRI needs to better account for age and sex related differences in patient habitus and physiology, critical for the wide age range in HTx from pediatric to adult. The renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop multiparametric cardiac MRI for the assessment of graft tissue (T2, T1, ECV), and dysfunction (myocardial velocities, strain) from pediatric to adult, 2) leverage the existing large cardiac MRI database (110,000 labeled cardiac MRI images) to establish deep learning based analysis pipelines for automated cardiac MRI analysis with improved efficiency and reduced inter-rater variability, 3) to identify predictors of adverse outcomes and to evaluate the impact of donor-recipient mismatch on graft tissue, function, and flow in a prospective study with pediatric HTx patients, and 4) to identify cardiac metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) HTx patient outcome by leveraging our HTx database (>145 HTx recipients with existing baseline cardiac MRI acquired during the initial funding cycle). Follow-up cardiac MRI will provide unique insights in changes over time in graft tissue and function as mechanism underlying different HTx patient trajectories (non-progression vs. late onset vs. slow progression vs. fast progression). PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop multiparametric cardiac MRI and automated deep learning based cardiac MRI analysis workflows for improved assessment for complications after heart transplantation, the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage heart failure. Cardiac MRI will be developed to allow for efficient application from pediatric to adult patients in order to evaluate its diagnostic value for non-invasively detecting complications and to investigate the impact of differences in heart donor and recipient characteristics on the performance of the transplanted heart. In addition, we will leverage an existing large cardiac MRI database to allow for long-term 5-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management in heart transplant recipients.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,10208494,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Angiography', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease Progression', 'Donor Selection', 'Donor person', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Label', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplantation Surgery', 'Transplanted Heart Complication', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Ventricular', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'graft failure', 'health care service utilization', 'heart allograft', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tissue biomarkers', 'transplant database', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,695340
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10232306,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'high body mass index', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,651069
"Cardiac photon counting CT and its application in studying interactions between Alzheimer's and heart disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aging is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The ongoing rise in both AD and CVD has been ascribed to the increasing adoption of a Western sedentary lifestyle accompanied by a diet rich in fats and sugars. To understand the links between AD and CVD in human subjects, non-invasive imaging methods such X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) are essential. Cardiac CT is one of the most powerful applications of these methodologies at both clinical and preclinical levels, but it is currently limited by its low contrast resolution. Our primary objective in this proposal is to improve the current status of cardiac CT based on photon counting detector technology and demonstrate its capabilities in preclinical studies focused on studying the interaction between CVD and AD. Our central hypothesis is that cardiac photon counting CT will provide low dose spectral characterization of atherosclerotic plaques together with cardiac function, while enabling longitudinal monitoring of interventions such as exercise. We will pursue three specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will develop the theoretical foundation and GPU optimized tools for reconstruction of cardiac 5D (3D + Time + Energy) photon counting CT data. We will incorporate deep learning solutions to overcome fundamental barriers to the advancement of this technology: regularization to deal with image noise associated with photon binning, robust material decomposition to combat spectral distortion, and automated cardiac function and plaque analysis to handle data dimensionality. During the second specific aim, we will characterize the performance of our novel cardiac photon counting CT imaging using simulations, phantoms and animal experiments to show its benefits for atherosclerotic plaque characterization and cardiac function estimation. Finally, in specific aim 3 we will investigate if cardiovascular risk impacts brain phenotypes in animal models of genetic risk for AD. CVD and AD share a genetic link via the ApoE gene and its isomorphic allele 4 (APOE4). We will use APOE3/HN and APOE4/HN mouse strains that express the corresponding specific targeted-replacement human APOE allele, on a humanized Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 (denoted here as HN) background. Using these models, we will first assess the impact of a high fat, high sugar diet on cardiovascular phenotypes (atherosclerotic plaque size, numbers; cardiac function measured with CT) and how these genetic differences are reflected in behavior and brain MR based biomarkers compared with control mice in the same background. Finally, we will also investigate the potential to rescue these phenotypes using exercise as the intervention. The impact of the proposed research will validate the usage of photon counting CT technology to enhance routine cardiac CT imaging applications. Our project will enable new powerful integrative approaches to examine the impact of environmental stressors to alter APOE genotype- specific vulnerability, or resilience to CVD and AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical, pathological and epidemiological evidence clearly show overlap between cardiovascular and Alzheimer’s diseases caused by a critical genetic link: the apolipoprotein E gene. We will develop novel photon counting cardiac CT imaging and use it in combination with brain MR imaging and behavior assessments to study the impact of APOE genotype in mouse models and to provide data on phenotypic differences in these mice when exposed to a high fat/high sugar diet and the role of exercise in protecting against Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases.",Cardiac photon counting CT and its application in studying interactions between Alzheimer's and heart disease,10094804,RF1AG070149,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune response', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'NOS2A gene', 'Names', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cardiac plaque', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'combat', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'environmental stressor', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise regimen', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mouse model', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'simulation', 'spectral distortion', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,1873076
"Correcting [18]F-Misonidazole PET with MRI and EPR to improve hypoxia-guided radiation therapy Project Summary  In this project, we propose to correct [18]F-Misonidazole (FMISO) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images to make PET be more accurate in measuring hypoxia. Hypoxia - a deficiency in oxygen - is a strong promotor of tumor radioresistance, yet there are no established clinical methods to accurately image oxygenation in vivo to improve treatment. Preclinical studies that acquired pO2 measurements using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging have shown that targeting hypoxic tumor sub-regions with a boost of TCD95 after irradiating the whole tumor with TCD15, significantly increased tumor control when compared to the boosting normoxic tumor sub-regions with TCD95. So far this has been demonstrated in fibrosarcoma (p = 0.04) and mammary carcinoma (p = 0.013) tumor types. This shows that if hypoxic tumor sub-regions can be accurately imaged and targeted with a boosted dose – better known as dose painting – the overall dose deposition to surrounding healthy tissues can be decreased while improving tumor control.  In recent years, clinical trials have used FMISO PET for radiation therapy dose plans with the hypothesis that targeting hypoxic tumor regions with a boost of radiation, as defined by FMISO uptake, would increase survival. These trials did not, however, show improvement when compared to treatment plans with and without a boost of radiation. These outcomes are in direct contrast to the EPR hypoxia studies previously mentioned. We hypothesize this is due to the imperfect binding mechanisms of FMISO to hypoxic cells, as well as general limitations of PET tracers being unable to reach hypoxic tumor regions due to their chaotic vasculature or acidosis. In response to the failure of using only FMISO PET to target hypoxia, we propose to include anatomical and physiological information of tumor vasculature and pH imaged with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, respectively. DCE-MRI and CEST-MRI will be used to correct the PET image to show hypoxic tumor regions, using EPR as the ground truth of hypoxia.  The specific aims of the proposal are to develop and execute a study design to (1) evaluate discrepancies between tumor hypoxia regions as defined by FMISO PET and EPR, (2) identify tumor features in DCE-MRI and CEST-MRI that result in poor overlap between hypoxia as defined by PET and EPR, and (3) develop a correction PET/MRI algorithm to improve PET measurement of hypoxia, using EPR hypoxia measurements as the gold standard. Upon completion, aim 1 will demonstrate the need for correcting FMISO PET images. Aim 2 will identify correlations between vascular permeability and pH features and low or high PET uptake, where it might not match with hypoxia as defined by EPR. The third aim will take those features to create a decision tree algorithm to correct FMISO PET definition of hypoxia. We intend for this PET/MRI correction algorithm to eventually be implemented in clinical trials to improve radiation therapy to hypoxic tumors. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to make FMISO PET more accurate in its measurement of tumor hypoxia. We aim to correct PET data with a combination of MRI images that map physiological properties of the tumor, such as vasculature and pH measurements, while using oxygen measurements from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging as the ground truth. This work will result in a PET/MRI correction algorithm with the intent to improve radiotherapy techniques and results.",Correcting [18]F-Misonidazole PET with MRI and EPR to improve hypoxia-guided radiation therapy,10234423,F31CA254223,"['Acidosis', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Body Temperature', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Deposition', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Rate', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia Inducible Factor', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misonidazole', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'experimental study', 'fibrosarcoma', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'promoter', 'radiation resistance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2021,46036
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders. This project will develop a robust noninvasive imaging technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that offers high spatial resolution, resistance to head motion and accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow in children and adolescents.

"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,10214689,R01HL151704,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Pacemakers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'RNA marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'cardioprotection', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'denoising deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exercise training', 'functional loss', 'heart function', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'preservation', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'reconstruction', 'sedentary', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,673600
"Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases Abstract Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC, surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin- echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a radial stack-of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim 3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in particular those with colorectal cancer. Project Narrative Liver metastases are common in colorectal cancer and knowledge of number, location and size impacts precision of therapy, survival and overall costs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used for evaluating liver metastases but detection and diagnosis of small tumors remains challenging.

"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,10093035,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558172
"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care. The purpose of this project is to develop and utilize a virtual framework to comprehensively evaluate and optimize emerging photon-counting devices and applications in CT imaging. The results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of photon-counting CT and will help establish its effectual utility in oncologic and cardiac care.",Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry,10189580,R01EB001838,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Anatomy', 'Cancerous', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Lesion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stenosis', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiac plaque', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'photon-counting detector', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'unethical', 'virtual', 'virtual imaging']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,534495
"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10206141,R03EB030280,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gallium', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroendocrine differentiation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'pentetreotide', 'radiologist', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'routine imaging', 'success', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,89563
"High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart Project Summary Ischemic preconditioning is a well-established phenomenon, in which a brief episode(s) of controlled ischemia and reperfusion renders cardioprotection from a subsequent sustained episode of ischemia. An emerging body of evidence demonstrated that neural regulated heart rate modulation confers cardiac preconditioning responses. Understanding the mechanism through model systems of preconditioning would help us identify the genes and proteins when designing future drug targets for the prevention of ischemic cardiac injury. As a promising alternative to electrical pacing to modulate heart rate, optogenetic pacing does not require physical contact, has high spatial and temporal precision, offers more specific excitation, and avoids artifacts from electrical stimulation. Recent developments in the field of optogenetics make it possible for non-invasive and specific optical control of the heart rhythm in animal models, such as in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is a powerful genetic model system that has been used since the early 1900s to characterize genes associated with human diseases, including cardiac diseases. Studies performed in flies can provide insights into conserved mechanisms in cardiac diseases, which can be applied to higher organisms, including humans. Working in collaboration with Drs. Airong Li and Rudolph Tanzi from the Massachusetts General Hospital, we demonstrated non-invasive optogenetic pacing and concurrent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the Drosophila heart for the first time. Recently, we further demonstrated red-light optogenetic pacing and successful optical control of tachycardia, bradycardia, and restorable cardiac arrest in fly models. Building on the decade-long productive collaboration with Drs. Li and Tanzi and new collaborations with Dr. Abhinav Diwan (cardiologist) and Dr. Jeanne Nerbonne (cardiac electrophysiologist) and Dr. Kenneth Schechtman (biostatistician) at Washington University, we propose to develop a high-throughput integrated OCT imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing system and establish a novel research platform to study preconditioning and hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart. We hypothesize that periods of bradypacing will precondition the fly heart to protect against hypoxia, via activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The specific aims are: 1) Develop and optimize a high-throughput integrated instrument for non-invasive OCT imaging and optogenetic control of fly heart function in vivo; 2) Develop double transgenic fly models and functional assays based on OCT imaging to characterize fly heart physiology in vivo; 3) Define functional and molecular changes in response to hypoxia and optogenetic preconditioning in transgenic fly models. If successful, the high-throughput optical imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing platform developed in this program combined with powerful double transgenic fly models will enable us to characterize changes of the fly heart function in response to different stress challenges that is not feasible before. This will allow us to perform a series of new experiments, providing insights into conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced cardiac changes and preconditioning. Project Narrative We will develop a novel research platform to noninvasively image and control heart function in fly models. Tachycardia, bradycardia and cardiac arrest will be stimulated using light and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning will be explored. The new knowledge and novel insights gleaned from these studies will advance our understanding of conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced changes in the heart and ischemic preconditioning.",High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart,10132500,R01HL156265,"['Abdomen', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Function Study', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glean', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intelligence', 'Ion Channel', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Preconditioning', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Lysosomes', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Opsin', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Side', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'cardioprotection', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart rhythm', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'instrument', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'preconditioning', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,529434
"Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract Shear Stress and Light-Field to Elucidate the Initiation of Cardiac Outflow Tract Biomechanical forces modulate cardiac morphogenesis, and mutations in mechano-sensitive signaling pathways result in congenital heart defects. During the previous funding cycle, our team custom-built a Light- Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) with sub-voxel resolution to enhance axial resolution needed to provide a large field-of-view. This laser optical system allowed for imaging pulsatile vs. oscillatory shear stress- mediated Notch signaling to initiate endocardial trabeculation. We demonstrated that spatial (/x) and temporal (/t) variations in shear stress modulates Notch-EphrinB2-Neureguilin-1 signaling in the endocardium to activate erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) that promotes proliferation of trabeculation. By integrating LSFM, computation, and transgenic models, we further established that trabeculation dissipates intracardiac shear stress-generated kinetic energy; thus, mitigating ventricular remodeling. However, it remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced myocardial contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis. Thus, we seek to integrate light-sheet (Bessel-Gaussian beam arrays) with a new 2) light-field (microlens array). The former provides non-diffracting illumination, and the latter provides volumetric detection as a paradigm shift to image both myocardial contractility and intracardiac flow dynamics in the outflow tract (OFT). Our preliminary study reveals that shear-mediated Notch1b expression in the endocardium of OFT regulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT); however, the mechanotransduction causation whereby myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress reciprocally interact to form bicuspid valves and subsequent remodeling to multi-cuspid valves remains elusive. Thus, our hypothesis is that integration of the new light-field system with imaging computation enhances spatiotemporal resolution needed to decouple myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics that modulates Notch1b-EndoMT to mediate valve morphogenesis in the OFT. In Aim 1, we plan to integrate light-sheet with the new light-field system for 4-D volumetric imaging of valve formation in the OFT. Our goal is to capture myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress at one snapshot. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the interaction between intracardiac shear stress and myocardial contractility underlying valve morphogenesis. Our goal is to decouple hemodynamic shear from contractile forces that mediate Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. In Aim 3, we will determine the relative role of shear stress and contractility underlying Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. Our goal is to elucidate the relative role of contractility and intracardiac stress to transmit Notch1b- EndoMT signaling underlying bicuspid-valve formation. Overall, our team aims to establish the micro- environment in which intracardiac flow dynamics and myocardial contractility interact to modulate OFT valve formation, with clinical significance to aortic valvular disease. Project Narrative Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects, including aortic valves and the greater arteries, are estimated to cause approximately 30% of these congenital heart diseases, and they are treated with surgical correction and/or replacement. It remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced cardiac contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis, including aortic stenosis, bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valves. To understand the mechanotransduction causation downstream of blood flow and shear stress sensing, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to integrate advanced laser optics, imaging computation, and genetic models to decouple intracardiac flow dynamics from myocardial contractility that modulates Notch1b-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) with translational implication to aortic valve disease.",Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract,10146767,R01HL129727,"['4D Imaging', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Arteries', 'Bicuspid', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Computer Models', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Coupled', 'Cuspid', 'Custom', 'Data Reporting', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Endocardium', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Microscopy', 'Mitral Valve', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Contraction', 'Neuregulin 1', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'erbB-2 Receptor', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'mechanotransduction', 'multidisciplinary', 'notch protein', 'optical imaging', 'response', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,459651
"OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions Project Summary/Abstract In this cycle of the project, we will extend OpenIGTLink software to enable individualized precision guidance, where patient-specific characteristics are taken into account in the planning and control process for image- guided robotic interventions (IGRI) to achieve a better clinical outcome. In particular, we will focus on improving needle placement accuracy for IGRI of the prostate, as a simple, and yet a representative application of individualized precision guidance. Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in both the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Nearly one million prostate biopsies are performed annually in the United States, where tissues are sampled from the prostate with a biopsy needle for pathological examination. The confirmed lesions may then be focally treated with brachytherapy or thermal ablation using applicator needles depending on clinical indications and patient preference. For those procedures, accurate needle placement is essential to avoid false-negatives or ensure an optimal dose distribution. The demand for accurate needle placement is growing in recent years, as clinicians are now capable of pinpointing subregions in a heterogeneous tumor thanks to the recent progress in imaging technologies, particularly multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the in vivo accuracies achieved by previous studies have never matched the level of tumor subregion targeting due to needle deviation as a result of physical interaction between the needle and the heterogeneous tissue. To address this issue, we will incorporate needle deviation models in an IGRI system using OpenIGTLink software. Our hypothesis is that the models adapted to individual patients will enable avoidance or compensation of needle deviation, leading to an improved in vivo needle placement accuracy. The project comprises the following four specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop a biomechanical model with image-based semi-automatic model generation; (Aim 2) Develop a data-driven prediction model and hybridize with the biomechanical model; (Aim 3) Extend the IGRI platform for model- based closed-loop control using OpenIGTLink; (Aim 4) Evaluate biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models in vivo needle placement. Project Narrative Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in biopsy and focal ablation of prostate cancer. The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate free open-source software named OpenIGTLink to support advanced image-guided robot-assisted systems, where a robotic system guides a needle into the prostate based on biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models that predict the tissue and needle deformation in the patient during insertion. We expect that the accurate prediction will enable individualized planning and control for robot-assisted needle placement and improve accuracy biopsy and focal ablation.",OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions,10211359,R01EB020667,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brachytherapy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Financial compensation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Ablation', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Structure of base of prostate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical practice', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'individual patient', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'real-time images', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'robotic system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tumor']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,701392
"Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures Project summary: This project will collect a unique, multi-modal, multi-contrast dataset with tracer injections and diffusion MRI in the same macaque brains. We will use this dataset to develop novel algorithms for inferring local fiber architectures from diffusion MRI. The goal is to overcome the limitations of current methods for diffusion orientation reconstruction, which are designed to resolve fiber crossings but not to distinguish between crossings and other configurations, such as branching, turning, fanning, etc. More broadly, the proposed dataset will allow us to investigate organizational principles of brain pathways and to provide a testbed for the neuroimaging community to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion tractography and microstructural modeling techniques. The project is a collaboration between groups with extensive expertise in diffusion MRI methodological development (MGH Martinos Center) and anatomical tracer studies (University of Rochester). We have previously collected high-resolution ex vivo diffusion MRI data on a set of macaque brains that had also received tracer injections. We have recently used these data in an open tractography challenge, with the participation of research teams from around the world. This was the first challenge of its kind to provide diffusion MRI data suitable for all state-of-the-art diffusion reconstruction methods (e.g., multi-shell or Cartesian grid sampling), in addition to providing the tracer injections in the same brains as the MRI scans. Our own preliminary studies and the challenge itself offer several insights into the performance of state-of-the-art tractography methods. For example, our results indicate that, while most tractography methods would require their parameters to be tuned differently to achieve optimal accuracy for different cortical seed regions, there are approaches that are robust across cortical areas. Furthermore, our results suggest that errors occur frequently in areas where the fiber architecture is not well modeled by a crossing. Thus there is a need for novel tractography approaches that go beyond the crossing-fiber paradigm. Here we propose to develop such an approach. Our prior work included injection sites in the frontal, prefrontal, and cingulate cortices only. Here we propose to investigate the extent to which our prior findings generalize across the brain, by performing tracer injections that sample a wider range of cortical areas. Furthermore, we will extend our acquisition protocol to acquire data appropriate not only for tractography, but also for microstructural and myelin mapping. These data will allow us to answer a broader range of questions about tractography, microstructure, and their intersection. Beyond the methodological development proposed in this project, the data will also be an invaluable resource to the neuroimaging community, providing researchers with a framework for the objective assessment of current diffusion MRI analysis methods and identifying areas for improvement to guide the development of next-generation techniques. Project narrative: This project will study organizational principles of brain pathways with a combination of chemical tracing and diffusion MRI. The ultimate goal is to assess and improve the accuracy of diffusion MRI, which is currently the only technique for imaging these pathways non-invasively and studying their role in the healthy and diseased brain in vivo. The unique dataset collected by this project will provide a testbed that can aid the neuroimaging research community in identifying shortcomings of current diffusion MRI analysis techniques and provide guidance towards seeking alternative approaches that overcome these shortcomings.",Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures,10099935,R01NS119911,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Macaca', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anatomical tracing', 'automated algorithm', 'brain pathway', 'cingulate cortex', 'convolutional neural network', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontal lobe', 'histological stains', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'sample fixation', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'tractography']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,666884
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,10155483,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'data quality', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,631942
"Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field Project Summary Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly, is of increasing relevance in the United States due to its aging population. It is generally agreed that the weakening of the muscle in sarcopenia cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass alone, but the mechanisms behind this remain poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of non-invasive techniques for observing muscle structure and composition in high detail. We propose to develop MRI techniques to measure muscle morphology, microstructure, and fat content to get a detailed view of the changes in muscle quantity and quality in patients with sarcopenia and how they relate to more easily attainable measurements of muscle function such as grip strength and gait speed. This would provide an important contribution to the ongoing debate about how such measurements could be used to define sarcopenia, which would pave the way for treatment development. We aim to develop novel methods to investigate the structure and composition of muscle using ultra-high-field MRI. Specifically, we aim to (1) obtain water-based images of skeletal muscle macro- and microstructure with unparalleled efficiency, image quality, and resolution; (2) obtain images of the spatial distribution of intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, measuring both methyl and methylene to estimate saturation; and (3) to conduct a study comparing skeletal muscle structure and quality by looking at MR measurements of T2 relaxation rates, diffusivity (as proxies for inflammation and fiber size, respectively), fat fraction, and lipid composition, in subjects with sarcopenia and healthy controls and see how these quantities correlate to muscle function. This project has several innovative aspects. First, we will develop a method to estimate muscle morphology, T2 relaxation rates, and diffusivity with a single MRI sequence. Importantly, this will make the developed method easy to run at other MRI sites. Second, we will devise methods to perform robust, efficient imaging of intramyocellular lipid droplet distribution and saturation in human skeletal muscle in vivo at high field. Both of these methods will have unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio and robustness against image artifacts. The significance of this work is the investigation of the role of inflammation, fiber size, and lipid distribution in the weakening of muscle in sarcopenia and how these measurements are related to muscle function. The resulting conclusions and techniques may help establish a common standard for the definition of sarcopenia and aid in the development of future treatments for this condition.

"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project.

"Integrating Quantitative MRI and Artificial Intelligence to Improve Prostate Cancer Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Prostate cancer (PCa) develops in sixteen percent of males and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. While incidence is high, PCa presents with a wide range of aggressiveness and in many cases does not develop into life-threatening aggressive cancer. Current diagnostic strategies may fail to detect all instances of clinically significant PCa and have limited ability to accurately distinguish clinically significant from indolent PCa due to incomplete and inconsistent information. This not only subjects patients to detrimental co-morbidities including overtreatment and undertreatment, but also exacerbates already significant healthcare costs. Consequently, there is an urgent clinical need to achieve accurate detection and classification of clinically significant PCa and determine the appropriate management strategy. Multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), consisting of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, has emerged as the preferred imaging technique for non-invasive detection and grading of PCa. However, the current standardized scoring system for mp-MRI, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2, has limited ability to distinguish between indolent and clinically significant PCa, with sensitivity and specificity in the range of 60-85%. This suboptimal accuracy and considerable variation in performance is mainly due to the fact that current PI-RADS scoring is based on qualitative analysis and subjective interpretation of mp-MRI, confounded by scanner- and patient-specific variations, including B1+ inhomogeneity, arterial input function, and susceptibility and eddy current effects. This proposal aims to overcome these critical limitations of current mp-MRI by establishing a new MRI-based artificial intelligence based on two synergistic innovations: 1) new quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI analysis techniques and diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition methods that minimize scanner- and patient-specific variations, and 2) novel multi-class deep learning models that can fully integrate the multi-labeled quantitative mp- MRI information. By leveraging the synergy between existing mp-MRI data and to-be-acquired quantitative mp- MRI data with subsequent mapping of all lesions at whole-mount histopathology, the proposed MRI-based deep learning model will be evaluated for detection and classification of clinically significant PCa, compared with the current standard-of-care, PI-RADS v2. Completion of this project will lead to the creation, clinical deployment, and pivotal validation of a new MRI-based artificial intelligence that achieves unprecedented accuracy for detection and classification of clinically significant PCa, thereby increasing confidence in separating indolent PCa from significant PCa and reducing unnecessary biopsies, undertreatment, and overtreatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current diagnostic strategies can fail to accurately detect and classify clinically significant prostate cancer, leading to detrimental overtreatment and undertreatment. This research project aims to jointly develop and integrate innovative quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms to achieve significantly improved accuracy for detection and classification of clinically significant prostate cancer. The new MRI- based artificial intelligence will be a transformative technology to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies and enhance decision making for patient management to avoid overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer.",Integrating Quantitative MRI and Artificial Intelligence to Improve Prostate Cancer Classification,10115677,R01CA248506,"['Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Incidence', 'Indolent', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Predisposition', 'Prostate', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diffusion weighted', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'male', 'men', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'prisma', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'standard of care', 'synergism']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,544992
"Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and a major public health crisis, currently affecting over 5.8 million Americans and expected to rise as the population ages. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can identify the hallmark proteinopathies of AD, including amyloid protein plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (composed primarily of tau protein) accumulating in the brain. While there is evident need for more PET neuroimaging, for example, to elucidate the sequence of amyloid and tau deposition in preclinical AD, its increased utility in longitudinal imaging studies with large study populations is limited by recruitment and cost. In particular, making multiple visits to the scanning site will be difficult for participants living far away, and the high cost of injected radiotracers will limit the scalability of PET studies.  In this project we propose using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for imaging AD. Our specific aims are (1) to validate the diagnostic value of the CNNs in actual ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau imaging sessions, with the injected dose as low as 1% of the original, and with actual ultra-low-dose data, to validate simulations for use in subsequent aims and future studies; (2) to apply the ultra-low-dose CNN to data collected on other PET systems and tracers, in order to demonstrate the CNN’s generalizability; and (3) to evaluate the value of deep learning-aided ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for tracking cognitive decline in a preclinical AD population.  The innovation of this work lies in using multimodal imaging in addition to advanced machine learning techniques to enable acquisition of diagnostic-level PET images at extremely low dose levels. Performing actual ultra-low-dose PET acquisitions is also highly novel in itself. The outcome of this proposal is removing the limiting factors to large-scale clinical longitudinal imaging, shortening acquisitions spanning multiple days and visits to several hours in one visit with a successive ultra-low-dose and full-dose dual-tracer scan protocol. Significant dose reduction can also be achieved, allowing for more frequent amyloid/tau PET scanning. This flexibility will not only increase the utility of PET, aid longitudinal studies in dementia, but enable future comprehensive imaging of multiple PET-based biomarkers as these tracers are being developed. Project Narrative  More frequent PET scans can be used for dementia, a major cause of deaths in the United States, to understand the pathogenesis of the brain proteinopathies involved, to identify at-risk individuals, and to provide outcome markers for clinical trials of anti-amyloid/tau therapies; but recruitment for studies, cost, and radiation dose to the scanned participant are critical factors limiting its use. This work aims to train versatile deep learning-based neural networks which can produce diagnostic-level images from ultra-low-dose (as low as 1%) amyloid and tau PET acquisitions. Our study will provide flexibility in recruitment (running ultra-low-dose and full-dose scans in succession for dual-tracer studies), reduce the cost for radiotracer use, and reduce the dose in scanned participants, a “win-win” for researchers and patients.",Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease,10214874,K99AG068310,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Drowning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactivity', 'Reading', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'imaging agent', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'longitudinal positron emission tomography', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'radiotracer', 'recruit', 'research study', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'simulation', 'study population', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,100863
"Next-Generation Cardiovascular MRI powered by Artificial Intelligence Project Summary/Abstract: Despite the accuracy and versatility of cardiovascular MRI, its footprint is only 1% among cardiac imaging tests (SPECT, echocardiography, CT, MRI) in the US. While there are several factors such as referral patterns favoring SPECT and echocardiography among cardiologists that account for low utilization, the two addressable obstacles that preclude widespread adoption are lengthy scan time (imaging facility operational cost) and reading (physician cost). These obstacles must be addressed for community hospitals with limited resources to adopt cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. While compressed sensing (CS), since its introduction into the MRI world in 2007, has led to highly-accelerated cardiovascular MRI acquisitions, the subsequent image reconstruction remains too slow (> 5 min for 2D time series, > 1 hour for 3D time series) for clinical translation (unmet need 1). Downstream, image analysis for cardiovascular MRI is notoriously labor intensive (e.g. 30- to 60-min) and limited (“circles” at two cardiac phases for cine MRI, whereas perfusion and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) images are evaluated visually), for what is essentially a basic computer vision task (unmet need 2). In direct response, we will address these two unmet needs and unlock the enormous potential of CMR using deep learning (DL). DL applications have exploded since advancements in optimization and GPU hardware. While several recent studies have applied neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-Nets, and Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) for reconstruction and segmentation, no study has implemented an inline end-to-end pipeline that receives raw k-space from the MRI scanner and delivers both reconstructed images and fully processed images automatically with high speed (< 1 min). The objectives of this study are: a) developing a network for image reconstruction with maximal acceleration (aim 1), (b) developing a network for image processing tasks (aim 2), and c) developing an integrated, end-to-end network that does both (aim 3). By developing an architecture that can simultaneously learn maximal acceleration, fine tune end-to-end performance, and perform reconstruction/inference using feed-forward networks, we anticipate a disruptive technology that will lead to a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and increase its footprint in community hospitals. This 2-year study is doable because of the requisite database of raw k-space (not derived from DICOM) data (N = 617) and annotated cardiac MR images (N=3,021) from over 3,000 patients existing at our institution. Success of this proposal will deliver a disruptive technology that has potential to cause a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and enable widespread adoption of cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a new-generation cardiovascular MRI technology empowered by artificial intelligence, more specifically deep learning. The proposed technology accurately reconstructs cardiovascular images and segments cardiac regions of interest within 1 min without any human intervention.

"Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis ABSTRACT Heart failure imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity and mortality, costing the United States in excess of $31 billion annually. An increasingly recognized major determinant of outcomes in heart failure is right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. However, the nature and character of RV contribution to cardiovascular outcomes remains poorly understood, largely due to the imprecision of imaging and interpretation of RV morphology and function. Echocardiography, with its high temporal resolution and low cost of acquisition, serves as frontline cardiovascular imaging and a mainstay in approaches to assessing RV morphology and function. However, echocardiographic imaging of the RV is limited by factors that include technical variation in image acquisition and heterogeneity in image assessment as well as overall interpretation. We postulate that deep learning based phenotyping can offer the ability to not only more precisely characterize RV function but also classify RV imaging phenotypes according to etiologic disease states and, even further, refine prognostic evaluations of future cardiovascular risk. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use video-based deep learning segmentation models to assess RV function, evaluate its cross-sectional relation with a range of expert-measured parameters, and examine its variation in the context of patient characteristics derived from large hospital-based cohorts. In Aim 2, we will use video-based deep learning models to produce imaging-based classification of RV disease and assess the ability of unsupervised approaches to classify RV dysfunction into various categories of disease etiology. In Aim 3, we will use models developed in part from training in Aims 1 and 2 to predict major cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure in addition to coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death in both hospital- based and community-based cohorts. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve the precision and standardization of RV phenotyping and determine the extent to which deep learning models can augment human assessment of the RV. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide the candidate with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine and translational imaging science. An advisory committee of established scientists/mentors in the fields of cardiac imaging, deep learning, data science, and translational science will guide the candidate in his transition to scientific independence over the course of the award period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Heart failure imposes a tremendous morbidity and mortality burden, costing the U.S. healthcare system over $31 billion per year. An under-recognized and yet important contributor to heart failure outcomes is right ventricular dysfunction, which remains understudied due to technical issues that have historically challenged conventional approaches to cardiovascular imaging. We will examine how deep learning models can precisely evaluate right ventricular function – and enable earlier, more accurate assessments of its contributions to cardiovascular risk.","Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis",10185865,K99HL157421,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Award', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Program Development', 'Prospective cohort', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Right Ventricular Function', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'hands on research', 'healthcare community', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'study population', 'success', 'temporal measurement']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,154780
"Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance (MR) reporter genes have the potential to monitor transgene expression non-invasively in real time at high resolution. These genes can be applied to interrogate the efficacy of gene therapy, to monitor viral therapeutics and viral gene delivery, to assess cellular differentiation, cell trafficking, and specific metabolic activity, and also assess changes in the microenvironment. Efforts toward the development of MR reporter genes have been made for over a decade, but, despite these efforts, the field is still in its early developmental stage. This reflects the fact that there are numerous complications, caused by the low sensitivity of detection, the need for substrates with their associated undesirable pharmacokinetics, and/or the difficult and, in some cases, delayed interpretation of signal changes. We have previously demonstrated that many of these challenges can be overcome with the use of a lysine rich protein (LRP) reporter gene, that is detectable by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI. However, to mature the CEST reporter gene technology and bring it towards clinical translation, its sensitivity and specificity need to be improved. In particular, the LRP reporter gene specificity is limited by the fact that the lysine amide exchangeable protons of LRP have the same chemical shift as amide protons from endogenous proteins. It is therefore difficult to distinguish the reporter CEST contrast from the background CEST contrast, both of which may be changing with time. The specificity is further limited by the sensitivity of the CEST contrast to intracellular pH where the qualitative CEST contrast cannot distinguish between exchange rate and concentration effects. Finally, a decrease in cytosolic pH, observed in many disease pathologies, reduces the amide proton exchange rate and hence the CEST reporter sensitivity. We therefore propose to develop improved MRI reporter genes and quantitative MRI detection methods that will facilitate the clinical translation of these methods for imaging biological therapeutics, such as oncolytic virotherapy. We hypothesize that CEST reporter genes with improved sensitivity and specificity along with improved quantitative CEST methods will enable viral infection and replication to be monitored longitudinally throughout OV tumor therapy. To test this hypothesis and establish the clinical potential of MRI reporter genes we will capitalize on two transformative technologies developed in our labs; (Aim 1) an artificial intelligence based genetic programming algorithm will be used for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of the CEST reporter gene and (Aim 2) a CEST magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method will be used for the rapid quantification of both the reporter protein concentration and chemical exchange rate. (Aim 3) These methods will be validated for imaging oncolytic viral infection and replication in mouse glioblastoma tumor models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cell and viral based therapies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of many diseases. However, the optimization of such biological therapies depends critically on the ability to monitor the spread and persistence of the therapeutic agent and assess the tissue response. This project therefore proposes to develop and optimize a novel MRI reporter gene technology that allows for the imaging of biological therapeutics. The reporter gene technology will be demonstrated for monitoring oncolytic virotherapy in glioblastoma tumor models, however, the technology is generalizable to any biological therapeutic.",Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging,10180072,R01EB031008,"['Algorithms', 'Amides', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Evolution', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protons', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detection method', 'detection sensitivity', 'gene therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'oncolytic virotherapy', 'pre-clinical', 'radio frequency', 'rapid technique', 'response', 'therapeutic gene', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transgene expression', 'tumor', 'viral gene delivery']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,680476
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,10114224,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'PSA level', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,414490
"Cardiac MR-Based Risk Stratification for Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in HCM Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting as many as 1:200 individuals in the general population. HCM, initially described in the context of sudden cardiac death (SCD), is commonly associated with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Rigorous research over the past two decades has enabled us to identify HCM patients at the greatest risk of SCD who could benefit from a prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With advances in SCD prevention, HCM management has now shifted its focus to HF and AF. Nearly 50% of HCM patients have mild to severe HF symptoms. HF is now considered the most common cause of HCM-related mortality. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, occurring in nearly 25% of HCM patients, and responsible for a decreased quality of life and increased stroke risk. Currently, we are not able to predict which HCM patients are more likely to progress toward end-stage HF or develop AF. Cardiovascular imaging using echocardiography and cardiac MR has played a central role in our evolving understanding of HCM. Echocardiography provides a robust assessment of left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. With its high spatial resolution and remarkable tissue characterization capabilities, cardiac MR has emerged as an imaging modality well suited to characterize the HCM phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel risk stratification paradigms by leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve HCM patient management. We will investigate a deep learning (DL) risk model for prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes that incorporates (a) standard clinical and imaging parameters and (b) novel cardiac MR signatures extracted using (i) radiomic analysis (i.e. a computational method to automatically extract and select clinically significant imaging markers) or (ii) deep imaging signatures, extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The performance of these models will be rigorously evaluated using 3 HCM cohorts collected at Tufts Medical Center, BIDMC, and University of Toronto.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation.

"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Ultra-Fast Knee MRI with Deep Learning ABSTRACT Fast, robust and reliable quantitative knee joint MR imaging would be a significant step forward in studying joint degeneration, injury and osteoarthritis (OA). Automation of compositional and morphological feature extraction of the tissues in the knee it is an essential step for translation to clinical practice of promising quantitative techniques. It would enable the analysis of large patient cohorts and assist the radiologist/clinician in augmenting the value of MRI. Automation of several human tasks has been achieved in the last few years by the usage of Deep Learning techniques. With the availability of large amounts of annotated data and processing power, using the concepts of transforming data to knowledge by the observation of examples, supervised learning can today accomplish challenges never demonstrated before. In addition to image analysis and interpretation, Deep Learning is revolutionizing the acquisition and reconstruction aspects of the pipeline. Models can learn a direct mapping between under sampled k-space and image domain. While Deep Learning application to musculoskeletal imaging showed promising results when applied in a controlled setting, it is well understood that generalization beyond the statistical distribution of the training set is still an unmet challenge. In MRI this translates into poor performances when trained models are tested on different imaging protocols or images acquired on different MRI systems. With this proposal, we aim to leverage on this recent advancement and filling the existing gaps. We aim to study novel integrated models able to simultaneously accelerate MRI acquisition and automate the image processing that can overcome the limitation of single domain application. Fast image acquisition and accurate image post processing are typically considered to be separate problems. However, the neural networks optimization design gives us an opportunity to integrate the two to maximize both acceleration and machine-based image processing and interpretation. We will use both publicly available benchmark dataset (FastMRI) and internally collected dataset to build deep learning models able to accurately reconstruct under sampled MRI acquisitions. We will use a dataset prospectively acquired during the course of this study to validate the clinical applicability of the developed methods. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the proposed integrated pipeline can be applied in clinical setting for a fast and intelligent knee scan obtaining image quality comparable to standard acquisition and automated processing accuracy comparable with human reproducibility. Additionally, we propose to make our annotated image datasets and trained models a shared resource, a centralized, open evaluation platform for MRI reconstruction and image post processing techniques. NARRATIVE This study aims to use Deep Learning to simultaneously accelerate knee MRI acquisition and automate post processing pipelines including multi tissue segmentation, detection and severity staging of osteoarthritis degenerative changes. The proposed study builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize knee MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a first step towards on real time automatic image inspection and personalized imaging protocolling.",Ultra-Fast Knee MRI with Deep Learning,10177641,R01AR078762,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Knee', 'Knee joint', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Distributions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Vendor', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'data space', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'domain mapping', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'joint destruction', 'learning ability', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'research study', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,574344
"Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF. Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble” DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter- radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others. Project Narrative  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of illness and death worldwide, and it is a significant healthcare and financial burden. Liver fibrosis (LF) is a measurable feature of CLD that is important to assess the severity of disease, evaluate for progression and therapy response, and predict outcomes. We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to noninvasive conventional magnetic resonance images and readily- available clinical data for accurate detection and quantification of LF, thus significantly impacting public health by facilitating personalized therapies without the need for liver biopsy, improved outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.",Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning,10096229,R01EB030582,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilirubin', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Making', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fatty Liver', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Portal Hypertension', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling Errors', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spleen', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Vendor', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'accurate diagnosis', 'accurate diagnostics', 'chronic liver disease', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic technologies', 'elastography', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'liver biopsy', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'non-linear transformation', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sex']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,628266
"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially deep learning, has provided us new tools and new angles to tackle this challenging problem. This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images. As all learning-based image registration methods try to better use population knowledge to improve the registration performance, few of them have been able to efficiently use patient specific information, which can be essential to obtain robust and accurate performance. Upon successful completion, the innovation created from the project will disrupt the common perception that hardware tracking has to be used for multimodal image fusion-guided interventions and alleviate the demand on physicians’ experience and skill in image analysis and fusion to help obtain consistent results. This project will lead to the development of novel prostate biopsy systems and will also impact a range of other image fusion based interventional guidance technologies. Fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted prostate biopsies can significantly improve the detection of aggressive cancer.

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",10084899,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,616003
"Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Project Summary Organ motion is a predominant limiting factor for the maximum exploitation of modern radiation therapy (RT). Adverse influence of the organ motion is aggravated in hypofractionated treatment because of protracted dose delivery. Current image guided RT often relies on the use of implanted fiducial markers (FMs) for online/offline target localization, which is invasive and costly, and introduces possible bleeding, infection and discomfort of the patient. In this project, we harness the enormous potential of deep learning and investigate a novel markerless localization strategy by combined use of a pre-trained deep learning model and kV X-ray projection or cone beam CT images. We hypothesize that incorporation of deep layers of image information allows us to visualize otherwise invisible target in real-time and greatly reduce the uncertainties in beam targeting. Specific aims of the project are to: (1) Develop a DL-based tumor target localization framework for image guided RT (IGRT); (2) Apply the DL-based strategy to localize prostate target on 2D kV X-ray projection and 3D CBCT images; and (3) Evaluate the potential clinical impact of the DL strategy for pancreatic IGRT. This study brings up, for the first time, highly accurate markerless target localization based on deep learning and provides a clinically sensible solution for IGRT of prostate and pancreas cancers or other types of cancers. Successful completion of this investigation will significantly advance the current beam targeting technique and provide radiation oncology discipline a powerful way to safely and reliably escalate the radiation dose for precision RT. Given its significant promise to optimally cater for inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, the study should lead to substantial improvement in patient care and enables us to utilize maximally the technical capability of modern RT such as IMRT and VMAT. Given the dose responsive nature of various cancers and that the proposed method requires no hardware modification, this research should lead to a widespread impact on the management of neoplasmic diseases affected by organ motion. Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Project Narrative This project is aimed at establishing a deep learning-based image guidance strategy for motion management in prostate and pancreas radiation therapy. Successful completion of this investigation will significantly advance the current beam targeting technique and provide radiation oncology discipline a powerful way to safely and reliably escalate the radiation dose for precision radiation therapy.

"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10234187,R01HL127661,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Selection Criteria', 'Speed', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'base', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,735785
"Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI Sensitive imaging biomarkers are urgently needed for screening of high‐risk subjects, determine early disease progression, and assess response to therapies in neurodegenerative disorders. The atrophy of several brain regions is an established biomarker in AD, which strongly correlates with AD neuropathology. The accuracy of subfield volumes and cortical thickness estimated from current MRI methods is limited because of the vulnerability to motion, low spatial resolution, low contrast between brain sub‐structures, and dependence of current segmentation frameworks on image quality. Short motion‐compensated MRI protocols to map the human brain at high spatial resolution with multiple contrasts, along with accurate and computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, are urgently needed tor early detection and management of subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. We propose to introduce a 15‐minute motion‐robust 3‐D acquisition and reconstruction scheme to recover whole‐brain MRI data with 0.2 mm isotropic resolution with several different inversion times on 7T, along with segmentation algorithms that are robust to acceleration. The key difference of this framework from current approaches, which rely on MRI data 1 mm resolution, is the quite significant increase in spatial resolution to 0.2 mm as well as the availability of multiple conteasts. This improvement is enabled by innovations in all areas of the data‐processing pipeline, including acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. These innovations are facilitated and integrated by the model based deep learning framework (MoDL); this framework facilitates the joint exploitation the available prior information, including motion and models for magnetization evolution, with convolutional neural network blocks that learn anatomical information from exemplar data. The successful completion of this framework will yield sensitive biomarkers, which will be considerably less expensive than PET and does not involve radiation exposure. As 7T clinical scanners become more common, this framework can emerge as a screening tool for high‐risk subjects (e.g. APOE, PSEN mutations) and assess progression in patients with short follow‐up duration. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is now a major public health concern with life expectancy at an all-time high. In US alone, the number of affected patients is expected to triple to 13.8 million by the year 2050. This proposal focuses on the development of an ultra-high resolution multicontrast MRI protocol, with the objective of improving the accuracy of brain atrophy rates in early AD subjects. The successful completion of this proposal will yield a biomarker that is sensitive to early brain changes in AD, which can facilitate early detection in high risk population, measure progression, and quantify the efficacy of brain sparing drugs.",Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI,10120861,R01AG067078,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evolution', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive testing', 'convolutional neural network', 'data analysis pipeline', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'direct application', 'entorhinal cortex', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'sex', 'ultra high resolution']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,727486
"Copper-mediated Radiofluorination: from Proof-of-Concept to Clinical Impact Abstract: Radiotracers containing [18F]-labeled electron-rich aromatic rings are among the most highly sought- after PET imaging agents but have been historically challenging to synthesize. Recent efforts have sought to improve the late-stage labeling of (hetero)arenes with [18F]fluoride. In particular, transition metal-mediated reactions using high molar activity [18F]fluoride have changed the way radiochemists form C–18F bonds, and copper-mediated radiofluorination (CMRF) has proven one of the most versatile of approaches. In the previous award, we reported 10 new CMRF reactions, validated them for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and used them to synthesize FDA-approved clinical doses. However, despite many successes, several key challenges remain for the widespread clinical application of CMRF: (a) many important organic scaffolds are incompatible with existing CMRF processes, (b) yields of automated CMRF methods are typically moderate and thus unsuitable for commercial distribution, and (c) disposable cassette technologies are not available for CMRF on automated radiosynthesizers, limiting radiotracer production for routine clinical use. All of these challenges will be addressed in this renewal proposal. The overall objective is to develop robust methods for clinical production of diverse PET radiotracers. Our central hypothesis is that CMRF is uniquely positioned to enable us to achieve this goal. The proposed research will identify new reactions to radiofluorinate scaffolds that are incompatible with existing CMRF (Aim 1), use cutting edge machine learning techniques to improve automated CMRF yields (Aim 2), and develop cassette technologies for reliable GMP production of clinical radiotracers using CMRF (Aim 3). The research is significant because it entails development of methods for radiolabeling bioactive molecules containing functionality that is incompatible (or low yielding) with existing CMRF (heterocycles like pyridine and morpholine, drug molecules like GW405833), as well as optimized automated methods and cassettes for radiotracers that have been challenging to access for decades (e.g. [18F]FDOPA). The viability of the proposed efforts is supported by extensive preliminary results that provide groundwork for the exciting new research directions. Our team has been collaborating for 7 years and our expertise in transition metal catalysis (Sanford), radiochemistry (Scott), and machine learning (Doyle) uniquely positions us to accomplish the proposed research. The project goals will be accomplished through a variety of innovations including: (1) developing methods for labeling challenging electron-rich (hetero)arenes from new precursors (C–H bonds, aryl halides), (2) the first application of machine learning to radiochemistry, and (3) development of automated cassettes for conducting CMRF using the newest generation of radiosynthesizers designed for plug-and-play production. Overall, this project will deliver multiple new methods for synthesizing 18F-labeled radiotracers that are inaccessible using existing methods, and validated clinical syntheses of important radiotracers. All of these deliverables will expand the utility of PET imaging for the detection, treatment, and prevention of disease. Project Narrative: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a non-invasive molecular imaging technique that allows real-time in vivo monitoring of physiological processes via administration of a radiotracer (a molecule tagged with a PET radioisotope) to a patient. Currently, PET imaging finds application in drug discovery, disease diagnosis and monitoring, and personalized medicine. Approximately 2 million PET scans are conducted annually, and there is significant room for further growth. However, the impact of PET cannot be fully realized without both new synthetic methods for the assembly of radiotracers as well as the translation of these synthesis methods to routine clinical production. The overall objective of our research is to develop new chemistry for preparing currently inaccessible PET radiotracers, use machine learning techniques to optimize production yields with these new methods, and introduce automated cassette technology that will allow easy and confident use of this new chemistry to produce PET radiotracers for clinical trials and routine standard of care.",Copper-mediated Radiofluorination: from Proof-of-Concept to Clinical Impact,10209444,R01EB021155,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Catalysis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Copper', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Electrons', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorides', 'Fluorine', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Label', 'Levodopa', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nuclear', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Radiochemistry', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiolabeled', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Side', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transition Elements', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'aryl halide', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'drug discovery', 'imaging agent', 'imaging detection', 'improved', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'molecular imaging', 'morpholine', 'neural network', 'personalized medicine', 'preclinical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'pyridine', 'radiotracer', 'random forest', 'scaffold', 'standard of care', 'success']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,377343
"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,10144432,R21EB028954,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'research facility', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,209375
"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections. We will use this method to gain a better understanding of the relationship between Parkinson’s disease and cerebral blood flow, and expect that our method will have multiple applications beside Parkinson’s disease.",Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease,10266020,R01NS112233,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteries', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fatigue', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human Volunteers', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Noise', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spin Labels', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'deep learning', 'feeding', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'perfusion imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vascular factor', 'vector', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,281031
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,10110023,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'risk prediction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,777637
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD.

"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership. The MOLAR solution aims to fully account for interfraction variations, thereby substantially improving the accuracy and effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) for cancer.

"A comprehensive deep learning framework for MRI reconstruction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The primary goal of this investigation is to develop and validate a comprehensive, robust deep learning (DL) framework that improves MRI reconstruction beyond the limits of existing technology. The proposed framework uses “plug-and-play” algorithms to combine physics-driven MR acquisition models with state-of-the-art learned image models, which are instantiated by image denoising subroutines. To fully exploit the rich structure of MR images, we propose to use DL-based denoisers that are trained in an application-speciﬁc manner. The proposed framework, termed PnP-DL, offers advantages over other existing DL methods, as well as compressed sensing (CS). Compared to existing DL methods for MRI reconstruction, PnP-DL is more immune to inevitable variations in the forward model, such as changes in the coil sensitivities or undersampling pattern, allowing it to generalize across applications and acquisition settings. Compared to CS, PnP-DL recovers images faster, with higher quality, and with potentially superior diagnostic value. Our preliminary results highlight the potential of PnP-DL to advance MRI technology. In this work, we will fur- ther develop PnP-DL and validate it in these major applications: cardiac cine, 2D brain, and 3D brain imaging. In Aim 1, we will train and optimize convolutional neural network-based application-speciﬁc denoisers for the above-mentioned applications. The denoiser with the best denoising performance will be selected for further investigation. In Aim 2, we will develop and compare different PnP algorithms. The algorithm yielding the best combination of reconstruction accuracy and computational speed will be implemented in Gadgetron for inline processing. In Aim 3, we will compare the performance of PnP-DL to other state-of-the-art methods using retro- spectively undersampled data. This study will demonstrate that, in terms of image quality, PnP-DL is superior to CS and existing DL methods and, despite higher acceleration, is non-inferior to parallel MRI with rate-2 acceler- ation. In Aim 4, we will evaluate the performance of PnP-DL using prospectively undersampled data from adult and pediatric patients. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate that PnP-DL outperforms state- of-the-art methods in terms of image quality while exhibiting a level of robustness and broad applicability that has eluded other DL-based MRI reconstruction methods. The acceleration and image quality improvement afforded by these developments will beneﬁt almost all MRI applications, including pediatric imaging, where reducing sedation is a pressing need, and high-dimensional imaging applications (e.g., whole-heart 4D ﬂow imaging), which are too slow for routine clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many advantages over other imaging methods, but MRI is slow. Addi- tional developments are required to shorten the scan time, improve patient comfort, reduce the use of sedation for imaging children, and improve image quality. In this project, we will develop faster and more accurate methods for MRI. These efforts should lead to signiﬁcant improvements in the diagnosis of different diseases, so that patients may beneﬁt from appropriate treatment.",A comprehensive deep learning framework for MRI reconstruction,10211757,R01EB029957,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Network-based', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Recovery', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'computer framework', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'design', 'heart imaging', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'real-time images', 'reconstruction', 'repository']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,613825
"Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays an increasing role in guidance of interventional radiology (IR) procedures in the abdo- men, with special emphasis in embolization procedures, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or transarterial embolization (TAE) for control of internal hemorrhage. However, relatively long scan time of CBCT results in artifacts arising from organ motion (respiratory and cardiac motion and peristalsis). This poses a significant challenge to guidance in interventional radiology: for example, motion artifacts were found to render up to 25% of CBCT images un-interpretable in image-guided TACE, and 18% in CBCT-guided emergency TAE. The impact of motion is most significant in cases of single or isolated lesions treated with selective embolization that requires visual- ization of very small vascular structures. Existing motion correction methods often invoke assumption of periodicity, lim- iting their applicability outside of cardiac and respiratory motions, or rely on fiducial tracking or gated acquisition that disrupt IR workflow and/or increase radiation dose. Therefore, the application of CBCT in image-guided interventional procedures in the abdomen would significantly benefit from new methods that estimate complex deformable motion directly from image data. “Autofocus” techniques based on maximization of a regularized image sharpness criterion were shown to yield effective patient motion compensation in extremity, head and cardiac CBCT. However, current applications of such methods are limited to rigid motions. We hypothesize that deformable organ motion compensation in interven- tional soft-tissue CBCT can be achieved with advanced autofocus techniques using multiple locally rigid regions of in- terest, preconditioned with basic motion characteristics obtained through a machine learning decision framework. The following aims will be pursued: 1) Develop a joint multi-region autofocus optimization method to compensate deforma- ble organ motion. This includes incorporation into a comprehensive artifacts correction and image reconstruction pipe- line, design of multi-stage optimization schedules for convergence acceleration, and performance evaluation in deforma- ble phantoms, and cadaver and animal experiments. 2) Develop a decision framework for preconditioning of the motion compensation method through a combination of projection-based approaches for physiological signal estimations (res- piratory cycle) and a multi-input, multi-branch, deep learning architecture trained on extremely realistic simulated data that will estimate basic properties of motion (spatial distribution of amplitude, direction, and frequency) from an initial motion-contaminated image and its associated raw projection data. 3) Evaluate deformable motion compensation in animal experiments and in a clinical study in 50 cases of CBCT-guided TACE and assess image quality via expert observer evaluation of satisfaction and utility. The proposed work will yield a robust, practical method for compensation of deform- able soft-tissue motion in CBCT, removing a critical impediment to 3D guidance in IR. The deformable autofocus frame- work will be applicable to other interventions in which soft-tissue motion diminishes CBCT guidance, such as image-guided radiation therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventional Cone Beam CT (CBCT) provides critical 3D information to guide minimally-invasive procedures in the abdomen, but CBCT image quality is often compromised by organ deformation due to breathing, cardiac, and peristaltic motions. We propose a novel framework to mitigate the effects of this complex deformable motion using only the CBCT image data, without a need for gating, external trackers, or fiducial markers. This algorithm will remove a major impediment to 3D guidance in procedures such as transcatheter embolization procedures in the abdomen.",Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology,10100337,R01EB030547,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Arterial Embolization', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cadaver', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoembolization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Emergency Situation', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Frequencies', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Peristalsis', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate Ablation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'heart motion', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'internal control', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'preconditioning', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'tumor']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,368438
"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10206138,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluable Disease', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver parenchyma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'dosimetry', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,657625
"Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning Project Summary  Clinical and research applications of the PET imaging are rapidly expanding from ever improving diagnostic and treatment assessment applications to guidance of personalized treatments, ultra-low dose imaging, and even interventional imaging procedures. Supporting these developments, reconstruction tools that are able to reliably handle both typical and (ultra-)low count situations, imperfect data, and data from specialized imaging geometries, with fast (near real-time) reconstruction performance are of crucial importance. The overall goal of this project is to develop and investigate robust and efficacious Deep Learning (DL) reconstruction approaches addressing these needs. A unique and innovative feature of the proposed approaches (compared to alternative DL applications) is the utilization of list-mode data histogrammed into a very efficient histo-image format. TOF data partitioned into the histo-image format are characterized by strong local properties, thus perfectly fitting convolutional neural network formalism and making DL training and reconstruction directly from realistic clinical data (in size and character) highly feasible and practical.  The clinical utility of PET systems has significantly improved over the years thanks to advances in instrumentation, data corrections, and reconstruction approaches. Nevertheless, full utilization of their potential through robust and fast quantitative reconstruction remains a challenge especially for the cases of very low count data, such as in low-count temporal (motion and dynamic) frames, delayed studies, longitudinal low-dose studies, and studies using new isotopes with long half-life and low positron fraction rates (e.g. in 89Zr-labeled CAR-T cell imaging), as well as in specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage, for which exact, artifact-free, reconstruction does not exist. These are the situations for which the developed DL approaches promise great potential due to the demonstrated success of the DL networks to be trained for imperfect and very low count data without reliance on accurate data models. Furthermore, pre-trained networks can provide ultra- fast, near real-time, performance in practical use.  Specific Aim 1 will develop tools for DL PET reconstruction using histo-image partitioning along with procedures for training of the proposed DL approaches, including novel approaches advancing the state-of-the- art of DL reconstruction directly from acquired PET data. Specific Aim 2 is directed towards study and evaluation of the performance of the investigated DL approaches for whole-body and long axial FOV scanner data for the wide range of counts from applications such as typical FDG, low dose, delayed, low activity isotope scans, and ultra-short frames in motion correction and dynamic studies. Specific Aim 3 will develop and apply motion correction protocols involving the proposed DL reconstruction tools and test and study their efficacy for clinically realistic situations involving non-rigid lung and heart motions. And finally, Specific Aim 4 is dedicated to an application and study of the developed DL approaches to specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage. 1 Project Narrative  The major goal of this project is to improve the diagnostic, treatment guidance, and research utility of quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, through the development of robust, near real-time, deep-learning based reconstruction approaches allowing efficacious use of standard, low dose, and novel low activity imaging molecular bio-tracers. The proposed work is relevant to public health, since an improvement in the reconstructed images will lead to more accurate diagnosis of diseases and more accurate treatment guidance and monitoring of the response to therapy, while allowing for decreased patient radiation dose. It will also facilitate quantitatively reliable tools for research investigations with new radiotracers for PET tailored to specific diseases. 2",Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning,10276952,R01EB031806,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Application procedure', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Breast', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Isotopes', 'Label', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cellular imaging', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'detector', 'disease diagnosis', 'efficacy evaluation', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning network', 'loss of function', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'proton therapy', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'solid state', 'statistics', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,620138
"Quantitative CEST MRI for GBM Early Response Prediction and Biopsy Guidance ABSTRACT  Despite advances in therapy, the most aggressive form of brain tumor, glioblastoma, remains almost universally fatal. The first-line therapy for this devastating cancer is maximum feasible surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy (CRT). It is encouraging that there are multiple second-line therapies in clinical trials that could improve life quality or prolong survival, such as anti- angiogenic therapy (AAT). In this scenario, the accurate determination of whether a patient is a responder or a non-responder at an early stage following CRT has become a significant factor in clinical practice. However, the limitations in neuroimaging complicate the clinical management of patients and impede efficient testing of new therapeutics. Even with the improvements in advanced imaging modalities, distinguishing true progression vs. pseudoprogression (induced by CRT), or response vs. pseudoresponse (induced by AAT) remain two of the most formidable diagnostic dilemmas. Hence, the current gold standard for diagnosis and local therapy planning is still based on pathologic appraisal of tissue samples. However, even this yields variable results due to the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of treatment response. Therefore, reliable imaging tools, capable of early prediction of the tumor response to clinical therapies, are urgently needed. Amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging is a chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-based molecular MRI technique, which has been demonstrated to add important value to the clinical MRI assessment in neuro-oncology. However, most currently used imaging protocols are essentially semi-quantitative, and the images obtained are often called APTw images because of other contributions. Notably, it has been shown that quantitative CEST-MRI is able to achieve more pure and higher APT signals in patients with brain tumors. On the other hand, deep- learning is a state-of-the-art imaging analysis technique that provides exciting solutions with minimum human input. In particular, the saliency maps derived act as a localizer for class-discriminative regions, and may have great potential to guide biopsies and local treatment regimens. The goals of this proposal are to demonstrate the potential of quantitative CEST-MRI to resolve two formidable diagnostic dilemmas for GBM patients and to develop an automated deep-learning framework for post-treatment surveillance and biopsy guidance. This application has three specific aims: (1) Implement and optimize the quantitative CEST-MRI technique and quantify its accuracy in predicting early response to CRT and survival; (2) Determine the capability of quantitative CEST-MRI to assess the response to bevacizumab; and (3) Develop a deep-learning pipeline that includes structural and CEST images for responsiveness differentiation and stereotactic biopsy guidance. If successful, our results—and particularly the deep-learning platform established—will be readily available to accurately identify early response and guide stereotactic biopsy, thus changing the clinical pathway. Distinguishing recurrent tumor from treatment effect following therapy remains a major clinical challenge in neuro-oncology. We will assess the potential of quantitative CEST imaging methodologies and develop an automated, deep-learning framework for post-treatment surveillance and biopsy guidance. If successful, the implications for the clinical management of patients with brain tumors and for the robust evaluation of the efficacy of experimental therapeutics are enormous.",Quantitative CEST MRI for GBM Early Response Prediction and Biopsy Guidance,10118591,R37CA248077,"['Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amides', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Local Therapy', 'Localized Malignant Neoplasm', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment Protocols', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnosis standard', 'efficacy evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'temozolomide', 'treatment effect', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,382996
"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,10107816,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostatic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'advanced prostate cancer', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'early phase trial', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer risk', 'prostate lesions', 'real-time images', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,344156
"Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative tracer images from combined PET-CT and PET-MR are increasingly being utilized for radiological decision-making and clinical trials. CT and MR based data corrections for PET photon attenuation, typically the largest impact on tracer quantification, can lead to increased radiation dose to the subject or require lengthy additional dedicated MR scans, respectively. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the PET signal originating from the subject alone to estimate attenuation have shown promising early results, but, can have reduced performance when applied to exams different from the training data. Reconstruction methods that jointly estimate both the measured attenuation and tracer contrast from the subject PET signal represent a viable alternative, but, to date, have failed to match the quantification of CT approaches. Consequently, no single approach for PET attenuation correction that consistently produces high quantification and does not compromise patient safety or throughput currently exists. This is an important problem, since research and clinical findings must balance these practical issues with data quality. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and characterize a high performance attenuation correction scheme that utilizes both the PET signal from the subject and a variable activity external source. The central hypothesis is that the proposed reconstruction method will have significantly improved performance over reconstruction algorithms using PET signal originating from the subject alone, independent of the imaging study. The two specific aims include: 1) developing and validating a supplemental transmission-based algorithm for correcting PET images for photon attenuation during commercial PET imaging and 2) prototyping and characterizing a device capable of dynamically varying external source activity. The result of Aim 1 will be a reconstruction algorithm that is optimized to produce quantitative PET data for some of the most common clinical PET studies. Under Aim 2, a prototype device that can repeatability vary the external source activity in order to maximize tracer quantification while minimizing the unavoidable degradation to patient tracer image noise, caused by the introduction of any external source, will be produced. The innovation is an attenuation correction strategy that greatly mitigates the limitations of previous joint reconstruction methods to deliver quantitative PET diagnostics that are expected to match those of silver standard CT approaches. This is significant because the number of patients receiving brain and cardiac PET-CT scans, exams the proposed method is expected to benefit, is steadily increasing. For PET-MR, the method may improve tracer quantification where MR has limited performance and increase patient throughput by eliminating the need for non-diagnostic attenuation-only MR acquisitions. Thus, the proposed strategy has great potential to significantly improve radiological decision- making and clinical trial findings that rely on quantitative PET uptake measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because the development of a PET radiotracer attenuation correction strategy that is independent of the exam type, has the potential to improve the strength of research and clinical findings based on quantitative PET measurements. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIBIB's mission that pertains to enhancing existing imaging and bioengineering modalities.",Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging,10222671,R03EB028946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radioactive', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Source', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Tube', 'attenuation', 'base', 'data quality', 'experimental study', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'patient safety', 'pediatric patients', 'prototype', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2021,86474
"Accuracy and Precision in CT Quantification of COPD Through Virtual Imaging Trials Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death. Increasing in prevalence, COPD is a major burden to patients and providers. Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information about the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where quantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study has recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in evaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different scanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and harmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners. This goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical phantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD patients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not fully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across different scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed radiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where studies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable and practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners. Such models are currently lacking in the context of COPD. We develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT biomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. We develop the first library of realistic COPD patient models with diverse attributes and severities. Coupled with accurate models of different scanners, the phantoms will be used to generate sets of ground-truth-known virtual CT cases, to be disseminated to the research community and to be used to systematically evaluate the effects of current and emerging scanners, various patient attributes, and the effects of image processing algorithms (through a national challenge), on the accuracy and precision of COPD biomarkers. Further, we develop and optimize a truth-based artificial intelligence-based algorithm for COPD quantifications. We optimize the algorithm for accuracy and reproducibility, taking advantage of the ground-truth known simulated images . We then harmonize CT settings across different scanners to accurately and precisely assess COPD imaging biomarkers for both single time-point and longitudinal studies. The studies will be done for the top two image processing algorithms, identified in the challenge, as well as our developed algorithm. Through these efforts, the project will position CT as a more reliable method for improved characterization and monitoring of COPD. Narrative The project aims to systematically evaluate and optimize quantitative CT imaging biomarkers in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, across scanner makes and models, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. This will be performed by developing and using in silico models of COPD patients and CT scanners.

"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,10168531,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,724046
"Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging Abstract  The relatively small axial field-of-view (FOV) in almost all PET scanners has severely limited their sensitivity and resulted in significant tradeoffs between image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), acquisition time, and delivered dose. The solution is to improve geometric coverage using large axial FOV for total-body imaging which has the potential to improve sensitivity by about 40 times compared to existing commercial whole-body PET scanners. The construction of the world's first total-body PET/CT scan-ner, called EXPLORER, with 194-cm axial FOV has recently been completed. However, it has a poor time-of-flight (TOF) resolution of 430 ps, compared to the state-of-the-art whole-body PET scanner with 200 ps timing resolution (Siemens Biograph Vision). In addition, axial detector penetration of obliquely incident gamma photons detected within this wide acceptance angle will introduce significant depth-of-interaction (DOI) parallax error, leading to degraded spatial resolution. These two major defi-ciencies of the EXPLORER scanner offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs such as the human brain when compared to the Biograph Vision PET scanner. For this research, we propose to build cost-effective block detectors with combined highest spatial resolution (2 mm), highest TOF resolution (<120 ps and potentially 100 ps), best DOI localization (1.85 mm), and highest inter- crystal Compton scatter recovery capabilities (88%) using single-ended readout and machine learning post-processing engines. Our novel detector module, called Prism-PET, enables these capabilities by mimicking very closely the behavior of dual-ended readout with enhanced and controlled light sharing using a segmented array of right angle prism-mirror light guides. Given our promising preliminary ex-perimental results, we aim to accomplish the following tasks: (1) model a prototype TOF-DOI PET scanner using GATE Monte Carlo simulations and use its list-mode data to develop our TOF-DOI image recontruction; (2) build Prism-PET detector modules and characterize coincidence detector blocks for DOI-corrected spatial resolution, energy resolution, and timing resolution and use machine learning to recover inter-crystal Compton scattered events to reach the 2-mm intrinsic spatial resolution without sacrificing sensitivity; (3) Build a one-ring prototype Prism-PET scanner; (4) perform normalization scan, optimize our image reconstruction using experimental coincidence events and validate the optimal imaging performance using Hot Spot phantoms. Our proposed TOF-DOI-Compton detector and system technologies maximize the sensitivity benefits of improved geometric coverage in total-body PET scanners across the entire FOV. Narratives/Relevance  The EXPLORER total-body PET scanner has limitations due to its poor timing resolution and lack of DOI-encoding, both of which offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs, despite the very costly improvement of its geometric coverage. In the proposed work we will develop cost-effective and practical single-ended TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector modules, where these capabilities are enabled by using our novel right an-gle prism mirror light guides which enhance (1) light sharing by efficient 180-degree bending of photon paths and (2) crystal identification by localiz-ing the shared photons to only those immediate neighboring pixels that help with the correct identification. Our Prism-PET scanner with < 120 ps timing resolution, 1.85 mm DOI-encoding, and 88% Compton-scatter recovery miti-gates the limitations with the EXPLORER total-body scanner and achieves unparalleled spatial resolution and sensitivity.",Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging,10233306,R01EB030413,"['Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Collaborations', 'Compton radiation', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Floods', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Industrialization', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'detector', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk mitigation', 'simulation']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,647165
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies.

"MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers SUMMARY The importance of biomarkers in clinical practice and regulatory science is difficult to overstate. The ultimate goal for clinical care of the future is to determine the most appropriate therapy for each patient’s unique version of a particular disease. This concept of precision medicine has been identified as a national priority in the USA, leading to a need for biomarkers that can provide objective and reproducible information. In addition, regulatory science for the approval of new qualified drugs and medical technologies has an urgent need for qualified biomarkers to report on the success or failure of these drugs and technologies. Imaging biomarkers, providing in situ “biopsies”, have the potential to provide such specific information and, ultimately, to improve routine clinical care and speed up development of new treatments. The overall goal of this Resource therefore is to develop novel noninvasive MRI candidate biomarkers that can ultimately be used for: (i) personalized assessment of patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring; (ii) monitoring of the development of new medical technologies and drugs, i.e. for better guiding of clinical trials. The significance of our proposed developments lies in providing the fundamental design and initial testing (i.e. not clinical trials itself) of new MRI candidate biomarkers with the potential to provide surrogate quantitative imaging endpoints that are as close as possible to clinical endpoints. As such, this Resource will focus on designing, calibrating and standardizing new magnetic resonance (MR) technologies to provide reliable measures across sessions, scanners, and raters. This technology will then be disseminated for larger scale patient studies to allow clinical validation.  The MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary consortium combining facilities and expertise of the F.M. Kirby Research Center at Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), the Department of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine, the Center for Imaging Science at the JHU Whiting School of Engineering, and the Department of Biostatistics at the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health. We propose 4 TRD projects, 3 on MR acquisition approaches and one bringing them together with advanced multi-scale data analysis methods that include machine learning. To assure a proper choice of technologies, we will interact closely with a group of clinical and research experts in a push-pull relationship through collaborative projects (CPs) that focus on brain diseases, disorders, and injuries that have a need for new quantitative MR technology to better and noninvasively assess them. These include anemia/ischemia and related white matter hyperintensity lesions (CPs 1,5), aging, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia (CPs 2,7,10), traumatic brain injury (CP4), glymphatic function (CP6), pain (CP8) and addiction (CP9). As an initial testbed for our methods, we also have a group of service projects (SPs) to which we will provide both data acquisition methods and data analysis software. Finally, we will train investigators in their use and disseminate methods nationwide and to MRI manufacturers for even broader application.

"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics.

"Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease Project Summary: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has a prevalence of over 800,000 in the US alone. The economic impact is disproportionally high because it affects primarily young individuals. The characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent hospitalizations. There has been a recent shift in clinical practice from a reactive to a proactive CD treatment strategy, recently coined as “treat-to-target”, where patients are treated to achieve not only an initial response-to-therapy, but also longer clinical remissions and improved mucosal healing. However, this approach requires the regular assessment of disease activity using objective markers enabling treatments to be tailored to the individual patient. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new tools to improve diagnostic accuracy, to quantify disease burden, and to monitor treatment efficacy. Our application in response to PAR-19-056, “Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn's disease” is aimed at developing and evaluating noninvasive, contrast and radiation-free quantitative imaging markers for assessing disease activity and for monitoring response to therapy. Currently available non-contrast MR imaging (MRI) sequences such as diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and the calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are attractive but limited in providing robust and reproducible markers. Different imaging protocols or different scanners result in different ADC values. Our primary goal is to develop robust and reliable quantitative DW-MR imaging markers for the non-contrast and non-invasive assessment of CD. The proposed novel MRI acquisition and model fitting techniques will provide measurements of slow and fast diffusion as well as fraction of fast diffusion, as highly accurate, quantitative biomarkers for cell proliferation, density and size, and tissue perfusion—all indices that characterize the extent of disease activity (i.e., inflammation) in the tissue micro-structure of the bowel. To achieve this goal, we will first develop and implement an advanced distortion and motion corrected (DiMoCo) DW-MRI technique and a spatially constrained probabilistic intravoxel incoherent motion (SPIM) model to compute robust and reproducible markers. Next, we will reduce the imaging time with estimated x4 acceleration with an accelerated image acquisition and a new, advanced deep learning-based parameter estimation technique. The proposed imaging techniques and software tools will provide robust quantitative markers, thereby enabling the accurate assessment of CD activity and response to therapy. They will also reduce the need for invasive endoscopy procedures as well as the total number of other tests typically ordered for monitoring disease, effectively reducing both the disease burden and the overall cost of healthcare. Another important goal is to develop and broadly disseminate open source software that will enable the standardized evaluation of other diseases presently evaluated with DW-MRI that would benefit from the advanced diagnostic and assessment capabilities of the proposed DiMoCo SPIM-DW-MRI technique. Project Narrative: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that impacts over 800,000 patients in the US alone, where characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent, costly hospitalizations and symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, general malaise, and fever significantly compromise quality of life. There is a need for new tools aimed at the reliable assessment of disease activity by using objective markers to improve diagnostic accuracy, quantify disease burden, and monitor treatment efficacy, enabling subsequent treatments tailored to the individual patient's disease profile. The primary objective of this project is three-fold: First, to develop and validate a novel, noninvasive, contrast- and radiation-free quantitative MR imaging and image analysis technique, i.e., DiMoCo-SPIM that will generate robust and reproducible imaging markers from DW-MRI that will enable clinicians to more accurately assess bowel inflammation and response to therapy; second, to develop a machine learning technique that reduces the imaging time (x4 acceleration); and third, to make image analysis software developed in this proposal available in multiple clinical domains that presently evaluate various diseases with MRI and would benefit from the improved diagnostic and assessment capabilities of this computationally-driven technique.",Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease,10121764,R01DK125561,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Acceleration', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Coin', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease remission', 'Endoscopy', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Evaluation', 'Fever', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhagic colitis', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiration', 'Safety', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell motility', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical remission', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diffusion weighted', 'economic impact', 'efficacy evaluation', 'healing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'water diffusion']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,391320
"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using 3T and 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health across different tissues in osteoarthritis.",Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI,10190939,R01EB002524,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Cartilage', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GAG Gene', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Orthopedics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Proteoglycan', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'clinical application', 'clinical examination', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'efficacy trial', 'imaging approach', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mechanical properties', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,611185
"Super-Resolution Tau PET Imaging for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (the presymptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s disease) is characterized by pathophysiological changes without measurable cognitive decline and begins decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease research is in pressing need of new biomarker endpoints to enable disease monitoring before traditional cognitive endpoints are measurable. The overarching research objectives of this R03 Small Project Grant are to develop a super-resolution (SR) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging framework for tau (a pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease) and to assess the clinical utility of localized outcome measures obtained from SR PET images. Studies show that tau pathology in the medial temporal lobe is an important marker of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. Cohorts focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s now incorporate serialized 18F-flortaucipir PET scans for longitudinal tracking of tau accumulation in key anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs). The quantitative accuracy of tau PET, however, is degraded by the limited spatial resolution capabilities of PET, which lead to inter-ROI spillover and partial volume effects. The problem is further compounded in studies spanning several decades, many of which were commenced on legacy scanners with even lower resolution capabilities than the current state of the art. Additionally, many longitudinal studies began on older scanners and later transitioned to newer models posing a multi-scanner data harmonization challenge. The proposed SR framework will perform a mapping from a low- resolution scanner’s image domain to a high-resolution scanner’s image domain and enable PET resolution recovery and data harmonization. Underlying the proposed framework is a neural network model that can be adversarially trained in self-supervised mode without requiring paired input/output image samples for training. This critical feature ensures practical clinical utility of the method as the need for paired low-resolution and high- resolution datasets from the same subject with similar tracer dose and scan settings is a major barrier for the clinical translatability of simpler supervised alternatives for SR. The proposed network, although trained using unpaired clinical data, receives guidance from an ancillary neural network separately pretrained using paired simulation datasets. For this purpose, we will synthesize paired low- and high-resolution images from a series of digital tau phantoms that will be created for this project. Training and validation of the self-supervised SR framework will be performed via secondary use of de-identified 18F-flortaucipir PET scans from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a longitudinal cohort focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. We will evaluate SR performance using a variety of image quality metrics. To assess the clinical utility of localized super-resolution measures, we will perform cross-sectional statistical power analyses that estimate sample sizes per arm needed to power clinical trials. Accurate localized measures of tau generated by this project could enable early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and facilitate ongoing clinical trials by reducing sample sizes required for a given effect size. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this R03 Small Project Grant is to develop methods for generating high-resolution images of abnormal tau protein tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. This will be achieved by building a self-supervised super-resolution framework based on a deep neural network for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tau. The proposed imaging technique can facilitate early diagnosis and accurate monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease.",Super-Resolution Tau PET Imaging for Alzheimer's Disease,10118776,R03AG070750,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'drug development', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'pre-clinical', 'radioligand', 'radiotracer', 'rate of change', 'response', 'simulation', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau mutation']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R03,2021,151980
"Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury Abstract This project aims to release our recently gathered existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE affects 1-5/1000 term-born neonates and is a major cause of early-childhood mortality and morbidity. Neonatal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is acquired routinely for the clinical care of HIE. Neonatal brain MRI is expected to reveal 3D neuroanatomic mechanisms of adverse outcomes so that we can design new treatments specifically target those mechanisms. Neonatal brain MRI also carries hope to identify those neonates who are at risk to develop adverse outcomes later in life, so that early intervention program can target those at-risk neonates for maximum benefit. Despite MRI's vital role in caring for HIE, the current norm in clinical practice is to read MRI visually by expert neuroradiologist or neurologist. Expert reads, however, has many limitations – subjective, qualitative, insufficient to reveal mechanisms, and inadequate to predict outcomes. Objective and quantitative analysis of MRI is possible with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical and neuroimaging informatics. A major limitation, however, is the lack of publicly-available data on HIE. Our project aims to fill this gap, by archiving and releasing our clinically-acquired, large-scale (N=231), and multi-site (2 hospitals) data on HIE. Our data was acquired partly funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and foundations (2016-2020). Our data is comprehensive, including clinical data elements (from both mothers and neonates), neonatal brain MRI (structural and diffusion sequences), expert-consensus annotation of lesion regions in neonatal brain MRI, NICU outcome (death/survival, length of stay), and 2-year-old neurocognitive outcomes (normal/adverse, yes/no for development dealy, yes/no for the hearing/visual/motor impairment, and yes/no for cerebral palsy). Our data is also representative, coming from patients with different racial/ethnicity groups, in patients with a wide range of outcomes, from different MRI scanners (Siemens 3T or GE 1.5T), with different imaging protocols, and MRI scanned on different days of life. We will also derive new data from existing data. The anonymized (de-identified) data will be released to the NCBI dbGaP platform with the “Controlled Access” option, requiring IRB and data use agreement (DUA). The derived data will be released to dbGaP with the “Open Access” option, freely downloadable without any approval. Both release options are consistent with other clinical and MRI data that have already been released on dbGaP. We hope this first comprehensive data will boost future collaborative efforts for AI to automatically identify HIE lesions in MRI, and for AI to accurately predict HIE outcome integrating clinical and MRI information. Project Narrative We aim to publicly release our existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal brain injury caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our data were retrospectively collected partially funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and two other foundational/institutional grant (2016-2020); our data is comprehensive (clinical data from mothers and neonates, neonatal brain MRI with expert-consensus annotations of HIE lesions, and complete set of outcome measures by 2 years of age); our data is representative (MRI scanner, age at MRI, MRI protocol, patient outcomes, patient racial/ethnicity groups); and our data is multi-site (2 hospitals) and large-scale (N=231 compared to proprietary studies with dozens of patients). We plan to use this first public clinical and brain MRI data for HIE to boost artificial intelligence (AI) research for HIE lesion detection and outcome prediction, toward promoting outcomes in this vulnerable neonatal population.",Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury,10194889,R03HD104891,"['2 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Authorization documentation', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child Health', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ethnic group', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hospitals', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metadata', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Brain Injury', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study of magnetics', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'cranium', 'data access', 'data de-identification', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'early childhood', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention program', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'motor impairment', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient registry', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'visual motor']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2021,94911
