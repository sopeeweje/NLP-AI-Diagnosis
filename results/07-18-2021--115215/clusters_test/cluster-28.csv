"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short- to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one- third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third-order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARS- CoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach",10195454,R21LM013683,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Judgment', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protective Agents', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Shock', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Vision', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'cyclooxygenase 1', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'demographics', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'global health emergency', 'high risk', 'human data', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insurance claims', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label use', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'preclinical study', 'prophylactic', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'public health emergency', 'sex']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R21,2021,1
"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,10202634,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,322545
"Sex differences in the neural correlates underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution in cocaine addiction National studies show that drug use rates have increased in the last decade among women, comprising a major public health concern in the US. However, women are greatly underrepresented in neuroimaging studies, and the paucity of studies that explicitly target sex comparisons in addicted populations contributes to a gap in the study of the sex specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. Over the last decade, in a series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies (conducted with previous support including R01DA023579, R01DA020949), we have thoroughly mapped the clinical symptoms of cocaine addiction to the neural networks underlying impairments in Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA). This model proposes that the drug assumes heightened salience at the expense of non-drug related reinforcement as associated with abnormalities in reward processing and concomitant decreases in inhibitory control, together increasing addiction severity (including craving, a proxy of relapse) in susceptible individuals. The iRISA model highlights the role of the dopaminergically innervated prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections to mesolimbic and striatal subcortical regions as assessed functionally and structurally. However, the majority of this neuroimaging research has been accomplished in male individuals with cocaine use disorders (iCUD). In the current project we aim to expand the reach of iRISA by comparing equal numbers of male to female iCUD; to test this model’s generalizability (vs. drug specificity effects), we will also include individuals with opioid use disorder (iOUD). We will conduct functional MRI during reward processing, inhibitory control and cue-reactivity tasks, and, to inspect generalizability of results beyond task-related activations, during resting-state. Beyond functional activations and connectivity, anatomical scans will assess the underlying gray matter integrity. Across all aims, healthy controls will be included to establish norms. We hypothesize female iCUD to differ from male iCUD, or female controls, in a pattern indicative of enhanced vulnerability to iRISA inclusive of compensatory PFC activations and abnormalities in structural measures; iCUD vs. iOUD comparisons will be exploratory. The novelty of this proposal is further enhanced by an exploratory aim to compare, in a within- subjects design, menstrual cycle (and hormonal) effects and by developing sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to incorporate data from all imaging modalities to yield an automated group classification and addiction severity (including craving) prediction tool. Considering that the majority of research in addiction occurs in males, clarification of the sex differences in the neural underpinnings of iRISA could reinforce the importance of studying both genders and suggest that different treatment strategies may be effective in women (potentially of most impact when timed vis-à-vis menstrual cycle), contributing to the development of tailored (gender-based) treatment options. Including equal numbers of women and men would advance basic studies of drug addiction and ultimately save resources by minimizing cost and adverse effects in future clinical trials. National studies show that there is more rapid increase in the use of all drugs of abuse by women compared with men, comprising a unique public health concern in the US. However, an overrepresentation of males in neuroimaging studies, and a paucity of studies that explicitly target sex comparisons in addicted populations, contributes to an absence of a clear understanding of sex specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. The study of sex differences (and menstrual cycle/hormonal effects) in the neural underpinnings of reward processing, inhibitory control and cue-reactivity could advance basic neuroscience studies of drug addiction and save resources by minimizing cost and adverse effects during future clinical (medication) trials. Ultimately, results could contribute to the development of individually tailored (gender-based) precision medicine interventions (e.g., to reduce craving).",Sex differences in the neural correlates underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution in cocaine addiction,10131173,R01DA048301,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Anatomy', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Epidemic', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Intoxication', 'Luteal Phase', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Menstrual cycle', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proxy', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'design', 'drug of abuse', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'men', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'non-drug', 'opioid use disorder', 'precision medicine', 'psychostimulant', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress reactivity', 'symptomatology', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,689316

"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies will create a new powerful technology for accelerated antibiotic development targeting diverse bacteria and give rise to new families of antibiotics.",Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development,10094184,R01AI136799,"['Address', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemistry', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Efflux', 'Drug Modelings', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Penetration', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Walkers', 'antibiotic efflux', 'base', 'cell envelope', 'clinical investigation', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'experimental analysis', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistant strain', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'uptake']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2021,1106111

"Transcriptome-driven inference of adverse drug interactions ABSTRACT Ototoxicity is a debilitating side effect of over 150 medications, many of which are prescribed as part of multi- drug regimens to treat a broad range of conditions including cancer and recalcitrant infections. Adverse drug- drug interactions (DDIs) that potentiate ototoxicity complicate the implementation of multi-drug regimens, particularly to treat multiple concurrent conditions. In most cases, DDIs are currently detected only after the drugs are on the market, so effective preclinical methods to identify potential adverse interactions would facilitate safer co-prescriptions. The astronomical number of combinations renders measuring all possible drug interactions infeasible, so predicting how ototoxic drugs interact from data of individual compounds is necessary. While the current understanding of mechanisms underlying ototoxicity of specific drug classes has helped to explain clinical observations of specific adverse ototoxicity DDIs, and aided rational design of candidate otoprotective adjuvants, this strategy cannot anticipate adverse ototoxicity DDIs or develop otoprotectants for other lesser studied drug classes and first-in-class drugs under clinical development. To survey more broadly for potential ototoxicity DDIs, we will adapt INDIGO (Inferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning tool that currently can predict synergy/antagonism of antimicrobial drug activity in multiple bacterial species without requiring specific drug target information. We hypothesize that we can harness the underlying approach to predict potentially adverse (synergistic) or protective (antagonistic) ototoxic DDIs in humans, by building an “INDIGO-Tox” model based on data generated from an appropriate animal system. We will measure transcriptional profiles elicited by 15 drugs known to convey ototoxicity or otoprotection, as well as corresponding pairwise ototoxicity DDI phenotypes in zebrafish, a well-established in vivo model system for studying ototoxicity. We will use these data to train INDIGO-Tox model. We will then use INDIGO-Tox to predict DDIs between 10 additional drugs, using their zebrafish transcriptome response profiles as input data. We will validate predictions in zebrafish, and will test translation of top validated predictions in a well-established mouse ex vivo model of ototoxicity. We will also use the model to generate predictions for novel genes that influence ototoxicity, which we will then test in zebrafish. Successful completion will generate hypotheses for translation into humans, facilitate model expansion to assessing possible ototoxic interactions for a broader library of drugs, and will establish a path to predict interactions between ototoxicity and other organ toxicities. N AR R AT IVE Drug-induced hearing injury is a debilitating, often irreversible side-effect of certain lifesaving medicines that are often prescribed as part of multi-drug regimens. As adverse drug-drug interactions can exacerbate ototoxicity, novel effective preclinical methods to identify potential interactions would facilitate safer co- prescriptions. Here we propose to develop and validate a computational tool, INDIGO-Tox, to predict ototoxic drug-drug interactions and identify genes that influence these interactions.",Transcriptome-driven inference of adverse drug interactions,9880239,R21DC018341,"['Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Models', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Hair Cells', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Labyrinth', 'Larva', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Sampling', 'Stains', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Zebrafish', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'clinical development', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'human model', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'knock-down', 'lateral line', 'loss of function', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'otoprotectant', 'ototoxicity', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDCD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,186000
"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules or cellular features, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. In Phase I of this proposal, we combined the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform. We screened ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes on two cell lines. This dataset was compared to a matching dataset from the pioneering project for D4, the Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. In Phase I, we observed that from both a technical and biological utility standpoint, the metabolomics data provided an orthogonal dataset with signal fidelity, sensitivity, and relevance to compound properties comparable to or exceeding the Connectivity Map. Further, we saw high concordance of plasma metabolite changes in type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis patients with in vitro metabolite changes of related drugs used for those indications. Thus, these results suggest that a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform is not only viable as a complementary dataset to the Connectivity Map, but that metabolomics data can even play a primary role in drug discovery. In this Phase II proposal, we will focus on profiling chemical and genetic perturbations in vitro to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating genetically defined rare diseases. We will expand data generation to ~3300 bioactive compounds across three cell lines. Further, we will profile 50 genetic knockouts on those three cell lines to model in vitro the associated rare diseases. Using Sinopia’s platform, we will select compounds for follow-up evaluation to identify candidates that correct for metabolic dysregulations seen in those rare diseases. Successful in vitro programs will aid in seeding of an early stage discovery pipeline that will be advanced through funding by private investment, patient advocacy groups, and additional federal grants. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we have built a unique platform focused on understanding the use of metabolomics in drug discovery.

"Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies Chemical warfare and the use of mustard gas on civilian population poses a major risk. Vesicating agents, such as mustard gas, cause severe damage to the corneas that can result in blindness and severe loss of sight. There are currently limited therapeutic options for treatment of damage caused by vesicating agents. To enable the rapid development of much needed medical countermeasures, the proposed work will test the possibility of drug repurposing. Drug repurposing strategies are based on the identification of new uses for existing drugs. Drug repurposing is a demonstrated successful strategy that can lower the cost of drug development and reduce development time. The key challenge in drug repurposing is the need to identify novel drug-disease relationships. To address this challenge we will deploy a set of innovative microscopy approaches that will provide rich data on the subtle aspects of the impact existing drugs have on corneal healing from chemical injury. Specifically, in Aim #1 we will perform a chemical screen of 770 existing drugs using live, organ culture, image-based assay. Mice corneas will be imaged for 48 hours after wound and sophisticated computer vision algorithm will be used to extract data on stem cell proliferation, cell death, cell migration, and wound closure. In Aim #2 we will construct spatiotemporal cornea-specific cell atlas of migration, proliferation, inflammatory signaling and gene expression response to chemical injury for controls, and drug-treated corneas. The cell atlases will provide a key resource on the process of chemical injury, the mechanism of action of existing therapies, and the mechanism of action of the most promising new drugs identified in Aim #1. Collectively, the results of this work will exploit the possibility of drug repurposing for the treatment of ocular injury caused by vesicants. The resource we will generate, i.e .the information on existing drugs and the detailed cell atlases of the process of healing will build the foundation for the rapid future development of much needed medical countermeasures. Chemical weapons such as mustard gas can cause severe damage to the eye and lead to blindness. Here we will use sophisticated microscopy tools to test how does the eye heal when treating by existing FDA approved drugs and generate an atlas of the cellular response to chemical injury. Our results will support efforts to repurpose existing drugs to provide much needed medical countermeasures to combat chemical warfare.",Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies,10137251,R21EY031283,"['Accidents', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Chemical Weapons', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'End Point Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Injuries', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mechlorethamine', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mustard Gas', 'Organ', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Type I Epithelial Receptor Cell', 'Vesicants', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'combat', 'corneal epithelial wound healing', 'corneal regeneration', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'first responder', 'healing', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical countermeasure', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'response', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell proliferation', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment effect', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,218032
"Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use,10073490,R00DA042127,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tweens', 'Work', 'adolescent drug use', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'career', 'design', 'drug abuse prevention', 'flexibility', 'girls', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'residence', 'societal costs', 'successful intervention']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2021,313933
"Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy Project Summary The WHO approved 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) has been found non-inferior to 6H in preventing TB reactivation and achieves higher completion rates. The National TB program in Uganda is currently transitioning from 6HP to 3HP which will be scaled up starting in Jan 2021. Rifapentine has not been widely used in Uganda outside clinical trials and therefore its safety profile in programmatic setting in adults and children is still uncertain. Accurate profiling of patients likely to experience 3HP related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has the potential to improve TPT completion rates, and in turn improve TB control. Our proposal seeks to describe safety profiles of 3HP, completion rates and the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of 3HP-related ADRs for people receiving TPT at programmatic level. This study will take place in five health facilities in Uganda in collaboration with the National TB program and the National Drug Authority. We will conduct a cohort study where 614 adults and children >2 years, who have been initiated on 3HP for TPT by the facility clinician according to standard of care will be enrolled. Participants will be both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected. Participants will be followed up monthly for evaluation for ADRs using a standardized questionnaires, clinical evaluation and laboratory tests (liver function testing). For a subset of 300 patients (150 cases who develop grade 2 and above ADRs and 150 controls who do not experience ADRs), we will conduct pharmacokinetic sampling to measure rifapentine and isoniazid concentrations and selected genotyping (for examples N-Acetyl Transferase, Cytochrome 2E1) and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. We will use pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic-pharmacodynamic models and stochastic gradient boosted machine learning together with conventional statistical methods to determine factors associated with ADRs and simple prediction rules for the identification of patients at high risk for ADR. We will also determine the effect of the ADRs on TPT completion rates. Patients will subsequently be followed up for up to 3 years and assessed for TB reactivation according to standard of care to determine the incidence of TB reactivation in patients who have received 3HP and the risk factors for this. This study will provide data on the safety of 3HP during national roll-out and provide information on who is likely to develop ADRs which can affect treatment completion and therefore may benefit from alternative regimens. Study Narrative: This project will describe the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of adverse drug reactions among people receiving 3HP for TPT in Uganda. The results of this study will inform clinical decisions for identifying patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions related to 3HP in the African setting.",Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy,10217331,R01AI160434,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Cytochromes', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health care facility', 'Hypotension', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Interruption', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Questionnaires', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transferase', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'Vision', 'World Health Organization', 'adverse drug reaction', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'authority', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'flu', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'human leukocyte antigen testing', 'improved', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'pharmacodynamic model', 'prevent', 'programs', 'reactivation from latency', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'rifapentine', 'scale up', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'uptake']",NIAID,INFECTIOUS DISEASES INSTITUTE,R01,2021,138370
"Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients ABSTRACT Pregnant people are a vulnerable population: healthcare professionals must exercise caution in prescribing many common pharmaceuticals to expectant patients, given potential risk of injury to a developing fetus. Arguably, teratogenicity is the most serious manifestation of fetal toxicity, as teratogens lead to fetal malformation and are implicated in physical and mental disabilities throughout the life course of an affected child. Consideration of teratogenicity, however, is a largely nonsystematic process. While regulatory agencies like the United States Food and Drug Administration have established discrete teratogenicity scores for evaluating drug safety, these classification criteria provide little concrete distinction among score classes, making it difficult for pharmaceutical scientists to systematically determine the teratogenic potential of a drug. This effect ripples to the bedside, as providers lack robust data on most drugs to inform their judgements of safety, efficacy, and risk in recommending therapies to expectant patients. Consequently, treatment of many diseases during pregnancy remains understudied and uncertain, for fear of causing harm. To address these shortcomings and improve quality of care for pregnant patients and their unborn children, we propose the development of a holistic, generalizable framework for the identification of teratogenic drug exposures via a new paradigm of clinical pharmacovigilance. Therefore, given our inability to evaluate drug safety in pregnant patients in real time, the objective of our investigation is to develop an observational platform to uncover new drug safety information through strategic, associative analysis of medication history within the electronic health record (EHR) of a pregnant patient and developmental diseases within the EHRs of their neonates. This approach will harness 48,434 linked maternal and neonatal EHRs within the Research Derivative, a databank of identified EHRs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, across which we plan to apply and appropriately validate a medication-wide association study to uncover new, data-driven associations between maternal medication exposures and teratogenic health outcomes. To date, we have employed this technique to discover 129 associations between maternal drug exposure and neurodevelopmental diseases from existing primary care data, which recapitulate teratogens well-known to clinical practice that also serve as positive controls for our model. Now, we hope to expand our platform to encompass more advanced techniques of clinical trial emulation; if successful, we anticipate that discovering new toxicants through retrospective data modeling will greatly enhance our goal of systematically clarifying cases of suspect drug safety in pregnancy. In the long run, we hope this approach will allow clinicians to embrace a more accurate knowledge base in their evaluation of the risks and benefits in prescribing drugs with unclear teratogenic risks to their pregnant patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE From the perspective of regulatory agencies for public health and safety, it is unethical to perform clinical trials on pregnant people to assess drug safety and efficacy for the treatment of diseases of pregnancy; paradoxically, while this policy recognizes the vulnerability of an expectant mother and her unborn child, it has created a public health emergency for millions of pregnant patients, as clinicians lack robust data on treatments for these conditions and still do not know whether many common drugs are safe to prescribe to their pregnant patients. To address these problems, this project aims to harness the burgeoning science of machine learning to create a surrogate for randomized, controlled drug trials in pregnant populations, via the development of a “target trial” platform to discover new drug safety and efficacy insights from medication and disease data in linked maternal and neonatal electronic health records that were originally collected during routine medical care. Upon completion of this project, pharmaceutical scientists may employ the resulting target trial framework to clarify drug safety concerns for pregnant patients, and clinicians may benefit more definitive data in their choice of safe and effective medications for expectant mothers.",Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients,10232840,R21HD105304,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Birth', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Fetal Development', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infant Care', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Orphan', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Thalidomide', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Upper Extremity', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'human data', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'loss of function', 'malformation', 'medication safety', 'neonate', 'novel therapeutics', 'pharmacovigilance', 'phenome', 'point of care', 'preclinical study', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'simulation', 'toxicant', 'unborn child', 'unethical']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,259500
"Computational prediction of gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism Project Summary / Abstract Notwithstanding pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials performed to identify efficacy, side effects, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), only 25-60% of patients respond favorably to prescribed drugs, leading to a cost of $30-$130 billion in the US annually. ADRs are partially attributed to the gut microbiome, i.e. the complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome interacts with different types of xenobiotics including drugs, resulting in biotransformation of therapeutics into metabolites with altered disposition, efficacy, and toxicity. Gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism leads to non-effective treatments as well as teratogenic, toxic, and lethal effects that in some cases were not recognized until the drug was on the market. As a result, leading pharmaceutical researchers have begun to recognize that the role of gut microbiome in drug metabolism should be accounted for in attempts to improve treatment effectiveness. However, despite extensive progress in gut microbiome research, there is currently no reliable, cost-effective approach to integrate gut-mediated drug metabolism in drug development pipelines. This Phase I proposal aims to address this challenge by developing a new computational platform with the ability to predict microbial metabolism of therapeutic drugs and to leverage that information to enhance drug design and development. We will employ a range of state-of-the-art computational biology techniques to reliably screen for microorganisms that may metabolize the target drugs. The novelty of this project lies in the ability to screen drug-metabolizing enzymes/microorganisms using multiple metrics and methods to increase the reliability of predictions to achieve the accuracy necessary for clinical and commercial use. This multi- method platform will be built, integrated, and validated in an iterative fashion using targeted in vitro experiments on two candidate drugs, i.e. the anti-arrhythmic drug amiodarone and the anti-viral drug famciclovir. This project is designed to both advance our current understanding of microbiome function in the context of drug-gut interactions as well as inform strategies to help enhance public health and economic growth. The value proposition of this project includes leveraging publicly available bioinformatics databases as well as advances in computational biology techniques to develop a more precise, reliable, and inexpensive tool for gut microbiome-mediated metabolism of therapeutic drugs. This in-silico platform could be employed for both current drugs as well as drugs under development. For current drugs, this platform can help increase the safety of drugs by predicting the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity as they may differ from individual-to- individual. For new drugs, the platform would reduce the cost and timeframe of drug development, while increasing the effectiveness of the therapeutics themselves.

"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,10092137,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,460884
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,10074602,R44TR002528,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Ally', 'Books', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Commercial Catalogs', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'male', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2021,750747
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,10197115,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,10141255,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,291940
"Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The availability of high-throughput, low-cost sequencing has transformed the landscape of biomedical research by dramatically expanding our capacity to interrogate the sequence of the human genome. Consequently, there has been an explosion of biomedical literature describing the role of specific genomic variants and their impact on human diseases. These advances are bringing sequencing into the clinic to shape clinical practice from the patient’s genomic content, a paradigm colloquially referred to as genomic or precision medicine. There remain many obstacles to fully realizing our potential in the era of precision medicine. Among them is a recognized need for robust, well-engineered systems that provide knowledge about genomic variants and their role in disease. Ideally, such systems would provide a comprehensive summary of all knowledge that is relevant to the patient’s unique genomic content. An early bottleneck to realizing precision medicine was that, despite the substantial literature and several established knowledgebases that define interactions between drugs and genes, querying across them was extremely challenging. In response to this need, the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb, dgidb.org) was developed. Through a combination of automated processing and manual curation, drug-gene interaction information was collected, structured, and connected (normalized) from these diverse sources of data and entered into a database with a user-friendly search interface and an application programming interface (API). However, linking drug and drug-gene interaction concepts across resources remains an extremely challenging task, and aggregated drug-gene interactions are also challenging to represent in a way that highlights the utility of the collected knowledge for precision medicine efforts. This proposal seeks to improve our ability to normalize and interpret drug-gene interactions corresponding to patient genomic variants. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims. First, the DGIdb normalization routines will be improved through incorporation of new content and features. Among these, the DGIdb will support collections of drugs, including combination therapies and drug classes. Also, the DGIdb will have new community submission and curation features, allowing users to incorporate new knowledge into the database. Second, the Variant Interpretation Aggregator database (VIAdb) will be created to normalize knowledge across several disparate sources focused on the clinical interpretations of genomic variants. The VIAdb will operate as a stand-alone web tool and API and will behave as a source of relevant interpretations to DGIdb. Finally, we will develop techniques for automated identification of drug-gene interactions and variant interpretation consensus to assist community curation efforts. If successful, this research will improve breadth and consistency of variant interpretations and drug-gene interactions for precision medicine efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will improve our ability to interpret genomic variations in human patients in support of precision medicine efforts. Specifically, it will provide web-based tools for identifying potential therapies that specifically target the patient’s individual genes or variants, and an assessment of the clinical actionability of those drugs.",Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants,10415312,R00HG010157,"['Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center at the Vanderbilt University', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug resource', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'response', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'web app', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R00,2021,249000
"Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types  This proposal outlines the protocols and techniques I will be using to optimize drug discovery of ASCT2, a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics. ASCT2 plays a key role in increasing the glutamine influx for tumor cells to maintain such high metabolic rates required for rapid proliferation. The first structures of ASCT2 were recently determined experimentally, making this a newly viable target for structure-based studies ASCT2 was only recently discovered to play a critical role in cancer cell metabolism and little medicinal chemistry efforts have been focused on ASCT2 antagonist development allowing immense potential for breaking into new compound scaffolds for further testing. Currently, there have not been any ASCT2 drug campaigns that incorporate computational drug discovery methods and this proposal outlines the first studies dedicated to this.  Many institutions and pharmaceutical companies have implemented computational strategies into drug discovery pipelines as a means to produce viable drug candidates in a more cost-efficient and timely manner. Depending on the target of interest, researchers focus more intently on either ligand-based (LB) or structure-based (SB) methods, but rarely are these two methods hybridized in a sophisticated fashion. By utilizing strategies of both LB- and SB- computational drug discovery, I intend to merge the advantages of both methodologies as a means to sample and filter large chemical space more efficiently. Our lab has active development in two computational chemistry software suites: Rosetta primarily focuses on SB methods whereas the Biology and Chemistry Library (BCL) contains advanced cheminformatics toolsets for LB methods. The focus of my project will be to integrate the RosettaDrugDesign code to allow a more extensive, yet efficient sampling of chemical space using ligand-based techniques. We intend to incorporate these more advanced LB techniques available in the BCL, including multi-tasking artificial neural networks for Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationship predictions, to filter compounds during docking simulations within the RosettaDrugDesign. By bringing together the structure prediction abilities of Rosetta and small- molecule tools of BCL, we anticipate exceptional advances in our abilities to efficiently design drugs for ASCT2. Project Narrative The upregulated influx of amino acids is critical to maintain an altered metabolic state for rapidly proliferating cells such as those found in tumors, making transporters such as ASCT2 a promising target for cancer therapeutics. Computational-based drug discovery methods have not been heavily utilized for ASCT2 due to lack of an experimentally determined structure; however with the recently solved structure, these methods are now possible and highly favorable for guiding medicinal chemistry efforts. This proposal outlines the plans for hybridized structure- and ligand-based approaches for computational drug discovery of ASCT2 antagonists and the experimental validation obtained utilizing in silico methods.","Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types",10003012,F31CA243353,"['Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Transporter', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cysteine', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Facility Accesses', 'Formulation', 'Glutamine', 'Homologous Protein', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serine', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computing resources', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'metabolic rate', 'method development', 'multitask', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38247
"A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition Abstract Drug metabolism and disposition are essential xenobiotic responses. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not have protein-coding potentials. Although many of the biological functions of lncRNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how lncRNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance. Through integrative analysis of cancer non-coding genomic and high-through drug screening data of 505 cancer cell lines, our preliminary study have discovered and functionally characterized a group of ADME(drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, whose up-regulation is associated with resistance to more than 100 chemotherapy compounds and may regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters through interacting with xenobiotic nuclear receptor. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs is an important contributor for the development of cancer chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: In Aim 1, we will perform bioinformatic analysis and molecularly clone of lncRNAs associated with cancer chemo-resistance and clinical prognosis. In Aim 2: we will functional characterize of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, using in vivo and in vitro cancer chemotherapy models. In Aim 3: we will determine the mechanism by which ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Chemotherapy remains a mainstay in the clinical management of cancer patients, but chemo-resistance is a major challenge to overcome. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor- mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the development of chemo-resistance. Narrative The goal of this study is to reveal a novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that a group of novel lncRNAs, identified by our computational analysis and experimental validation, can affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs.

"Exploiting convergent evolution to design biomarker extraction tools for the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The effective treatment of drug resistant tumors represents one of the greatest unmet needs in oncology research. The evolution of therapeutic resistance in cancer is a dynamic process, shaped by many external forces, including selection pressures, microenvironment, and the timescales of clinical treatments. As tumors evolve under these heterogeneous settings, a variety of genotypes emerge and lead to large differences in drug response phenotypes between patients. By grouping tumors based on their response to treatment, we can exploit principles of convergent evolution, where similar phenotypes evolve independently between individuals. In doing so, this work aims to aid precision medicine by identifying commonalities between tumors with similar drug response phenotypes.  Gene expression signatures are a powerful tool that can be used to predict convergent states of drug sensitiv- ity and resistance. Using vast open-source datasets, Aim 1 of this proposal will demonstrate a novel method for extracting and validating gene expression signatures to predict therapeutic response in cancer. Cell lines with the best and worst response to a given drug are pooled and compared using differential gene expression analysis. Genes with increased expression in a state of sensitivity or resistance become seed genes in a co-expression network based on gene expression from tumor samples. From there, only seed genes with strong co-expression within patient samples are extracted to form the ﬁnal gene expression signature. This novel approach integrates clinical sample data to the signature extraction method in order to increase translational value compared to molec- ular signatures extracted using only cell line datasets. Next, Aim 2 of this proposal investigates the phenomenon of collateral sensitivity, where resistance to one drug aligns with sensitivity to another drug. Because the evo- lution of collateral resistance and sensitivity can be unpredictable, molecular signatures of convergent states of collateral sensitivity and resistance could greatly enhance treatment planning once resistance to ﬁrst-line ther- apy has evolved. Using EGFR+ non-small cell lung cancer cell lines as a model system, this project aims to identify molecular signatures of evolutionarily convergent collateral sensitivity/resistance phenotypes during the experimental evolution of therapeutic resistance to targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tumor differences between patients can hinder the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer, as patients with seemingly similar tumors often display varying levels of chemo-sensitivity or -resistance. This work aims to abandon the “one-drug-ﬁts-all” approach and produce a novel method for discovering biomarkers of therapeutic sensitivity and resistance in cancer. Our results will assist clinicians in choosing the best available treatment for each individual patient.",Exploiting convergent evolution to design biomarker extraction tools for the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer,10138410,F30CA257076,"['Ally', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Imatinib', 'Individual', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Work', 'base', 'bcr-abl Fusion Proteins', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'gene product', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Long Acting Injectable Depots for TB Therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient dosing adherence is often compromised by the complex pill regimes and long duration of current TB drug therapies. These challenges are exacerbated in settings for patients in many social and global settings where TB co-therapy with HIV positive patients is stigmatized. Long-acting drug delivery products should therefore play an important role to increase patient adherence and increase drug efficacy. This project will develop a new injectable depot technology that address a general target product profile that includes multiple-month delivery from a single injection, low volume and low viscosity formulations to reduce patient pain, combination drug formulation where required, sustained drug release with designable PK profiles, minimal initial and run-out burst release to increase safety and prevent drug resistance, and for global settings has low cost of goods and lowered cold-chain requirements. This depot technology also has the important translational product attributes of streamlined CMC and cGMP manufacturing that could lead to more rapid clinical development achievement. A new injectable depot product for TB therapy will be developed that is differentiated from current dispersal based formulation approaches by being a fully synthetic depot. The proposal is structured around 2 specific aims in the R61 phase and two further aims in the R33 phase: (1) Prodrug monomers made by synthetic chemistry are directly polymerized in a second synthetic step to create “drugamer” depot therapeutics that have the drugs built into the depot itself. Compared to current dispersion formulation approaches, the drugamers exhibit higher drug loading efficiencies, the ability to co-formulate drugs of different lipophilicities, and linear, individually tailorable PK profiles that minimize first- and last-week burst release. These PK profiles are kinetically controlled by the linker properties that are tied to the individual drugs, along with polymer architectural design. This aim will exploit a unique high throughput polymer library and screening platform at CSIRO Melbourne to identify lead injectable depot designs using bedaquiline and moxifloxicin as initial drug examples. Sophisticated LC-MS/MS PK characterization will assess the sustained PK profile together with PK/PK modeling. (2) Evolve and optimize depot lead candidates through efficacy in an initial TB model that allows higher throughput imaging characterization of activity. This will be followed by an Mtb model assessment and selection to a lead depot candidate; (3) Test and optimize the two lead drug depot candidates in an A/BSL3 Mtb model, by the criteria of PK/PD, efficacy and dose dependence, and dosing duration. The lead depot will also be characterized in accelerated stability studies to test whether they can avoid cold-chain storage. (4) Evaluate iterated up-selected depots in combination depots from mixing optimized bedaquiline and moxifloxacin depots, including dual PK profiling and PK/PD modeling. This same approach could also be expanded to develop future therapeutic products based on other combination drug depot designs. These favorable platform attributes motivate this this project as a potential new addition to the repertoire of anti-TB patient products. Project Narrative This project will provide TB therapy products that make patient adherence to monotherapy and combination drug therapy more effective. The new technology will provide drug dosing from a single injectable product that can be tailored to 2-3 month dosing from single injections.

"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response.

While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't see the benefit from targeted therapy we normally expect.",Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response.,10092124,K99CA245896,"['ABL1 gene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Committee Members', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'German population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'care outcomes', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'conventional therapy', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large datasets', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model design', 'multiple omics', 'multitask', 'new combination therapies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'phosphoproteomics', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted agent', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'validation studies']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,137956
"Next generation drugs for bipolar depression and maintenance Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals is developing the next generation of drugs for the treatment of acute bipolar depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans. Existing drug classes are relatively ineffective and very few new modes-of-action have been developed in the past 40+ years. This is due, in part, to the biopharma industry’s focus on drugging single molecular targets, and the lack of predictive animal models for bipolar disorder. To overcome these significant hurdles, Blue Oak’s drug discovery paradigm combines custom-designed privileged chemotypes with a proven deep behavioral profiling method. Successful Phase I studies using this novel, but previously validated, approach resulted in the discovery and optimization of a novel lead compound for the treatment of BPD. The therapeutic utility of drug candidates was confirmed using molecular target profiling, ex vivo imaging of the forebrain circuits implicated in BPD and predictive translational medicine biomarkers. Phase II studies are focused on advancing the lead compound through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, the necessary next step for FDA review and approval of human studies. Aims include: (1) quantification of the preclinical therapeutic (safety) margin for the lead, or superior back-up molecule, including analyses of antidepressant activity; (2) confirmation of an enhanced EEG gamma band as a reliable translational biomarker of BPD drug activity and efficacy in non-human primates; (3) manufacture and qualification of cGLP drug product suitable for IND-enabling studies; and (4) completion of preclinical studies necessary for an IND filing with the FDA, including standard absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/TOX) preclinical studies and preclinical dose escalation studies necessary prior to first-in-human clinical studies. The successful completion of these aims will result in a Type B meeting to obtain guidance from the FDA and the filing of an IND package. The Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals team includes experienced “drug hunters” with expertise in systems neurobiology, medicinal chemistry and informatics, and advisors with proven track records in drug development and commercialization. The internal team is supported by trusted partners in preclinical research, development and validation of translational medicine biomarkers, clinical site management, and clinical development. If successful, this program will deliver a new drug candidate for bipolar depression that will improve the quality of life of patients and their families. This proposal aims to discover the next generation of drugs for the treatment of acute bipolar depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans and imposes a significant medical, social, and economic burden. Unfortunately, existing drug classes are relatively ineffective for most patients and very few new therapeutic mechanisms have been developed into medications in the past 40+ years.

"An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in life sciences and technology, the amount of money spent developing a single drug has stayed drastically expensive. Overall efficiencies have caused drug development to stay the same, with an average cost of $2.6 billion and 15 years to develop a single drug. Considering these challenges, there is an increased need for drug repositioning, in which new indications are found for existing or unapproved drugs. Here we introduce an approach that integrates only drug similarity metrics, such as side effect, structure, and target similarities, to identify novel indications for drugs. By focusing on drug similarity metrics, our proposed method allows for applications towards orphan molecules that presently have no primary indication. To improve upon the current methods of drug repurposing, we propose the developing of a computational approach that utilizes multiple data types within a machine-learning framework in order to predict indications a drug may treat. Based on the observations that similar drugs are used for similar indications, this method utilizes publicly available databases to identify associations between drugs, and integrates drug similarity data, as well as drug-target specific information, into a machine-learning framework in order to accurately predict indications for these drugs. Altogether, our method provides a novel, broadly applicable strategy that can identify novel indications, allowing for an accelerated and more efficient method for future drug development and repositioning efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bringing a drug to market requires an enormous amount of time and money, so our proposed research is designed to address this unmet need to streamline the drug discovery process.

"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways. Our proposal is designed to accelerate the pace of early drug discovery.","Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens",10090573,R01CA184984,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Time', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemical genetics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'proteostasis', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,1
"Novel computational approaches to predict drug response and combination effects Summary Tailoring the most desired therapy to each individual patient is the primary goal of precision medicine. A reliable and robust predictive model of drug effectiveness based on patients' unique genomic background is the key. For decades, communities have been trying to establish the relationship between molecular characteristics and drug response in complex diseases. Over the last decade, a large amount of genomic and epigenomic data together with pharmacogenomics data and response to perturbations data has been generated for many human cell lines through collaborations in the research community. These projects have led to significant therapeutic discoveries and have provided unprecedented opportunities to predict drug response using molecular fingerprints. However, even with great interest and effort in developing computational methods for predicting drug response, the prediction accuracies are at best only moderate. A related but distinct question is to understand the mechanisms of action (MOA) of drugs. Understanding drug MOAs enables characterization of drug side effects and identification of old drugs for new uses (i.e. drug repositioning). The traditional experimental assays to identify MOAs of drugs are expensive and time- consuming. There are three key questions to be addressed in the study. 1. Can novel computational approaches largely improve prediction accuracy of response to single drugs using comprehensive genomic and chemical information? 2. Can computational approaches provide a systematic way to mine genomics and drug response data to generate biological insights into the mechanisms of actions of various drugs? 3. Is it possible to develop an interpretable and accurate computation model to predict drug combination effects using pharmacogenomics data? Inherent features make it very challenging to predict drug response accurately: High-dimensionality of input data, the complex relationship between input features and response data; and heterogeneous drug/compound response patterns across different genetic lineages. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been making remarkable strides in various applications owing to the rapid progress of “deep learning. In Aim 1 of this study, we will develop novel AI-based approaches to address the computational challenges of improving the prediction accuracy of drug response. In Aim 2 of the study, we will develop a novel computation framework to study of MOA of drugs. In Aim 3, we will develop an interpretable deep-learning based computational framework to predict drug combination effects. In addition, we will develop a user-friendly web portal as an integrated research platform to share the methodology, algorithms and data generated from this proposed study to the research community.

"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10200091,R01GM132595,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Ions', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Binding', 'Ontology', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'density', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'online resource', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,561173
"In silico safety pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY: A major factor plaguing drug development is that there is no drug-screening tool that can distinguish between drugs that will induce cardiac arrhythmias from chemically similar safe drugs. The current approaches rely on substitute markers such as action potential duration or QT interval prolongation on the ECG. There is an urgent need to identify a new approach that can predict actual proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry rather than relying on surrogate indicators. We have brought together an expert team to innovate at the interfaces of experimental and computational modeling disciplines and develop an in silico simulation pipeline to predict cardiotoxicity over multiple temporal and spatial scales from the atom to the cardiac rhythm. An essential and unique aspect of our approach is that we propose to utilize atomistic scale simulation to predict the transition rates of ion channels and adrenergic receptors and how they are modified by drug interaction. We hypothesize that it is the subtleties of these interactions that are likely to be the critical determinants of drug associated safety or proarrhythmia. In the last award period, we successfully developed an unprecedented linkage: We connected the highly disparate space and time scales of ion channel structure and function. We utilized atomistic simulation to compute drug kinetic rates were directly used as parameters in a hERG function model. The model components were then integrated into predictive models at the cell and tissue scales to expose fundamental arrhythmia vulnerability mechanisms and complex interactions underlying emergent behaviors. Human clinical data were used for model validation and showed excellent agreement, demonstrating feasibility of this new approach for cardiotoxicity prediction. In this renewal application we propose to hugely extend this approach to include prediction of the interaction of cardiac channel gating and drug interaction as well as the inclusion of adrenergic receptor interactions with drugs. Another essential aspect of safety pharmacology is the development of new approaches to allow more efficient drug design, screening and prediction of cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we will seek to develop, extend and apply a variety of machine learning and deep learning approaches to improve drug discovery by predicting proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry with an efficient process that identify drug congeners via machine learning to maximize therapy and minimize side effects. Finally, we propose to classify drugs into categories based on proarrhythmia risk in normal and diseased virtual tissue settings. The multiscale model for prediction of cardiopharmacology that we will develop in this application will be applied to projects demonstrating its usefulness for efficacy or toxicity of drug treatments in the complex physiological system of the heart. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Cardiotoxicity in the form of deadly abnormal rhythms is one of the most common and dangerous risks for drugs in development. There is an urgent need for new approaches to accurately screen and predict the effects of drugs on cardiac rhythms.

"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to continue development of a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target.

"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,10087862,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,1140875
"New Methods and Tools for Computational Drug Discovery Project Summary  My goal is to develop effective and efﬁcient computational methods for drug discovery, apply these methods to ﬁnd new and efﬁcacious drugs to treat diseases, and deploy these methods in easy-to-use open source tools. My research group pioneered the development and integration of deep neural networks in user-friendly molecular docking software for structure-based drug design to predict poses and potency of small molecules binding to their molecular targets. We will build on our foundational work by using deep learning to simultaneously solving the scoring and sampling problems, which will overcome scalability limitations inherent in current approaches.  We propose to develop the ﬁrst deep generative models for structure-based drug design. Unlike tra- ditional screening, generative modeling is not limited to a predeﬁned chemical space. In generative mod- eling, a deep neural network learns an underlying distribution of molecular structures and properties represented as a latent space. New structures can be extracted from this learned latent space to have desirable properties. Ideally, a generative model will produce novel, near-optimal molecular structures almost instantaneously. We hypothesize that training generative models using existing 3D protein and ligand structures will allow us to create general models that can be productively applied to new, struc- turally enabled targets due to the richness and universality of protein-ligand interactions. We will further develop these methods to support the generation of optimized lead candidates, where the generative process is updated to include results from experimental assays as the drug discovery process progresses.  We will continually apply our methods to identify small molecule modulators of molecular interac- tions relevant to normal physiology and disease. For example, using our current tools, we identiﬁed the ﬁrst inhibitors of the proﬁlin-actin interaction, an anti-angiogenesis target with relevance to cancer and diabetic retinopathy, and we plan to further improve these compounds with the goal of identifying candi- dates for clinical testing. We will apply our methods to address other under-explored molecular targets, such as NFATc2, which is implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases. These prospective applications of our methods will provide unbiased and realistic evaluations that further inform their development.  Finally, all of our code and trained deep neural network models will be deployed either as new tools for generative modeling or as enhancements to our widely used open source tools for computational drug discovery: (1) PHARMIT, an interactive web application for structure-based drug discovery; (2) GNINA, a C/C++ deep learning framework for molecular docking; and (3) the newly released LIBMOLGRID, a Python library for accelerated molecular gridding that integrates with popular deep learning toolkits. These tools and methods will make the drug discovery process more accessible and efﬁcient. Project Narrative  The research supported by this award will develop new computational methods and tools for drug discovery so that novel therapeutics can be discovered more quickly and with less expense. The de- veloped methods will be evaluated prospectively in drug discovery projects of high relevance to human health.

"National Drug Early Warning System Coordinating Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our team enthusiastically submits this proposal to be the next NDEWS Coordinating Center (CC) in response to RFA DA-20-016. The CC is spearheaded by the Cottler Lab (Epidemiology), with investigators from University of Florida's Center for Addiction Research & Education (Nixon, Goldberger, Striley), the Palamar Lab at New York University and the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Lab-Barenholtz) at Florida Atlantic University. Our CC will maintain strong sentinel surveillance efforts while expanding our Early Warning Network sites, adding leading edge indicators that extend beyond lagged city-level data. We will extend the work of NIDA-funded researchers, while harmonizing and analyzing data, with timely and systematic notifications. The new NDEWS CC will work to seamlessly transition on-going efforts, advance methods and approaches, establish and engage a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), and collaborate with all consortium components to accomplish these Specific Aims: 1) Provide an Early Warning Network of 12 NDEWS sites and 6 Community Epidemiology Workgroup sites for ongoing surveillance of urban, rural, and suburban areas; 2) Utilize established and new key community-level indicators for ongoing surveillance to assess trends in availability, use, and consequences of NPS and known substances, standardized across all sites to facilitate cross-site analyses; 3) Incorporate and leverage novel surveillance methods to ensure early detection of signals of NPS and emerging drug trends, including data from DanceSafe “drug checkers,” Rapid Street Reporting (RSR) with hair testing for NPS exposure, the implementation of a virtual HealthStreet substance user network, and development of an innovative machine learning approach to detect emergence of NPS in real-time through drug retailers (including the “darknet”) and social media platforms; 4) Harmonize standardized indicator definitions for all incoming surveillance data with the input of NIDA, the SAG, and Early Warning Network experts; facilitate cross-site comparability of data; manage quality control; organize, coordinate, and summarize data, and provide organizational and logistical support; 5) Disseminate findings quickly via dashboards modeled after Florida Drug-related Outcomes Surveillance and Tracking System (FROST); push notifications for regular updates and alerts; webinars; virtual Our Community Our Health Town Hall meetings; and traditionally through official reports, peer-reviewed publications, media, and annual reporting at CPDD, and elsewhere; 6) Conduct on-the-ground epidemiologic investigations on topics of immediate crisis or need; 7) Provide operational, administrative, and logistical support to the enterprise and NIDA; and 8) Train the next generation of scientists in NDEWS methodology.  NDEWS has unrealized potential, and with this funding, we will transform the culture so that NDEWS is NIDA's and the field's go-to source for drug trends in the US. It will provide evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies to eventually reduce the harmful effects of substance use around the world. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is nothing more aligned with the NIDA Strategic Plan to protect the public health than detecting signals of emerging drug use trends. This proposal coordinates the data collection efforts from 18 sites and NIDA funded investigators to notify people everywhere of the signals detected. With this information, immediate responses can take place for interventions.

"Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging our therapeutic strategies. Drug resistance occurs as a result of this evolution when drug pressure changes the balance of molecular recognition events, selectively weakening inhibitor binding while maintaining the biological function of the therapeutic target. Disrupting the therapeutic target’s activity is necessary but not sufficient to avoid resistance. We hypothesize that the multi-dimensional landscape of resistance evolution can be elucidated through integration of experimental and computational data to reveal the key pathways and coupled molecular mechanisms to resistance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this strategy can be incorporated into structure-based drug design to evaluate novel inhibitors.  Resistance occurs under gradual and persistent drug pressure, and interestingly the mutations are not limited to the active site of a drug target, but can occur throughout the enzyme to confer high levels of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which this resistance occurs is not clear. Our aim is to exploit the rich and versatile experimental data, integrating inhibitor potency and crystallographic structures with ensemble dynamics in an internally consistent manner using machine learning to elucidate both the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and generate predictive models of inhibitor potency.

"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,10136717,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'rosiglitazone', 'safety outcomes', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,328000
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,10059161,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transposon sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2021,913527
"Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance Project Summary Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. Despite the increase in research in the past years exploring social media data for pharmacovigilance, and the evidence that it indeed can bring forward the patient perspective, there is no systematic approach to collect and annotate such data for research purposes. This renewal builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP) methods for social media mining in pharmacovigilance to make the collection of social media data about medication use precise and systematic enough to be useful to researchers and the public, alongside established sources such as the FDA's data and other public collections of drug adverse event data. It presents innovative methods to automatically collect and analyze longitudinal health data, piloting methods for interventions through the same media that can inform the public and help validate the automatic methods. As validation, we include a comparison to an existing reference standard for adverse effects that integrates FDA's data and HER data, as well as specific case studies focused on (Aim 3.1) the use of NSAIDs and anti-depressants in pregnancy and (Aim 3.2) factors for non-adherence.

This renewal application builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP), developing novel methods for data extraction that makes it possible to integrate information from social media with existing drug safety information and extract health data over time.",Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance,10409053,R01LM011176,"['Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Animals', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Case Study', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consent', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Live Birth', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'MEDLINE', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'cohort', 'dosage', 'drug efficacy', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'health data', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'language processing', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'pharmacovigilance', 'side effect', 'social media', 'systematic review', 'treatment duration']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,338435
"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health. NARRATIVE This proposal describes a platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical forces in cells, which play major roles in human health. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. As an application of this platform, we propose to measure the forces stem- cell derived cardiomyocytes which bear genetically encoded contractile dysfunction for drug screening.",Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets,10158533,R21GM137151,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Boron', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrical Resistance', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Individual', 'Island', 'Kinetics', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Myopathy', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Relaxation', 'Role', 'Sarcomeres', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'analog', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cellular engineering', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'detection limit', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'metallicity', 'nano', 'nanofabrication', 'response', 'sensor', 'stem cells', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,182532
"Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery. While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+ can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins. Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage, calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cell- by-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes, but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response, 30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research. FDA guidelines stipulate that all new drugs be tested for dangerous side-effects on the heart as part of preclinical research; however, the current tests are poorly predictive of both dangerous and safe drugs leading to unwarranted attrition and dangerous drugs reaching clinic. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor tissue (iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) are widely considered to hold great promise for clinical trial in a dish studies of drug cardiotoxicity. This STTR proposal is to commercialize a high throughput platform to accurately identify drug candidates that have cardiac side effects, in particular adding the ability to detect the type of primary heart cell damage common with anti-cancer drugs in a fully automated (high throughput) robotic assay for the first time, to improve the efficiency of preclinical research and the safety of human clinical trials, which will also likely have the added benefit of reducing animal research.","Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes",10268102,R42HL158510,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Aging', 'American', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Contract Services', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Industry', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Motion', 'Myocardium', 'Myopathy', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Contracts', 'Risk Assessment', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer survival', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cell injury', 'cellular imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'compound 30', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'heart cell', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lead series', 'male', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'side effect', 'therapeutic candidate', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"VALA SCIENCES, INC.",R42,2021,299871
