"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9583421,K99DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2019,92213,0.2451514119558836
"Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk ABSTRACT Whereas the majority of smokers will quit in any given year, the majority of quit attempts result in relapse. One reason interventions may fail is that they teach smokers strategies for coping with craving in response to environmental triggers, but do not provide smokers with just-in-time information about their risk of smoking lapse. Such risk information could be used to alert smokers to engage in relevant coping strategies including avoidance or use of quick acting pharmacotherapies (e.g. nicotine inhaler). The overarching premise of the proposed research is that prediction of lapse risk can be enhanced by using computer vision to analyze images of everyday life. Recent findings by our team suggest that environments associated with lapse risk can be detected in real-time by coupling deep learning-based object detection with an appropriate classification model. In preliminary research, images taken by smokers of smoking and nonsmoking environments (80 subjects, 2870 images) were used to train such a model, resulting in 77.5% accuracy (0.826 AUC) distinguishing these environments on a separate test set (16 subjects, 516 images). Encouraged by this preliminary finding, we propose to refine and scale up this system by a) creating a larger and more representative image database that includes a sample of everyday environments acquired from smokers (n=60) and b) testing novel, personalized approaches for increasing smoking environment classification accuracy and assessing smoking risk across three aims. In Aim 1, we will improve smoking environment classification accuracy and prediction of smoking risk by re-training an existing deep learning model to recognize a broad set of smoking-related objects (e.g. packs of cigarettes/ashtrays). In Aim 2, we will further improve performance by fitting personalized models that account for individual differences in preferred or typical smoking environments. In Exploratory Aim 3, we will predict craving and negative affect/stress using a similar approach. The proposed research represents an innovative and critical next step in the development of a system that identifies smoking risk and/or its antecedents in real-time to support a just-in-time adaptive intervention for smoking cessation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of smokers relapse within one month of quitting smoking. Environments (e.g. park) and their related objects (e.g. park bench) are associated with smoking and urges to smoke and can serve as triggers to lapse and relapse. The proposed research will use state-of-the-art computer vision and object detection to identify smoking risk environments and objects with the goal of eventually developing systems that alert smokers to such risks from everyday images acquired with cameras worn by smokers. Such a system can be incorporated into more comprehensive and effective smoking cessation programs.",Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk,9774018,R21DA047131,"['Adult', 'Behavior', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nicotine Inhaler', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Shelter facility', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'coping', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'negative affect', 'non-smoking', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'time use']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,201250,0.32311637289078865
"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. This knowledge can be utilized to reduce the public health burden of tobacco use.",Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment,9627951,R01CA224537,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Behavioral', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'knowledge base', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'primary outcome', 'risk prediction model', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,600514,0.22617709525668972
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9768419,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,606526,0.10961149243999506
"Smartband/smartphone-based automatic smoking detection and real time mindfulness intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Effective smoking cessation interventions are available but underutilized. Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promising tool for helping smokers quit. Delivery of treatments via smartphone apps may maximize the likelihood of use by smokers and the potential impact on smoking behavior. However, currently available smartphone apps for smoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, no available apps utilize wearable technologies; all current apps require users to self-report their smoking; and no apps deliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. Therefore, this pilot trial will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. The interventions to be delivered will be brief mindfulness exercises that have been previously shown to reduce craving and smoking. This trial uses SmokeBeat, a novel mobile technology platform that uses multimodal data from wristband sensors to monitor and detect smoking, notify smokers about their smoking in real time and deliver real time interventions triggered by detected smoking episodes. SmokeBeat also applies machine learning to smoking tracking data to identify individual smoking patterns and deliver real time interventions targeted at predicted smoking episodes. This trial tests a three-step intervention to reduce smoking, in which smokers first become aware of their smoking and triggers by tracking smoking; then gain a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking by “mindful smoking”; and finally learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke. Briefly, daily smokers (N=200, ≥5 cig/day) will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a “mindful smoking” exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (“RAIN”: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit. Aim 1 will be to determine treatment fidelity. Fidelity measures will be: (1) percent of smoking episodes correctly detected; (2) percent of “mindful smoking” exercises correctly triggered by smoking; and (3) users’ real time ratings of how timely “RAIN” was delivered to predicted smoking episodes. Aim 2 will be to determine adherence to treatment. Adherence measures will be: (1) percent of time spent wearing the smartband; (2) percent of smoking notifications answered; (3) percent of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings (e.g., timeliness and others) answered; and (4) percent of mindfulness exercises completed. Aim 3 will be to determine the acceptability of treatment. Acceptability measures will be: (1) average helpfulness ratings after each mindfulness exercise; (2) feedback on user experience surveys. Overall: this project tests a highly innovative technology-based mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent developments in mobile technology suggest new and innovative ways to deliver effective smoking cessation treatments. This project will test the feasibility of using a smartband to automatically monitor and detect smoking and deliver real time mindfulness interventions via smartphone app to reduce smoking.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs.

"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation.

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts.

"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,9782867,R01CA234539,"['12 year old', '17 year old', '18 year old', '20 year old', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diffusion', 'Education', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Escalator', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Smoke-free home', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Status', 'Structural Models', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'aged', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparison group', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nicotine use', 'nicotine user', 'peer', 'prognostic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco user', 'young adult']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,432923,0.16146868870370804
"Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk ABSTRACT Whereas the majority of smokers will quit in any given year, the majority of quit attempts result in relapse. One reason interventions may fail is that they teach smokers strategies for coping with craving in response to environmental triggers, but do not provide smokers with just-in-time information about their risk of smoking lapse. Such risk information could be used to alert smokers to engage in relevant coping strategies including avoidance or use of quick acting pharmacotherapies (e.g. nicotine inhaler). The overarching premise of the proposed research is that prediction of lapse risk can be enhanced by using computer vision to analyze images of everyday life. Recent findings by our team suggest that environments associated with lapse risk can be detected in real-time by coupling deep learning-based object detection with an appropriate classification model. In preliminary research, images taken by smokers of smoking and nonsmoking environments (80 subjects, 2870 images) were used to train such a model, resulting in 77.5% accuracy (0.826 AUC) distinguishing these environments on a separate test set (16 subjects, 516 images). Encouraged by this preliminary finding, we propose to refine and scale up this system by a) creating a larger and more representative image database that includes a sample of everyday environments acquired from smokers (n=60) and b) testing novel, personalized approaches for increasing smoking environment classification accuracy and assessing smoking risk across three aims. In Aim 1, we will improve smoking environment classification accuracy and prediction of smoking risk by re-training an existing deep learning model to recognize a broad set of smoking-related objects (e.g. packs of cigarettes/ashtrays). In Aim 2, we will further improve performance by fitting personalized models that account for individual differences in preferred or typical smoking environments. In Exploratory Aim 3, we will predict craving and negative affect/stress using a similar approach. The proposed research represents an innovative and critical next step in the development of a system that identifies smoking risk and/or its antecedents in real-time to support a just-in-time adaptive intervention for smoking cessation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of smokers relapse within one month of quitting smoking. Environments (e.g. park) and their related objects (e.g. park bench) are associated with smoking and urges to smoke and can serve as triggers to lapse and relapse. The proposed research will use state-of-the-art computer vision and object detection to identify smoking risk environments and objects with the goal of eventually developing systems that alert smokers to such risks from everyday images acquired with cameras worn by smokers. Such a system can be incorporated into more comprehensive and effective smoking cessation programs.",Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk,9617141,R21DA047131,"['Adult', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nicotine Inhaler', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Shelter facility', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'coping', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'negative affect', 'non-smoking', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'time use']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,200208,0.32311637289078865
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9576355,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,672594,0.10961149243999506
"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs.

"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days.

"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,9647728,R01CA234539,"['12 year old', '17 year old', '18 year old', '20 year old', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diffusion', 'Education', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Escalator', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Smoke-free home', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Status', 'Structural Models', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'aged', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparison group', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'nicotine use', 'nicotine user', 'peer', 'prognostic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco user', 'young adult']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,446068,0.16146868870370804
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9547313,R01CA190329,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Breathing', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Cigarette', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Geography', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'arm movement', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'data to knowledge', 'experience', 'field study', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'population health', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'uptake', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,1,0.27601595303152526
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs.

"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult.

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities among African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities.

"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will clarify why the majority of smokers relapse quickly following a quit attempt.        ",Neural basis of smoking relapse,9079131,R01DA041402,"['Abstinence', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Counseling', 'Cues', 'Economic Burden', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Insula of Reil', 'Investigation', 'Left', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Status', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral response', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'nicotine patch', 'nicotine replacement', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relapse risk', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'stress reactivity', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,523814,0.3265895695670612
"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery. Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery.

"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving - Supplement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult.

"Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is a leading preventable cause of death, responsible for one in five deaths annually in the United States alone. Many adult smokers want to or try to quit smoking, but, are unable to do so due to lack of personalized cessation treatments that ultimately leads to successful quitting. The primary hurdle has been the unavailability of technology that can be used to collect continuous measurements of stress contexts in field on predictors of abstinence and relapse. Without these measurements, it is difficult to understand the psychophysiological and biobehavioral stress mechanisms that may predict smoke lapse. This application proposes to use a new field deployable tool called AutoSense that was developed under NIH's GEI program to collect personal psychophysiological measures of stress and mediating social and environmental contexts in the natural environment of individuals to discover signatures of early relapse. AutoSense consists of several wireless sensors (e.g., ECG, respiration, triaxial accelerometer) attached to a chest band that transmit sensor measurements wirelessly to a smart phone. Fine-grained measurement of physiology enables computation of physiological measures that are predictive of stress such as minute ventilation and heart rate variability. The project uses sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate stress levels, smoking episodes and conversation episodes from physiological measurements. In addition, accelerometers are used to identify changes in posture and physical activity, and GPS measurements on the mobile phone are used to identify location and transportation modality. Seventy-two smokers who want to quit will be recruited. Two weeks prior to quit date, they will wear AutoSense for 24h in the field. Behavioral treatment for abstinence will begin in their visit to the lab prior to quitting. They wil wear AutoSense for 72h in the field, beginning on the quit date. In addition to collecting continuous measurements across all sensors, smoking and lapse events will be self-reported. Saliva samples will be collected for cortisol assessment, in addition to physiological measures of stress. Participants will report back to the lab one week after the quit date to determine smoking/lapse status. The aim of this project is to identify psychophysiological measures of stress and environmental cues that may predict early lapse. First, it will discover patterns in physiological and hormonal measures in response to withdrawal stress and acute stress that may predict lapse in the first week. Second, it will investigate the role of social and environmental context such as conversation behavior (e.g., duration and frequency of conversations), lifestyle factors (e.g., time spent in seated posture and in commuting), location (time spent at home vs. office), and indoor/outdoor status in mediating the relationship between stress and early lapse.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.         Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids.

The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects.

The majority of smokers express a desire to quit, and each year more than half will. However, less than 7% of those who quit will achieve long-term abstinence. Much is known about the immediate and predictive antecedents of the first cigarette following a quit attempt (i.e. lapse), which include situations (e.g. presence of other smokers) and activities (e.g. alcohol consumption). While ideally this information could be used to develop a system that detects these predictive antecedents in real-time and provides just-in-time intervention; to date no such systems have been developed. The overarching goal of our research program is to develop and test such a system that uses smartphone technology. The system developed here can be incorporated into diverse application platforms that target the modification of smoking and multiple other health related behaviors including drug and alcohol use, food consumption and physical activity. Despite the fact that smoking is a known cause of death and disability, many smokers find it very difficult to quit and those who do quit often return to smoking (i.e. lapse). Although the situational factors leading up to a lapse are well documented, treatments designed to interrupt these situations before relapse occurs have not been forthcoming. Here, we propose to develop a smartphone-based system that can detect these situations in real-time. Once developed, the sensor system can be incorporated into mobile smoking cessation applications designed to help smokers avoid relapse.",Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior,8494033,R21DA034471,"['Abstinence', 'Acoustics', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Paper', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Salivary', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Motion', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'drinking', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'food consumption', 'innovation', 'premature', 'programs', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'sound', 'technology development', 'technology/technique', 'therapy design', 'virtual', 'visual imagery']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,188400,0.271044426949715
"Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is a leading preventable cause of death, responsible for one in five deaths annually in the United States alone. Many adult smokers want to or try to quit smoking, but, are unable to do so due to lack of personalized cessation treatments that ultimately leads to successful quitting. The primary hurdle has been the unavailability of technology that can be used to collect continuous measurements of stress contexts in field on predictors of abstinence and relapse. Without these measurements, it is difficult to understand the psychophysiological and biobehavioral stress mechanisms that may predict smoke lapse. This application proposes to use a new field deployable tool called AutoSense that was developed under NIH's GEI program to collect personal psychophysiological measures of stress and mediating social and environmental contexts in the natural environment of individuals to discover signatures of early relapse. AutoSense consists of several wireless sensors (e.g., ECG, respiration, triaxial accelerometer) attached to a chest band that transmit sensor measurements wirelessly to a smart phone. Fine-grained measurement of physiology enables computation of physiological measures that are predictive of stress such as minute ventilation and heart rate variability. The project uses sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate stress levels, smoking episodes and conversation episodes from physiological measurements. In addition, accelerometers are used to identify changes in posture and physical activity, and GPS measurements on the mobile phone are used to identify location and transportation modality. Seventy-two smokers who want to quit will be recruited. Two weeks prior to quit date, they will wear AutoSense for 24h in the field. Behavioral treatment for abstinence will begin in their visit to the lab prior to quitting. They wil wear AutoSense for 72h in the field, beginning on the quit date. In addition to collecting continuous measurements across all sensors, smoking and lapse events will be self-reported. Saliva samples will be collected for cortisol assessment, in addition to physiological measures of stress. Participants will report back to the lab one week after the quit date to determine smoking/lapse status. The aim of this project is to identify psychophysiological measures of stress and environmental cues that may predict early lapse. First, it will discover patterns in physiological and hormonal measures in response to withdrawal stress and acute stress that may predict lapse in the first week. Second, it will investigate the role of social and environmental context such as conversation behavior (e.g., duration and frequency of conversations), lifestyle factors (e.g., time spent in seated posture and in commuting), location (time spent at home vs. office), and indoor/outdoor status in mediating the relationship between stress and early lapse.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse. Given the adverse impact of smoking on smokers and non-smokers, such advancement will significantly improve the quality of life and reduce public health burden.              By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse.

"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.        Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters. The proposed project will modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids.

The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.                   Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids.

"The Development of a Noninvasive Monitoring System for Cigarette Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. Available methods of smoking assessment (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures of smoking behavior that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. Methodologically, PACT will consist of two major components: 1. Wearable sensors. Miniature sensors integrated into the clothing will monitors the breathing and activity patterns of individuals. The signals from the sensors will be processed and recognized to identify and objectively characterize each individual puff. 2. Software for signal processing and pattern recognition. Automatic computer software will analyze sensor signals and detect patterns uniquely identifying smoking events. Objective metrics such as number of puffs and inter-puff interval will be extracted. The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation.

The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the wearable sensor PACT system and pattern recognition method in people smoking in the natural environment. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of smoking behavior.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. The goal of this research is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscious effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. The PACT device will provide an accurate and precise measure of real-world smoking. The device can provide the user and health professional feedback on the frequency of smoking and inhalation patterns (such as depth of inhalation and smoke holding) throughout the day in their home and community. This information can be used to inform behavioral strategies in smoking cessation programs. The data collected by PACT can also provide an objective method of assessing the effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacological smoking interventions.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

"Elective Surgery as a Teachable Moment for Smoking Cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The term ""teachable moment"" refers to an event that motivates individuals to spontaneously adopt risk- reducing health behaviors. Events such as the diagnosis of smoking-related illnesses (e.g. cancer) and the scheduling of surgery spontaneously (i.e., in the absence of interventions) increase the rate of quitting. However, as recently discussed in an important conceptual paper by McBride et al, little is known about factors that make certain cueing events ""teachable"". They proposed a heuristic in which an event is a ""teachable moment"" for smoking cessation to the extent that it impacts 3 key constructs. Although appealing in concept, its validity has not been evaluated. The scheduling of surgery provides a unique opportunity to test the McBride model. This study will evaluate the McBride heuristic as applied to smoking behavior following elective surgical procedures. Two specific aims will be pursued. In the first we will develop measures of the Me Bride model specific to the surgical setting, and perform an initial evaluation of their stability and internal consistency in a group of surgical patients. In the second, we will perform a pilot study to explore the hypothesis that in patients scheduled for elective surgery: 1) higher perceptions of risks or greater negative expectancies regarding health outcomes related to smoking, 2) higher levels of positive or negative affective responses, and 3) self-concept or role expectations related to smoking will correlate with measures of self-efficacy and intent, and predict postoperative abstinence from smoking. Measures of the McBride constructs will be administered to smokers scheduled for elective surgery, whose smoking behavior will be evaluated for up to 30 days postoperatively. Structural equation modeling will be utilized both to validate the measurement model established in Aim 1 and to test the fit of the structural model associated with the McBride heuristic to postoperative smoking behavior. Relevance to public health: Evaluation of the McBride heuristic is of interest not only from a theoretical standpoint, but may have practical implications regarding the design of behavioral interventions to exploit the ""teachable moment. For example, if the constructs predict behavior, interventions can attempt to specifically influence these constructs. Our overall goal is to develop effective tobacco use interventions for surgical patients; this project will be an important step in this process.           n/a",Elective Surgery as a Teachable Moment for Smoking Cessation,7226537,R03CA126371,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior', 'clinical research', 'health', 'model', 'smoking', 'smoking cessation', 'surgery']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC,R03,2006,74000,0.24930986102252126

"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9883770,K99DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2020,87670,0.2451514119558836
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation.

"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. This knowledge can be utilized to reduce the public health burden of tobacco use.",Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment,9839496,R01CA224537,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Behavioral', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'knowledge base', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'primary outcome', 'risk prediction model', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,617352,0.22617709525668972
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9990732,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,623237,0.10961149243999506
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9851750,R01MD010362,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'behavior change', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'contextual factors', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'disability', 'distress tolerance', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social cohesion', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,849960,0.37361704233862575
"Smartband/smartphone-based automatic smoking detection and real time mindfulness intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Effective smoking cessation interventions are available but underutilized. Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promising tool for helping smokers quit. Delivery of treatments via smartphone apps may maximize the likelihood of use by smokers and the potential impact on smoking behavior. However, currently available smartphone apps for smoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, no available apps utilize wearable technologies; all current apps require users to self-report their smoking; and no apps deliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. Therefore, this pilot trial will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. The interventions to be delivered will be brief mindfulness exercises that have been previously shown to reduce craving and smoking. This trial uses SmokeBeat, a novel mobile technology platform that uses multimodal data from wristband sensors to monitor and detect smoking, notify smokers about their smoking in real time and deliver real time interventions triggered by detected smoking episodes. SmokeBeat also applies machine learning to smoking tracking data to identify individual smoking patterns and deliver real time interventions targeted at predicted smoking episodes. This trial tests a three-step intervention to reduce smoking, in which smokers first become aware of their smoking and triggers by tracking smoking; then gain a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking by “mindful smoking”; and finally learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke. Briefly, daily smokers (N=200, ≥5 cig/day) will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a “mindful smoking” exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (“RAIN”: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit. Aim 1 will be to determine treatment fidelity. Fidelity measures will be: (1) percent of smoking episodes correctly detected; (2) percent of “mindful smoking” exercises correctly triggered by smoking; and (3) users’ real time ratings of how timely “RAIN” was delivered to predicted smoking episodes. Aim 2 will be to determine adherence to treatment. Adherence measures will be: (1) percent of time spent wearing the smartband; (2) percent of smoking notifications answered; (3) percent of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings (e.g., timeliness and others) answered; and (4) percent of mindfulness exercises completed. Aim 3 will be to determine the acceptability of treatment. Acceptability measures will be: (1) average helpfulness ratings after each mindfulness exercise; (2) feedback on user experience surveys. Overall: this project tests a highly innovative technology-based mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent developments in mobile technology suggest new and innovative ways to deliver effective smoking cessation treatments. This project will test the feasibility of using a smartband to automatically monitor and detect smoking and deliver real time mindfulness interventions via smartphone app to reduce smoking.

"A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Tobacco smoking among women in Romania increased dramatically, by close to 30%, between 2011-2018 and the share of smokers with quit attempts decreased by 37%. Tobacco kills more than 8 million people a year around the world. The burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Romania, where 80% of the worldwide 1.1 billion smokers live. Our work showed that 30% of women smoke pre-pregnancy in Romania and half of the smokers continue during pregnancy. It is critically important to address tobacco smoking during pregnancy, an extraordinary window of opportunity for sustained cessation. The objectives of this application are to develop, implement, and test the feasibility and effectiveness of an adaptive mobile pregnancy tobacco cessation app-based intervention using deep tailoring and a self-nominated support person, and to build mHealth research capacity in Romania. We build on our pregnancy smoking cessation trials with spousal support in Romania, including the ongoing Smoke Free Together (SFT1.0) mHealth pilot trial and the Quit Together telephone counseling trial that shows preliminary evidence of efficacy, and on our partnerships in Romania. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will show evidence of feasibility and effectiveness in increasing positive support, pregnancy cessation, and postnatal abstinence. The app will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, use of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep tailoring to continuously adapt the intervention, the emphasis on increasing positive support, and the use of the app by both smoker and quit-partner. The aims are: 1. (R21 phase). Develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the SFT2.0 app-based mobile smoking cessation intervention with quit-partner support during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania; 2. (R33 phase). Test the SFT2.0 app-based smoking cessation intervention in a hybrid effectiveness and implementation randomized controlled trial; 3. (R21 and R33 phases). Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the effectiveness and implementation of a smartphone-based app for pregnancy smoking cessation with quit- partner support. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal smoking as the intervention has a high potential to be adopted in the universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other populations. The development of the international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is expected to positively impact mHealth research in CEE and the neighboring region. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the findings will have a system wide sustainable impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking in Romania and in Central and Eastern Europe, with applications to the US and other populations. The research is also expected to have an important impact on the methodology and design of mobile technology clinical and public health interventions during the reproductive years with lifelong potential implications. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help enhance health and reduce the burdens of human illness.",A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support,10057086,R21HD103039,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Eastern Europe', 'Effectiveness', 'Friends', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Romania', 'Self Determination', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Spouses', 'Stress', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'craving', 'design', 'iterative design', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peer support', 'pilot trial', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal cigarette smoking', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'reproductive', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,1000,0.21963868812458245
"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control 7. Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down- regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand, events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms (e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high- level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2). 8. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking is among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States because smoking increases risk for lung cancer and various diseases. Though U.S. smoking rates have declined, a substantial percentage of adults, particularly those living in poverty who have repeatedly tried and failed to quit, still smoke and therefore could benefit from novel interventions for cessation that operate through different mechanisms than those of traditional treatments. This study will use neuroimaging to uncover the mechanisms of action of a promising strategy for affect regulation and smoking cessation and also build profiles of individuals for whom this strategy does and does not work, thereby providing tangible and practical information that public health professionals and clinicians can use to inform personalized treatments for cigarette smoking cessation.",Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control,9909179,R01CA240452,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medial', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cost', 'craving', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'insight', 'lens', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'preventable death', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,610247,0.16848323999205153
"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,10011784,R01CA234539,"['12 year old', '17 year old', '18 year old', '20 year old', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diffusion', 'Education', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Escalator', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Smoke-free home', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Status', 'Structural Models', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'aged', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparison group', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nicotine use', 'nicotine user', 'peer', 'prognostic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco user', 'young adult']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,312701,0.16146868870370804
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9985596,R01CA190329,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Breathing', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Cigarette', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Geography', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'arm movement', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'data to knowledge', 'experience', 'field study', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'population health', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'uptake', 'wearable sensor technology', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,582564,0.27601595303152526
