"Towards Generating a Multimodal and Multivariate Classification Model from Imaging and Non-Imaging Measures for Accurate Diagnosis and Monitoring of Dementia in Parkinsons disease. PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures (diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non- imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition, and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and 2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores. Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because identification of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients at a high-risk for developing dementia (PDD) is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and to better understand the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project identifies the best predictive biomarkers for PDD through examining the comprehensive Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion-MRI (dMRI)-derived white matter (WM) changes predicting PDD, examining the network-level discrepancies predicting PDD derived from dMRI-derived whole-brain structural connectivity and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI)-derived whole-brain functional connectivity, and developing a multivariate and multimodal statistical model by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures such as clinical (disease duration and severity), demographics (age, sex, years of education), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF- measures (β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein, tau) to identify the best predictive biomarkers of PDD through machine learning approach.

"Web-based Automated Imaging Differentiation of Parkinsonism SUMMARY Across the globe, there has been a considerable growth in the number of people diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Estimates indicate that from 1990 to 2015 the number of Parkinsonism diagnoses doubled, with more than 6 million people currently carrying the diagnosis, and by year 2040, 12 and 14.2 million people will be diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian variant (MSAp), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are neurodegenerative forms of Parkinsonism, which can be difficult to diagnose as they share similar motor and non-motor features, and they each have an increased chance of developing dementia. In the first five years of a PD diagnosis, about 58% of PD are misdiagnosed, and of these misdiagnoses about half have either MSA or PSP. Since PD, MSAp, and PSP require unique treatment plans and different medications, and clinical trials testing new medications require the correct diagnosis, there is an urgent need for both clinic ready and clinical-trial ready markers for differential diagnosis of PD, MSAp, and PSP. Over the past decade, we have developed diffusion imaging as an innovative biomarker for differentiating PD, MSAp, and PSP. In this proposal, we will leverage our extensive experience to create a web-based software tool that can process diffusion imaging data from anywhere in the world. We will disseminate and test the tool in the largest prospective cohort of participants with Parkinsonism (PD, MSAp, PSP), working closely with the Parkinson Study Group. The reason to test this in the Parkinson Study Group network, is because they are the community that evaluates Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in Parkinsonism. This web-based software tool will be capable of reading raw diffusion imaging data, performing quality assurance procedures, analyzing the data using a validated pipeline, and providing imaging metrics and diagnostic probability. We will test the performance of the wAID-P by enrolling 315 total subjects (105 PD, 105 MSAp, 105 PSP) across 21 sites in the Parkinson Study Group. Each site will perform imaging, clinical scales, diagnosis, and will upload the data to the web-based software tool. The clinical diagnosis will be blinded to the diagnostic algorithm and the imaging diagnosis will be compared to the movement disorders trained neurologist diagnosis. We will also enroll a portion of the cohort into a brain bank to ascertain pathological confirmation and to test the algorithm against cases with post-mortem diagnoses. The final outcome will be to disseminate a validated diagnostic algorithm to the Parkinson neurological and radiological community and to make it available to all on a website. NARRATIVE In this proposal, we will be developing, disseminating, and evaluating a web-based software tool that can perform MRI analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinsonism. Our goal is to leverage our years of experience and algorithm development, to test a prospective cohort of Parkinson’s disease, Multiple System Atrophy, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. We expect that at the end of the project, we will have validated a web-based software tool that can use MRIs from different vendors to read, analyze, and predict the diagnosis of different forms of Parkinsonism.",Web-based Automated Imaging Differentiation of Parkinsonism,10106864,U01NS119562,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Water', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm development', 'atypical parkinsonism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'data exchange', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'web site']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,U01,2021,1553260
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,10187663,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,75097
"Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease ABSTRACT Dr. Kara Smith is a Movement Disorders neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) whose goal is to become an independent investigator focused on early cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD). Her long-term goal is to develop speech markers of cognitive impairment in PD. Cognitive impairment occurs in the majority of PD patients, leading to increased mortality and decreased quality of life. The current diagnostic tools are resource-intensive and have limited sensitivity. Treatments are often offered late in the course of cognitive decline and do not provide optimal benefit. Speech markers could improve detection, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in PD. Speech markers could be monitored frequently and remotely via mobile technology, capturing sensitive, quantitative data about cognitive function in the context of patients’ daily life and in response to therapeutics. Dr. Smith’s role as a clinical movement disorders specialist ideally positions her to lead the application of advanced speech and language research to feasible, patient-oriented tools for real-life clinical practice and clinical trials. Dr. Smith has assembled an expert interdisciplinary mentorship team ideally suited for the goals of this innovative proposal. Dr. Smith and her team have previously shown that a) speech acoustic markers are associated with cognitive function in non-demented PD patients, and b) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment had linguistic deficits including pauses within utterances and grammaticality. Building on these results, Dr. Smith proposes to study speech and language more comprehensively in PD patients with and without mild cognitive impairment and controls to confirm these preliminary results and identify additional biomarkers. The aims of this study will be 1) to develop algorithms using speech acoustic markers to categorize by cognitive status, 2) to identify linguistic markers associated with mild cognitive impairment in PD, and 3) to assess on-line syntactic processing in PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The overall goal of the proposal is to identify speech and language markers of early cognitive dysfunction that can be further refined, validated and implemented using mobile technology into a larger scale, longitudinal R01 proposal. Further work will also address the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these speech markers. Dr. Smith’s rigorous training plan includes a Master’s degree, linguistics and speech motor physiology courses, and experience in signal processing and speech acoustic analysis. Through her training goals, she will advance her knowledge and skills in patient-centered outcomes measures and instrument validation. She will gain experience in research leadership, presentation and dissemination of scientific work, and in grant writing, culminating in an R01 proposal. This K23 award will be critical for Dr. Smith to establish an independent career as a PD clinician-scientist at the unique intersection of speech and language science and cognitive impairment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Speech markers have the potential to improve diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the majority of PD patients will develop cognitive impairment, the tools available to assess and treat this disabling complication are fraught with limitations. As a detailed and quantitative assessment tool, speech markers may increase sensitivity to early cognitive dysfunction and to changes over time compared with current measures. They may be automated and then implemented through mobile technology to increase patients’ access to cognitive symptom monitoring outside of the clinic setting. Dr. Smith’s proposed career development plan has potential to fill a major gap in PD research by making inexpensive and easy-to-use cognitive assessment tools accessible to patients in rural and international settings, and by fueling clinical trials to discover new therapeutics capable of slowing cognitive decline in PD.",Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,10115019,K23DC016656,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical movement disorder', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'common symptom', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'large scale data', 'lexical retrieval', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'motor deficit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2021,189216
"Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models ABSTRACT  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), afflicting tens of millions worldwide. The characteristic disease symptoms arise from basal ganglia dysfunction that occurs secondary to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Symptomatic treatment is focused either on replacing dopamine or disrupting aberrant activity through deep- brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus or the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in the primate, internal globus pallidus (GPi). This proposal is aimed at understanding the function and dysfunction of basal ganglia circuitry in mice, at the output of the basal ganglia to motor thalamus. In Aim 1, we will develop strategies to identify basal ganglia-recipient motor thalamus neurons in ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus (VA/VL), and characterize their projection targets and cortical inputs in awake, behaving animals. In Aim 2, we will use sophisticated in vivo strategies to record from posterior EP neurons and VA/VL neurons as animals move their limbs during locomotion, a fixed repetitive behavior. We will perturb activity in this pathway using optogenetics to determine the contribution of activity in these neurons to forelimb movements, and we will examine how activity in this pathway is altered after loss of striatal dopamine. In Aim 3, we will perform similar experiments in mice performing a lever-pulling task, a flexible forelimb movement. We will examine both cued and uncued versions of this task to distinguish activity generated internally vs. externally. Finally, we will examine how loss of striatal dopamine impacts EP and VA/VL activity during flexible forelimb movements. Our overarching goal is to understand how loss of striatal dopamine in PD leads to disruptions in basal ganglia circuit function and motor deficits, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating PD motor symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, most of which innervate the basal ganglia. Here, we propose to study the effects of dopamine loss in mice, focusing on the function of the entopeduncular nucleus (a rodent equivalent of the internal globus pallidus, major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and a site of deep brain stimulation in PD) and the ventral motor thalamus. Remarkably, the function of these regions remains mysterious, yet they hold great promise for understanding PD and developing new therapeutic strategies for treating PD symptoms.",Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models,10093142,R01NS064984,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Axon', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dopamine', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Eye Movements', 'Forelimb', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homologous Gene', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Subthalamic structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'awake', 'base', 'body position', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'density', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'endopeduncular nucleus', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'parkinsonian rodent', 'pars compacta', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NINDS,J.

"System Dynamics of PD-1 Signaling in T Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adaptive immune responses are governed by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, which determines the fates and activities of T cells (helper, effector, etc.). The TCR and its signaling partners integrate antigen-recognition signals and second signals, which carry information about the context in which antigen presentation is occurring. Second signals can be either stimulatory or inhibitory: stimulatory signals are essential for T cell activation, whereas inhibitory signals (also called checkpoints) are responsible for T cell exhaustion and antigen tolerance. Stimulatory second signals are generated by the innate arm of the immune system when, for example, signaling by Toll-like receptors induces expression of the B7-family ligands B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on antigen-presenting cells. Expression of B7-1/B7-2 indicates that antigen presentation is occurring within the context of an ongoing innate immune response. B7-1 and B7-2 are recognized by CD28, a TCR coreceptor that potently enhances TCR-generated T-cell activation signals. Inhibitory second signals arise during the course of chronic stimulation of TCR signaling. They are important for limiting the collateral damage caused by an immune response and avoidance of autoimmunity, but they can also be deleterious. For example, tumor cells commonly express the B7-family ligands B7-H1 (PD-L1/CD274) and B7-DC (PD- L2/CD273), which are recognized by PD-1, a TCR coreceptor that inhibits TCR-generated T-cell activation signals. B7-H1/B7-DC expression conveys immune privilege to tumor cells. For these and other reasons, it is imperative that we improve our basic understanding of checkpoint signaling. Here, we propose to characterize the dynamics of PD-1-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat E6-1, HuT 78, and TALL-104 cells, CRISPR-engineered cells derived from these parental cell lines, and primary human CD8+ cells. We will apply quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain an unbiased, nearly comprehensive picture of phosphotyrosine (pTyr) site abundances with and without PD-1/CD28 coreceptor signaling in populations of T cells over time and across conditions. Concurrently, using fluorescence microscopy and engineered SH2 domain affinity reagents, we will characterize single-molecule patterns of multisite phosphorylation for TCR, CD28, and PD-1. We will also measure membrane-recruitment lifetimes for individual cytosolic signaling partners of these receptors. The resulting data will be used to drive the formulation and parameterization of a detailed mechanistic model for TCR signaling accounting for the effects of CD28 and PD-1 coactivation. Although PD-1 is viewed as a platform for recruitment of phosphatases that counteract activation signals from kinases, we will evaluate specific hypotheses about how PD-1 could potentially generate positive signals for T-cell activation. These hypotheses are motivated by the fact that the best characterized signaling partners of PD-1 are protein tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, which are known to promote cell activation in other contexts by, for example, mediating the dephosphorylation of inhibitory pTyr sites. Model predictions will be tested. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will characterize PD-1 immune checkpoint signaling dynamics in T cells by using quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, bioinformatics, and mechanistic mathematical modeling. A better basic understanding of PD-1 signaling, which plays an important role in avoidance of autoimmunity and escape of cancer cells and pathogens from immune surveillance, has the potential to motivate evaluation of new therapeutic strategies for diverse diseases.",System Dynamics of PD-1 Signaling in T Cells,10211871,R01AI153617,"['Accounting', 'Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B7-DC antigen', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'CD28 gene', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD80 gene', 'CD86 gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Formulation', 'Human', 'ITAM', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'NR0B2 gene', 'Oncology', 'PTPN11 gene', 'PTPN6 gene', 'Pattern', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Play', 'Population', 'Protein Dephosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Role', 'SYK gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Tyrosine Phosphorylation', 'Validation', 'Western Blotting', 'ZAP-70 Gene', 'adaptive immune response', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'chronic infection', 'dectin 1', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'immune activation', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'response', 'single molecule']",NIAID,"TRIAD NATIONAL SECURITY, LLC",R01,2021,784623
"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,10149422,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Glean', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&apos', 's Disease Rating Scale', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Theory', 'Work', 'base', 'disease heterogeneity', 'dopamine transporter', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'neuron loss', 'presynaptic', 'progression marker', 'putamen', 'research clinical testing', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'uptake']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352779
