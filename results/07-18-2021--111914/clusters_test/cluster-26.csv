"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,10162472,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'heterogenous data', 'hologram', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,283097
"Cooperative Control Robotics and Computer Vision: Development of Semi-Autonomous Temporal Bone and Skull Base Surgery Project Summary I am an assistant professor in the department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where my practice is focused on neurotology and lateral skull base surgery. I am applying for a mentored surgeon-scientist career development award (CDA) to obtain further training in robotics, deep learning and computer vision. This will further my long-term career goals of improving neurotologic surgical outcomes through novel applications of engineering methods and ultimately to investigate semi-autonomous, robotic interventions in the inner ear and skull base which are beyond the limits of the human hand alone.  Operating in the temporal bone and lateral skull base is technically demanding due to complex three- dimensional anatomy, small working spaces and delicate neurovascular structures. Many of these challenges are ideally suited to semi-autonomous surgical platforms to augment a surgeon’s skills with robotic and image- guided assistance. Despite the widespread implementation of robotic surgery and image guidance in other areas of the body, the field of neurotology has had relatively little adoption of this technology. We believe one reason for this is the precise registration needed in this field, where millimeter differences differentiate a successful from a catastrophic result. This CDA proposes expanding on my prior work investigating cooperative control robotics and virtual safety barriers by using computer vision and deep learning networks to develop highly accurate surgical image registration. This CDA aims to provide me with multi-disciplinary training in the departments of Otolaryngology, Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. Specific training goals include: (1) Training in robotics, statistical shape modeling and computer tomography landmark segmentation, (2) Training in deep learning networks and computer vision video image registration, (3) Integrating this training, with my knowledge of temporal bone and skull base surgery to develop into an independent investigator (4) Pursue additional training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research.  The research plan addresses the hypothesis that virtual safety barriers can be accurately enforced by a cooperative control robot, and computer vision methods can be used to automate accurate placement and registration of these safety barriers. I believe that the integration of these techniques will allow for semi- autonomous surgical methods resulting in improved surgical safety and efficiency. The specific aims of the proposal are to: (1) Develop and Validate Cooperative Control Robot Enforced Virtual Safety Barriers for Cortical Mastoidectomy (2) Develop and Test Autonomous Segmentation of Lateral Skull Base Anatomy (3) Develop Video-Based, Fiducial-less, Surgical Image Registration to Detect and Update the 3-D Position of Temporal Bone Anatomy from Intraoperative Stereoscopic Microscope Video. Project Narrative The research proposed here will investigate the feasibility of using novel applications of computer vision and cooperative control robotics to enforce virtual safety barriers in neurotologic surgery. Our long-term goal is to develop semi-autonomous, robotic methods to improve the safety and efficiency of neurotologic surgery, and open the possibilities for surgical interventions which currently are beyond the abilities of the human hand alone.",Cooperative Control Robotics and Computer Vision: Development of Semi-Autonomous Temporal Bone and Skull Base Surgery,10283480,K08DC019708,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Automobiles', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cadaver', 'Cochlea', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Dura Mater', 'Electromagnetics', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Facial nerve structure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Labyrinth', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Sigmoid colon', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Update', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'image guided', 'image registration', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'medical schools', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'professor', 'responsible research conduct', 'robot control', 'simulation', 'skills', 'skull base', 'stereoscopic', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'virtual', 'vision development']",NIDCD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,191792
"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user’s location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user’s location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user’s trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,10129965,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Infrastructure', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Needs Assessment', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schools', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,403882
