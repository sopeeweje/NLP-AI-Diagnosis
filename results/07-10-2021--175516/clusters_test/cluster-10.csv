"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,10082437,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'High grade dysplasia', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,319318,641965656
"Using Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing to Monitor and Evaluate Public Information and Communication Disparities about Colon Cancer Screening PROJECT SUMMARY Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and death rates are higher among Black Americans than non-Hispanic White Americans. While some CRC-related disparities have decreased (e.g., incidence and stage of presentation), disparities persist in the context of CRC screening (CRCS). Studies suggest that supportive and information-rich social networks, both online and offline, could improve CRCS among Black Americans. A growing body of evidence indicates the importance of online sources of health information seeking and scanning about CRC and CRCS, but little is known about the impact of the messages that individuals are encountering on these platforms. Research on the content and volume of messages White and Black Americans encounter from online health information sources is still unclear—particularly regarding any disparities that exist about what specific information is sought, scanned, or shared by Black Americans. There is a critical need to understand which messages resonate among populations at-risk for specific diseases (e.g., CRC) and who may have concerns about engaging in early detection behaviors (e.g., CRCS) and may face disparities in exposure to public information online. The proposed project utilizes and applies novel cancer communication surveillance approaches (e.g., natural language processing and crowdsourcing) to examine public health communication about CRC prevention and control. Aim 1 will use computational, natural language processing approaches to capture and analyze digital and social media information about CRC and CRCS to identify prominent messages, sources and types of misinformation, and information inequalities. This approach offers an efficient, effective, and responsive method to monitor (mis)information and emerging messages about CRCS. Aim 2 will use a crowdsourcing approach (wiki surveys) to assess population perceptions of public information and messages about CRCS. Recruiting nationally representative samples of White (N = 1,000) and Black American (N = 1,000) adults ages 45-74, we will use an innovative data collection procedure known as wiki surveys to rank candidate messages as potential message targets in strategic efforts to promote CRCS. For Aim 3, we will conduct a randomized controlled message trial (N = 1,600) to determine the validity of the wiki survey approach to selecting messages for targeted audience segments. We will use data collected from Study 2 to identify four sets of messages with strong arguments respective to each target audience’s rankings: highest rated messages for both audiences, highest rated messages for target in-group, highest rated messages for target out-group, and middle-/median-rated messages. We will cross those message categories with target audience (White/Black American) to test if messages selected via the wiki survey are associated with intentions to adhere to screening recommendations in the future and share CRCS messages. The project will offer evidence to help determine the validity and scalability of these novel methods, which is essential to innovate formative research and evaluation approaches in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE Efforts to improve public health communication about colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRC screening (CRCS) require understanding what information is commonly seen by target audiences and consideration of existing information and behavior disparities for populations at higher risk for CRC (e.g., Black Americans). The current project uses novel computational approaches to monitor the public communication environment about CRCS, crowdsourcing to engage in formative evaluation of possible message content, and a randomized, controlled trial to validate these computational and crowdsourcing approaches. The project tests novel approaches to monitor and evaluate public health information to inform health communication research and practice.",Using Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing to Monitor and Evaluate Public Information and Communication Disparities about Colon Cancer Screening,10187999,R37CA259156,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Communication Research', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Death Rate', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Policy', 'Health Promotion', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Information and Media', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'United States', 'Woman', 'caucasian American', 'colon cancer screening', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'digital media', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'formative assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'social media', 'wiki']",NCI,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,396908,18270482
